本港食水檢測計劃嚴格按照國際標準進行,2025-06-14 19:55,2025-06-14 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400892.htm,"​就有傳媒報道不同地區的食水樣本驗出有雜質，發展局發言人指出有關報道提及的測試並非按照香港食水檢測計劃嚴格遵從的國際標準而進行。

發言人表示，據悉相關媒體主要是從水龍頭「起泡器」（俗稱沙隔）收集雜質樣本，再把樣本放進水中交予化驗。「起泡器」屬濾網配件，一般家居水龍頭和花灑頭普遍裝有類似配件，有助阻隔雜質，因此從「沙隔」收集的樣本含有雜質，正是「沙隔」的功能，並非不正常現象。過往，水務署亦曾接獲類似查詢，並即時派員到場檢查，安排沖洗用戶處所的水錶和提醒用戶清洗「沙隔」，同時檢視水質是否有異常情況。若懷疑水質有問題，水務署會抽取食水樣本進行化驗，並將結果通知用戶。事實上，過往三年，只有零星的這類個案需要檢驗食水樣本，而測試結果亦顯示食水樣本符合香港食水標準。

發言人強調，食水水質的測試必須根據國際標準進行，其中包括參考國際標準化組織的ISO5667標準進行樣本採集，並參考中國國家標準GB/T 5750及美國公共衛生協會(APHA)等機構制定的測試方法和程序進行，而檢驗的樣本必須是食水樣本，而並非如相關媒體所安排檢驗從「沙隔」收集的樣本。換言之，取樣的樣本、方法和程序均會影響測試的有效性和代表性。

發言人指出，相關報道提及從「沙隔」收集的雜質為樹脂、膠、玻璃膠等，這有機會與大廈內部供水系統內的喉管或其裝置物料剝落有關。這些物質不溶於水，若發現如此情況，應盡快安排清洗內部供水系統。一般而言，若大廈的內部供水系統能恆常妥善清潔及保養，可有效避免系統內積存過多沉積物，減少「沙隔」出現雜質情況。事實上，水務署供應的食水經過嚴格處理程序，符合香港食水標準。然而，食水途經的公共喉管及大廈內部喉管可能因老舊、水壓等原因而出現物料剝落情況，故此需要安裝濾網，而業主、註冊代理人和管理處必須持續妥善地保養樓宇內部供水系統，包括定期清潔地下水箱及天台水箱，以免積聚污垢或鐵銹等，以及定期操作閥門、清洗過濾器及沖洗地下供水管，以保持用戶水龍頭食水水質優良。

為確保本港的食水水質，水務署實施恆常食水檢測計劃，每年透過隨機方法在全港約28 000多個公眾可接觸到的水龍頭（如商場、社區設施、體育場地、政府合署等）中抽取水樣本作測試，抽樣比例根據國際標準方法取樣，而涵蓋的食水參數按照世衞的準則而訂立。此外，水務署每年在全港住宅及非住宅食水帳戶中隨機選出約670個處所，在其水龍頭抽取食水樣本，以檢測六種金屬（即銻、鎘、鉻、銅、鉛和鎳），確保符合香港食水標準。相關檢測結果會定時刊登在水務署的網頁。

發言人表示，水務署接獲相關媒體查詢時已要求其提供更詳細資料以便與相關用戶跟進，現仍等待該媒體提供進一步資料。若有關媒體向水務署提交更多資料（包括採樣地點），署方會派員跟進調查，協助用戶沖洗內部供水系統，並按需要抽取水樣本進行化驗，確保水質安全。如市民就食水水質問題有任何查詢，可致電水務署24小時熱線：2824 5000。"
International Conference on Roads and Railways 2025 successfully concludes On-site visits to Central Kowloon Route and MTRCL Tung Chung Line Extension works projects (with photos),2025-06-14 19:51,2025-06-14 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400789.htm,"The International Conference on Roads and Railways 2025 co-organised by the Highways Department (HyD) and the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation already came to a successful conclusion yesterday (June 13). The two-day conference attracted over 800 participants, successfully bringing together global experts, scholars and industry leaders to share experiences and insights, and jointly lead Hong Kong's transport infrastructure development to write a new chapter.

In his opening remarks and speech on the second day of the conference, Vice President of the Research Institute of Highway of the Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China, Mr Wang Shuiyin, inspired the participants to think about how to put smart and green road construction into practice. The conference then focused on Smart and Green Transport Infrastructure - Planning, Design and Construction and Green Solutions for Smart Transport Infrastructure, with in-depth discussions on the topics of innovative designs, construction and material technologies, smart monitoring technologies, strategies to cope with extreme weather, etc., which provided multi-faceted solutions for the promotion of smart and green transport infrastructure. Students studying relevant engineering subjects were invited to participate in the conference. This enabled them to understand the future development of transport infrastructure, as well as the breakthroughs in innovative technologies of the engineering sector. Deputy Director of Highways, Mr Richard Ng, said in his closing remarks that the conference inspired Hong Kong to create sustainable solutions through policy innovation and technological innovation in order to respond to various challenges in the implementation of transport infrastructures, while deepening international co-operation. He also expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the guests, speakers, supporting organisations and all participants for their participation which had made the conference a success.

Tied in with the theme of Building Smart and Green Transport Infrastructure, around 60 participants were arranged in two delegations to respectively visit the works sites of two major infrastructure projects, the Central Kowloon Route (CKR) and the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) Tung Chung Line Extension (TUE), witnessing the achievements of Hong Kong's transport infrastructure.

As one of the strategic transport infrastructure projects in Hong Kong, the CKR has entered the final stage of construction works. It is expected to reach readiness for official commissioning by December this year and will be named as the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) by then. One of the highlights of today's visit to the CKR project is the first crossing of the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) mainly composed of a tunnel, which is about 4.7 kilometres long, with a tunnel of about 3.9 km in length and more than 100 metres deep underground, and three ventilation buildings located along the way at Yau Ma Tei, Ho Man Tin and Kai Tak respectively. The scale of the tunnel far exceeds that of the Central-Wanchai Bypass and is comparable to the Tai Lam Tunnel. The tunnel is equipped with a comprehensive traffic control and surveillance system, enabling the controlling officers to closely monitor the operation of the tunnel from the control room of Kai Tak Administration Building and make prompt response when necessary.

The project team of the HyD introduced to the delegation their self-invented and multi-international award-winning Smart Site Management Hub, which effectively monitors the works progress of the entire project under different works contracts in a unified manner by integrating various data of innovative technologies, thereby enhancing site safety and construction quality. The delegation then visited the Kai Tak Interchange, Kai Tak Depressed Road and entrance of Yau Ma Tei Tunnel, as well as the works site at Kansu Street in Yau Ma Tei to understand how the project team had overcome the challenges encountered during construction, including tunnel excavation, re-provisioning of Gascoigne Road Flyover, etc in the dense urban areas. The project team also shared the people-oriented engineering philosophy of the project in striving to conserve the nearby heritages and iconic landmarks when implementing works, as well as first re-provisioning the public facilities affected, taking full account of cultural conservation and community needs. The delegation was specially arranged to visit the Former Yau Ma Tei Police Station to gain a deep understanding of the history of the century-old building and conservation engineering technology.

Another delegation visited the MTRCL TUE project, which is composed of Tung Chung East (TCE) and Tung Chung West (TCW) Sections, amidst including the new TCE Station constructed between the existing Sunny Bay Station and Tung Chung Station, as well as an approximately 1.3-km-long extension from the existing Tung Chung Station for construction of the new TCW Station. The project is targeted for completion by 2029, and will effectively enhance Tung Chung's internal and external connectivity, and promote sustainable community development upon commissioning. The project team shared and exchanged experiences on integrating innovative technologies and infrastructure construction with the delegation, and arranged visits to the two works sites to gain a deeper understanding of the works progress.

In addition, young members from professional bodies and organisations, including the Hong Kong Institution of Highways and Transportation, the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers, the Institution of Civil Engineers Hong Kong Association, and the University of Hong Kong Engineering Alumni Association, etc to will be arranged to visit the CKR works site next Saturday (June 21). They will have a closer look on how complex underground works were carried out in the urban areas with lots of buildings, dense population and high traffic flow under the project.

律政司司長在「香港青年內地法律專業實習計劃2025」啓動禮致辭全文（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-06-14 19:04,2025-06-14 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400797.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（六月十四日）在「香港青年內地法律專業實習計劃2025」啓動禮致辭全文：

各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位同學：

大家下午好。首先，真的很高興出席今日的開班典禮，我都數不清自己第幾次來，自二○一六年開始，期間應該是間斷了，今年好像是第七年，我是很開心的，因為能夠看着這個活動的成長，人數越來越多，今年有超過100人。你們的安排是非常全面的，如果我沒有記錯，在下一個星期你們會去北京，拜訪不同的部委，包括港澳辦（國務院港澳事務辦公室）、基本法委員會（全國人民代表大會常務委員會香港特別行政區基本法委員會）等。這些機會其實真的很難得，因為就算我們這些成年人，也不是經常有機會去這些地方，所以真的要好好去認識一下，聆聽內地單位的領導，究竟對於香港的學生，或對於香港的年青人有什麼期望。訪問完北京之後，如果我又沒有記錯，之後你們會有數星期，可能分批有些會去北京，有些會去上海，分別會到一些律所（律師事務所）、大企業，或者仲裁機關做實習。當然，環境會不一樣，但其實也有很大的機會，內地的律所，跟香港的律所會有一定的分別，企業法務其實很多時候都很大規模，有時候內地企業的內部法律部門，比香港的律所還要大，或是律師的人數，仲裁機關更是如此。現在內地很積極發展一些涉外仲裁和國際仲裁，相信大家都會獲益良多。

但我很「嫉妒」你們，因為你們真是很幸運，有這麼好的主辦機構，還有這麼多支持機構幫助你們籌辦安排如此多活動。我有很大感觸，想起我的年代，即三十多年前，我記得我太太和我分享過，她當年暑假有些交流活動都是去上海，是如何去的呢？是坐船去，好像是坐幾日船。我想你們都沒有聽過要坐船去上海，但我們那一輩的人就會有這些經歷，你可以想像到落差有多大，所以你們都是很幸運的人。但是幸運的人，是要付出「代價」的，所以我今天要你們付出一些「代價」，是甚麼呢？我有兩個很重要的任務希望交給你們，在這個課程裏面有兩個身份和角色希望你們可以扮演得很好，第一是做一個「好學生」——做一個很主動的學生，因為實習的時候，你會接觸到一個新的環境，接觸到關於內地的法律、制度，這些都是很陌生的事，但千萬不要害羞，不要想着只是去實習，就很被動地旁觀聆聽，觀察當然是好，但亦需要珍惜這個機會主動發問，不明白的話可以多了解，我相信內地的朋友是很樂意回答你們的問題，所以第一點就是要很主動、不要害羞。

第二是要做一個「全面」的學生，全面的意思是什麼呢？雖然是法律實習，但我很相信你們心裏面參與這個計劃不是只為了認識法律，而是希望可以在參與之餘玩樂一下，這是一點也不錯，我很鼓勵你們在公餘時間盡量認識多些朋友，到北京、上海逛街吃喝，了解一下我們國家實實在在的社會建設，了解一下現在年輕人的生活潮流。我們很需要認識國家，認識國家是需要投入別人的生活，所以我鼓勵你們，只要不做一些違規的事情，是可以「放縱」一下。

第三是要有一個謙卑的態度，做一個謙卑的學生，我知道你們當中有幾位是內地的法律學生，很多是來自政法大學的朋友，除此之外大部分都是在香港經過普通法訓練出來的學生。我們一定是驕傲的，因為我們很相信，香港的普通法制度在國際間都享有一個比較領先的地位，難免會有感到驕傲或優越的感覺，這一點也沒有錯。但當我們接觸到內地的法律制度，認識到這與我們的法律制度是有差異的時候，一定要保持謙卑的心去了解，究竟為何內地的法律制度和我們香港的法律制度不同，為何社會環境會產生這樣的差異，又要如何跟香港的法律制度去配合，這需要用謙卑的態度去了解。

所以第一，要做一個剛才我所說的那類特別的「好學生」，第二，更加重要的是做一個好的「推銷員」，好的「推銷員」是什麼意思呢？你要反過來與跟你們相處的內地律師，或者其他朋友「推銷」，其實他們都很好奇，當然他們會有接待香港朋友的經驗，但是接觸好像你們這種年紀的香港法律學生，或年輕人，可能不是每個人都有機會，我相信他們心目中應該都有很多東西想問你們，例如你們在香港生活的情況，香港的法律制度是怎樣的，香港現在有什麼問題，他們可能觀察到香港發生了很多事情，但不太明白。所以你們有很重大的責任，就是你們代表的不只是自己個人的身份，在別人眼中，你們就是代表了香港的未來，你們就是我們香港的年青一輩，在將來法律上應該是扮演一個很重要角色的年青人。內地如何看待我們香港的未來，內地如何看待我們香港未來在法律上是否作出了我們應該有的貢獻呢？其實會在你們身上做一個評估。所以我很希望，如果遇到這種情況，要主動一點，多跟內地的朋友解釋一下，分享你們對於香港的自身體驗，對於我們香港社會的認識，或者作為我們法律制度，普通法的好處在哪裡呢？有甚麼特別呢？為何我們這個普通法制度，可以幫助不單是香港，甚至是整個國家的發展呢？香港發生了很多事，內地人未必明白為何香港會這樣，我想你們有一個很重大的責任，亦是我所期望的，盡量取得機會令內地朋友了解。「一國兩制」要成功，我覺得要有一個很重要的先決條件，就是內地和香港朋友需要互相理解和信任，因為大家畢竟是生活在兩個不同的制度之下，是會有差異的，有些事情是大家都未必能容易明白，但不要將這些不理解變成一些讓大家可能互相不充分信任的結果。所以我很希望大家珍惜這段時間，去認識多些朋友，坦誠相向，促進兩個地方的朋友，互相的理解。今天你們交朋結友，可能幾十年之後，就變成了老朋友。

這就是我交給你們的任務，做一個好學生，第二，幫香港做一個好的「推銷員」。最後，祝大家有個愉快的夏天，努力學習，努力遊樂，努力去享受你們這個難得的機會，多謝大家。"

衞生署舉辦「香港牙科服務新里程」研討會　慶祝牙科服務成立八十周年（附圖）,2025-06-14 17:00,2025-06-14 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400526.htm,"​衞生署今日（六月十四日）於香港故宮文化博物館演講廳舉辦題為「香港牙科服務新里程」的研討會，邀請內地和海外知名牙科學者和本地業界探討促進口腔健康的路向和措施，為香港牙科服務的可持續發展注入新動能，同時慶祝衞生署牙科服務成立八十周年的重要里程碑。

醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授、衞生署署長林文健醫生、現任衞生署牙科服務主任顧問醫生許美賢醫生，聯同衞生署四位前任牙科服務主任顧問醫生一同為研討會的開幕式主禮。

盧寵茂教授在致辭時說：「口腔健康是整體健康不可或缺的一環。政府去年底公布的口腔健康及牙科護理工作小組總結報告，引領香港將口腔健康及牙科護理體系由『重治療、輕預防』，扭轉為『重預防、早發現、早治療』。通過『做闊做淺』的策略廣泛向所有年齡層市民推廣以預防為重的基層口腔健康護理，並以『做窄做深』的策略聚焦為弱勢社群提供必需的治療性牙科護理服務。」

他強調，政府今年三月推出的「青少年護齒共同治理先導計劃」正是「做闊做淺」的項目，鼓勵青少年預防牙患；而上月剛推出的「社區牙科支援計劃」則屬於「做窄做深」的措施，為弱勢社群（包括有經濟困難的長者）加強提供牙科服務。政府期望與牙科專業界別、培訓機構、非政府組織，以及市民大眾攜手合作，共同迎接香港牙科服務的新紀元，持續推進各項措施，共同推動全民口腔健康。

林文健醫生致歡迎辭時說：「衞生署牙科服務自一九四五年成立，八十年來有長足發展。從戰後初期以提供緊急脫牙服務為主，到一九六一年香港食水加入氟化物以應對及預防牙患，至一九八○年為全港小學生推出以預防為本、深受家長歡迎的學童牙科保健服務，以及後來為有特殊口腔護理需要的人士提供的醫院牙科專科服務，夯實各項針對長者及社會弱勢社群的各項社區牙科護理計劃等，衞生署牙科服務正不斷擴展，迎合社會需求，提質提量。」

他指出，衞生署牙科服務致力與香港一同成長，日後會繼續以政策革新、善用科技及社會協作，積極落實各項口腔健康行動計劃，重點為市民提供預防性護理，並為弱勢群體推行專項社區牙科服務，促進全港市民的口腔健康，保存牙齒。

世界衞生組織（世衞）西太平洋區域主任Saia Ma'u Piukala醫生亦為研討會發表視像致辭。世界衞生組織口腔健康科學轉化合作中心主任小川祐司教授、北京大學口腔醫學院口腔預防保健科主任鄭樹國教授及英國倫敦大學學院特殊護理牙科顧問醫生Navdeep Kumar則擔任主講嘉賓，分別闡述了世衞的《口腔衞生全球戰略和行動計劃（2023-2030年）》、內地在促進全球口腔健康的政策和實踐工作、為有特殊需求的成年患者提供牙科護理的挑戰與創新等議題。

研討會亦邀請了十六間一直積極參與「長者牙科外展服務計劃」、「護齒同行」及「特殊口腔護理服務」等政府資助牙科項目的非政府組織及合作夥伴出席，分享他們在服務長者及有特殊需要社群方面的豐碩成果。

除研討會外，衞生署口腔健康促進科以牙科服務成立八十周年為主題佈置的陽光笑容流動教室，將會巡迴全港各區向全民推廣口腔健康。詳情稍後將於「愛牙 Love Teeth HK」Facebook專頁公布。"
"DH organises symposium on ""A New Era for Dental Services in Hong Kong"" to celebrate 80th anniversary of its Dental Services (with photos)",2025-06-14 17:00,2025-06-14 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400527.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (June 14) organised a symposium entitled ""A New Era for Dental Services in Hong Kong"" at the Auditorium of the Hong Kong Palace Museum. Renowned dental academics from the Mainland and overseas, as well as local dental professionals explored the way forward and measures to promote oral health and foster the sustainable development of the dental services in Hong Kong. The symposium also celebrated the important milestone of the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the DH's Dental Services.

The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau; the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; the incumbent Consultant in-charge of the Dental Services of the DH, Dr Kitty Hse; and four former Consultant in-charge of the Dental Services of the DH officiated at the opening ceremony of the symposium.

In his address, Professor Lo said, ""Oral health is vital to overall health. At the end of last year, the Government released the final report of the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care, shifting the focus of Hong Kong's oral health and dental care system from treatment-oriented to an approach targeting prevention, early identification and timely intervention. The Government adopts the strategies of widely promoting among citizens across all age groups prevention-oriented primary oral healthcare, and provides essential curative dental care services targeting underprivileged groups.""

He stressed that the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme for Adolescents launched by the Government in March 2025 is an initiative of widely promoting among citizens, encouraging adolescents to prevent dental diseases while the Community Dental Support Programme launched last month is an initiative focusing on enhancing dental services for the underprivileged (including elderly who have financial difficulties). The Government looks forward to collaborating with the dental professionals, training institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the members of the public to usher in a new era of dental services in Hong Kong, and continue to enhance various initiatives to promote oral health for all.

Dr Lam said in his welcoming speech, ""Since its establishment in 1945, the Dental Services of the DH has achieved significant development over the past 80 years. From providing emergency dental extraction service during the post-war period to introducing fluoridation of drinking water in Hong Kong in 1961 to combat and prevent dental diseases; to rolling out the prevention-oriented School Dental Care Service for all primary school students in Hong Kong in 1980, which has been well-received by parents; to providing specialist dental services to patients with special healthcare needs; and to implementing various community dental care programmes to cater for the needs of the elderly and underprivileged, etc. The Dental Services is expanding to meet the needs of the society, enhancing both the quality and quantity of services."" 

He added that the Dental Services of the DH endeavours to grow alongside Hong Kong, and will continue to actively implement the Oral Health Action Plan through policy innovations, leveraging on technology and community collaboration, with emphasis on providing preventive care to the public and special community dental services to underprivileged groups, in order to promote oral health and the retention of natural teeth.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for the Western Pacific, Dr Saia Ma'u Piukala, also delivered a video message for the symposium. The keynote speakers were Professor Hiroshi Ogawa, the Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Translation of Oral Health Science; Professor Zheng Shuguo, the Chairman of the Department of Preventive Dentistry of the School of Stomatology of Peking University; and Dr Navdeep Kumar, Consultant in Special Care Dentistry of University College London. They shared insights on topics such as the WHO Global Strategy and Action Plan on Oral Health (2023-2030), the Mainland's policy and efforts to promote global oral health, and the challenges and innovations in providing dental care to adult patients with special needs.

Sixteen NGOs and partners who have been actively participating in government-subsidised dental programmes such as Outreach Dental Care Programme for the Elderly, Healthy Teeth Collaboration and Special Oral Care Service, were invited to attend the symposium to share their fruitful achievements in serving the elderly and persons with special needs.

Apart from the symposium, the Bright Smiles Mobile Classroom of the DH's Oral Health Promotion Division, decorated with a theme celebrating the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the Dental Services, will tour around Hong Kong districts to promote oral health to the public. Details will be announced on the Facebook fan page of ""æç Love Teeth HK"" later. "

The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

As a legal professional working closely with international businesses, I have seen firsthand how Canada and Hong Kong businesses can benefit namely through the Hong Kong-Canada Income Tax Agreement. Together, we are building a future of shared prosperity and ambition, backed by strong trade and investment agreements and a long-term commitment to sustainable growth."""

Employers and employees should make prior work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-06-14 12:20,2025-06-14 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400350.htm," As the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 (T3) is now in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (June 14) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of establishments, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

 ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements and contingency measures for periods during and after tropical cyclone warnings and rainstorm warnings, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

 To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees, as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or when the extreme conditions come to an end, and when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions.

 ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when a tropical cyclone warning, rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

 When a Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement is issued during working hours, within two hours before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is expected to take effect, employers should release employees from workplaces or from work in stages or arrange for them to work remotely according to the agreed work arrangements. To ensure the safety of employees and to enable them to arrive home before suspension of public transport services, employees who have mobility problems (for example, pregnant employees or those with a disability), employees who rely on transport services which are prone to being affected by adverse weather conditions (for example, ferry services) to get home, and those who work in or are living in remote areas (for example, outlying islands) should be given priority to leave. Other employees should be released from workplaces or from work in stages according to their travelling distance or the time required for returning home.

If an Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance on the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) or higher, Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

The spokesman also reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

 ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.

Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when there is a T8 signal or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
僱主僱員應預先訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-06-14 12:20,2025-06-14 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400346.htm,"由於三號熱帶氣旋警告信號現已生效，勞工處今日（六月十四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主在擬訂及執行在熱帶氣旋及暴雨警告下及其後的工作安排和應變措施時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。

當天文台在工作時間內、預計八號熱帶氣旋警告信號生效前的兩小時內發出預警，僱主應按協定的工作安排讓僱員分批離開工作地點、下班或遙距工作。為確保僱員安全和趕及在公共交通服務停止前回家，一些行動不便的僱員（例如懷孕或殘疾僱員）、須依靠容易受惡劣天氣影響的交通服務（例如渡輪服務）返回居所的僱員，以及於偏遠地點工作或居住的僱員（例如離島），應獲准優先離開。僱主亦應安排其他僱員按返家路程的距離或所需時間分批離開工作地點或下班。

如果黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外及空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣或極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號、黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。

另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

Motorists should heed special traffic arrangements during smart motorway operational test at Ting Kau Bridge southbound at noon on June 21 (with photos/video),2025-06-14 10:00,2025-06-14 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061301147.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (June 14) announced that a smart motorway operational test will be conducted at the road section of Ting Kau Bridge southbound (Tsing Yi bound) at noon on June 21 (Saturday) for about 15 minutes.

During the test, the fast lane of Ting Kau Bridge southbound will be temporarily closed while the hard shoulder will be open for traffic for the first time. The speed limit will also be reduced to 50 km/h accordingly at the above road section. The TD reminds motorists to pay heed to the lane control signals and speed limits on site when passing through the road section at the above time, and follow the instructions for safe driving.

The trial of the Smart Motorway Pilot Scheme at Ting Kau Bridge southbound launched from December 29, 2024 has been operating smoothly to date. With the application of artificial intelligence technologies, the newly installed Automatic Incident Detection System effectively assists operation staff of the Tsing Ma Control Area in detecting and handling traffic incidents more expeditiously, allowing traffic to resume normal as soon as possible.

As of end-May 2025, the System has effectively detected a total of 16 traffic incidents occurred at the road section within a short time, most of which were minor traffic accidents. Among them, 11 incidents were detected within 10 seconds and immediate alerts were issued to operation staff for follow-up. Compared to the past where operation staff mainly relied on regular CCTV checks to identify traffic incidents, the detection time has now been significantly reduced by nearly 90 per cent, raising the efficiency and capability to respond to incidents.

A spokesman for the TD said, ""To further evaluate the effectiveness of the Pilot Scheme, we will conduct the operational test at noon on June 21, 2025 to assess motorists' compliance with the control signals and their proper use of the hard shoulder, and collect relevant operational data as reference for optimising the Pilot Scheme and formulating the implementation strategy of smart motorways in future.""

The TD will continue to monitor the Pilot Scheme in collaboration with relevant departments, and make suitable refinements to the System and operational arrangements with regard to actual circumstances to ensure road safety and safe motoring."

In his keynote speech at a seminar and networking reception themed ""From Hong Kong to the World: Embarking on the New Journey of Innovation"" organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), Professor Sun said Hong Kong is forging ahead with a clear vision to develop as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre, and is committed to pushing boundaries, embracing change, and seizing global opportunities.

Professor Sun said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been introducing agile policies, building world-class infrastructure and facilitating global I&T collaboration. He noted the flagship research and development (R&D) initiative, InnoHK, fosters global R&D collaboration. Hong Kong is also carrying out meticulous planning for building artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, including AI Supercomputing Centre opened last year and the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute to be established, together with $10 billion dollars-worth Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund channeling more market capital to turbocharge strategic industries, with AI at the core.

Highlighting that Hong Kong being an ideal gateway for global enterprises to enter the Mainland market, Professor Sun said the HKSAR Government has been actively attracting overseas and the Mainland I&T enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. Companies choosing HK for the international headquarters exemplify Hong Kong’s important role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world, serving as a two-way springboard for attracting overseas enterprises and helping Mainland enterprises to ""go global"".

During the seminar and networking reception, Professor Sun also exchanged views with members of the local I&T sector, investors and start-ups' founders on I&T development and collaboration.

Professor Sun also visited the Hong Kong Tech Pavilion. Twenty start-ups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and Cyberport participated this year, showcasing cutting-edge solutions and innovations in areas of AI, robotics, HealthTech, sustainable and ClimateTech, and Fintech. At the same time, Professor Sun toured the Canada Pavilion set up by Canada which was selected as country of the year for VivaTech 2025, the China Pavilion and pavilions set up by other leading enterprises and start-ups where he had a brief exchange with representatives of the participating organisations to learn more on their innovative solutions.

In the evening, Professor Sun met with Mr Emmanuel Carcassonne, the Chairman of La French Tech Hong Kong-Shenzhen, a community dedicated to supporting the development of the French startup ecosystem both in France and internationally. Professor Sun said that Hong Kong is a reliable partner for French startups to settle and expand businesses in Hong Kong.

In the afternoon, Professor Sun paid a courtesy call on Minister Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in France Mr Chen Li, to brief him on the work of developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre, enhancing the I&T ecosystem, fostering co-ordinated development among upstream, midstream and downstream, as well as the city's continuous efforts in integrating into national I&T development.

Professor Sun will continue his visit to Paris today (June 14, Paris time) and depart for the Netherlands on June 15 (Amsterdam time)."

Shirley (Special Representative for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Affairs to the European Union, Ms Shirley Yung), Christopher (Director of France, Spain and Portugal of the HKTDC, Mr Christopher Lai), distinguished speakers, guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon! Bonjour! What an honour to stand before you at VivaTech 2025, where the future unfolds in the heart of Paris, a city that has long been a powerhouse of creativity and innovation.

Walking through the exhibition earlier, I could sense the electric energy of young entrepreneurs, the boldness of the start-ups, and the sheer drive for innovation in every corner. It is a spirit Hong Kong knows well. Today, I am here to share how Hong Kong is not only keeping pace with this tech revolution, but also helping to lead it.

Driving innovation: Hong Kong's grand vision

Hong Kong is forging ahead with a clear vision – to become a leading international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. Guided by our I&T development blueprint (Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint) promulgated in December 2022, we have introduced a series of targeted measures to consolidate our research and development (R&D) strengths, accelerate transformation of R&D outcomes and promote the development of tech industries of strategically importance to us including life and health sciences, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, as well as advanced manufacturing and new energy. These efforts have significantly strengthened the I&T ecosystem in Hong Kong, putting us firmly on the right track to unlocking new possibilities.

But vision alone is not enough, we believe in action. Just as VivaTech embodies a spirit of exploration, Hong Kong is committed to pushing boundaries, embracing change, and seizing global opportunities. That's why we are introducing agile polices, developing world-class infrastructure, and forging partnerships that span the globe.

Global Collaboration: InnoHK's expanding reach

You may have heard of InnoHK, our flagship R&D initiative that fosters global R&D collaboration. Currently, we host 30 labs in partnership with 30 top-notch universities and research institutes from 12 economies under two research clusters focusing on AI and robotics, and health technologies. And today, I am thrilled to share that we are launching a third cluster focusing on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing, and materials. France, with your leadership in green energy, is the natural partner. I am confident that, together, we can turn research into real-world impact.

AI: Powering the next frontier and the future

AI is spearheading a new wave of technological revolution and industrial transformation. It is not just the future, it is happening right now. Hong Kong is all in. The solid R&D capabilities and world class talent we have are the best asset supporting our city's AI aspiration. Five of our universities rank among the world's top 50 for data science and AI, positioning Hong Kong as a leading AI hub in Asia.

Our robust AI infrastructure, including the AI Supercomputing Centre which opened last year and the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute to be established, provides solid support to the industry on AI-related research and application. Furthermore, a $10 billion Hong Kong dollars-worth Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund, equivalent to around 1.1 billion euros, will be there to channel more market capital to turbocharge strategic industries, with AI at the core. We are not just adopting AI, but we are investing in shaping the future.

Hong Kong: A gateway for global enterprises

To bolster downstream industry development, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been actively attracting I&T enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. For example, companies like BeyonCa, a premium electric vehicle start-up backed by the Renault Group and Dongfeng Motor Group, has chosen Hong Kong for its international headquarters and final assembly plant. This decision is a testament to Hong Kong's strategic location, favourable business environment, and growing potential in advanced manufacturing. It also exemplifies Hong Kong's important role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world, serving as a two-way springboard for attracting overseas enterprises and helping Mainland enterprises to ""go global"".

Hong Kong's next chapter: shaping the future together

Ladies and gentlemen, innovation is not about incremental steps - it is about leaps. At the Hong Kong Tech Pavilion in Hall 1, you will see 20 pioneering start-ups from our two I&T flagships - Hong Kong Science Park and Hong Kong Cyberport proving just that. From AI to life and health tech, they are redefining what is possible.

Before I close, let me leave you with words from Lei Jun (é·è»), who transformed Xiaomi into a global tech leader: ""Dream big, start small, and act fast. The speed of execution is everything in innovation."" To every innovators and entrepreneurs here: whether you are from France or beyond, your next big idea deserves a launchpad that moves as fast as you do. Let's make it happen in Hong Kong!

Thank you. Merci."
禁毒綜藝電視節目　回顧60年禁毒歷史　展望無毒香港（附圖／短片）,2025-06-13 23:04,2025-06-13 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300353.htm,"禁毒常務委員會（禁常會）呈獻的大型禁毒綜藝電視節目《一齊企硬．唔Take嘢》今日（六月十三日）晚上在將軍澳電視廣播城舉行。政務司司長陳國基在節目上致辭，並聯同保安局局長鄧炳強、禁常會主席李國棟醫生、保安局副局長卓孝業等為節目主禮，為一連串精彩禁毒表演揭開序幕。

陳國基致辭時表示，在上世紀六十年代，香港深受毒品問題困擾。自禁常會成立以來，一直匯聚政府和社會各界力量同心抗毒。從一九七七年有記錄以來至二○二四年，被呈報吸毒者總人數跌幅高達七成。而去年涉及嚴重毒品案而被捕的21歲以下青少年人數，創下有記錄以來的新低。香港的禁毒工作取得驕人成就，禁常會功不可沒。

他說：「今年是禁毒常務委員會成立60周年，我很高興能夠在這個重要時刻，參與今日的節目，和大家一起回顧本港禁毒工作的發展……我代表特區政府向所有曾參與禁毒工作的人士，致以衷心的謝意……我呼籲各位市民幫忙宣揚『一齊企硬 唔Take嘢！』的決心，一同攜手邁向無毒未來，守護好每一位市民的健康。」

在開幕禮上，陳國基帶領一眾主禮嘉賓啓動裝置，七款象徵不同毒品的道具隨即掉進一象徵銷毀裝置的機關，代表害人不淺的毒品皆被銷毀。陳國基帶領一眾主禮嘉賓宣讀禁毒口號「一齊企硬 唔Take嘢！」，起動一連串的精彩禁毒表演。

李國棟醫生通過錄影短片為節目致辭時表示，香港的禁毒工作取得進展，實在有賴全港市民積極參與，60年來幾代人齊心嚴厲打擊毒品。他感謝各位前人對禁毒工作作出的貢獻。他又說：「我邀請電視機前的你，繼續踴躍參與禁毒工作。我相信有你們的參與，無毒香港，指日可待。」

於節目上，一眾青春偶像及歌手獻唱正向歌曲，包括禁毒主題曲《青春作風》，以輕快的節奏帶出正能量，鼓勵年輕人堅守正向人生觀。

香港海關的「香港海關青年發展計劃」成員於一歌唱環節中，演奏豎琴及表演舞蹈，透過古典音樂及現代舞的衝擊，帶出正向興趣不但能擴闊視野、展現才能，更能鞏固禁毒決心。

香港警務處的「禁毒領袖學院」成員表演花式跳繩和富活力的嘻哈舞蹈，告訴觀眾透過運動鍛煉出強健體魄和堅毅意志，是抵抗毒品誘惑的其中一個最佳途徑。武術運動員莫宛螢及乒乓球運動員黃鎮廷亦分別於此環節中，以他們的拿手好戲——剛柔並濟的武術（套路）和以速度見稱的乒乓球球藝，為年輕人打氣。

懲教署的「更生先鋒領袖」成員，以街頭音樂表演模式，彈奏夏威夷小吉他、電子琴及吉他，希望藉此引起年輕人共鳴，並希望透過演奏的歌曲表達，健康的精神狀態是遠離毒品的必要元素。

另外，節目亦安排藝人演出以成功戒毒人士經歷改編而成的短劇，並由該戒毒人士參與演出。

節目由禁常會及保安局禁毒處合辦、電視廣播有限公司製作，以回顧香港60年來的禁毒歷史，並凝聚社會力量，共同打擊毒禍，展望無毒香港。節目有來自不同界別，包括學生、青少年團體、教育及社福等代表參與。此節目為禁常會成立60周年紀念活動之一。

節目將於六月二十一日晚上九時在無綫電視翡翠台播出，歡迎市民收看，一起傳遞禁毒信息，共同建設無毒香港。"
Anti-drug variety TV programme reviews 60 years of anti-drug history envisioning drug-free Hong Kong (with photos/video),2025-06-13 23:04,2025-06-13 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300474.htm,"  The large-scale anti-drug variety TV programme ""Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!"" presented by the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) was held at TVB City in Tseung Kwan O this evening (June 13). The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, delivered a speech at the programme and officiated at the kick-off ceremony of a series of spectacular anti-drug performances along with the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Chairman of ACAN, Dr Donald Li; the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk, and other guests.

  Mr Chan said in his speech that Hong Kong was previously plagued by drug problems in the 1960s. Since the establishment of ACAN, the Government and various sectors of the community have been working together to combat drug problems. From 1977, when records started to be kept, to 2024, the total number of reported drug abusers has dropped by as much as 70 per cent. Last year, the number of young people under the age of 21 arrested for serious drug offences was at a record low. ACAN has been instrumental in the success of Hong Kong's anti-drug efforts.

  He said, ""This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Action Committee Against Narcotics. I am glad to be able to take part in the programme today and review with everyone the development of the anti-drug efforts in Hong Kong on this important occasion...On behalf of the HKSAR Government, I would like to express heartfelt gratitude to all those who have participated in the anti-drug cause...I would like to appeal to all members of the public to help spread the steadfast message of 'Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!' and work together towards a drug-free future to safeguard the health of every member of the public.""

  At the opening ceremony, Mr Chan led the officiating guests in activating a device, after which seven props symbolising different drugs were dropped into a machine symbolising the destruction of pernicious drugs. Mr Chan led the officiating guests to read out the anti-drug slogan ""Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!"" to launch a series of spectacular anti-drug performances.

  Delivering a speech through a recorded short video for the programme, Dr Li said that the progress of Hong Kong's anti-drug efforts owed a lot to the active participation of members of the public in Hong Kong and the concerted efforts of several generations in the fight against drugs over the past 60 years. He thanked everyone who had participated in anti-drug work before for their contributions. ""I invite you, in front of the TV, to continue to participate actively in the anti-drug efforts. I believe that with your participation, a drug-free Hong Kong is just around the corner,"" he added.

  In the programme, various young idols and singers performed songs with positive messages, including an upbeat anti-drug theme song that shares with young people positive energy and encourages them to hold dear to positive values in life.

  Members of Hong Kong Customs' ""Customs YES"" played the harp and danced in a musical segment. Through the impact of classical music and modern dance, a message was conveyed that positive hobbies not only broaden one's horizons and let one's talents shine, but also strengthen one's determination against drugs.

  Members of the Hong Kong Police Force's ""Leadership Institute on Narcotics"" performed rope skipping and hip hop dance with energetic vibes, letting the audience know that one of the best ways to resist the temptation of drugs is to build a strong body and a determined mind through sports. Wushu athlete Juanita Mok and table tennis athlete Wong Chun-ting also cheered for youngsters in this segment with their respective fortes - Wushu (Taolu) that combines strength and flexibility, and table tennis, which is known for its speed.

  Members of the Correctional Services Department's ""Rehabilitation Pioneer Leaders"" performed in the form of busking with ukulele, electric piano and guitars, in the hope of striking a chord with young people and expressing through the songs that a healthy state of mind is essential for staying away from drugs.

  In addition, the programme has arranged for artists to re-enact short plays based on the true stories of rehabilitees who have successfully quit drugs. The rehabilitees have participated in the plays themselves.

  Co-organised by the Narcotics Division of the Security Bureau and ACAN, and produced by Television Broadcasts Limited, the programme aims to review Hong Kong's anti-drug history over the past 60 years and rally community support for combating drug problems. Audience members from different sectors, including students, youth groups and representatives from the education and social welfare sectors, attended the programme. This programme is one of the eventsheld in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of ACAN.

  The programme will be broadcast on TVB Jade at 9pm on June 21. Members of the public are welcome to watch and disseminate anti-drug messages for building a drug-free Hong Kong together."
"Two property owners fined over $110,000 in total for carrying out unauthorised building works",2025-06-13 22:42,2025-06-13 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061301064.htm,"âTwo owners of detached houses on Redhill Peninsula pleaded guilty at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts yesterday (June 12) for carrying out unauthorised building works (UBWs), contravening section 14(1) of the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123) (BO), namely, knowingly carrying out building works without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD). They were fined over $110,000 in total by the court.

The BD discovered certain UBWs at the two detached houses during a large-scale operation in September 2023 to inspect houses along the coastal area of Redhill Peninsula. Investigation by the BD found that the owners of the two houses had knowingly carried out the concerned building works without the prior approval and consent from the BD, contravening section 14(1) of the BO. Hence, the BD instigated prosecution action against the two owners under section 40(1AA) of the BO in August last year. The two owners were convicted and fined $30,000 and $82,980 respectively yesterday.

A spokesman for the BD said today (June 13), ""The Redhill Peninsula incident reveals that coastal detached houses with UBWs or illegal occupation of government land can pose safety hazards and risks to nearby slopes. If such contraventions are discovered, the BD will take vigorous enforcement actions and instigate prosecution actions. Property owners should consult building professionals before carrying out building works to ensure compliance with the BO.""

The spokesperson said that these are the first two convictions for contravening section 14(1) of the BO in relation to the Redhill Peninsula incident. The BD has already instigated prosecutions against 30 detached houses on Redhill Peninsula, including the above two houses. Court hearings for these cases are being rolled out.

Pursuant to section 40(1AA) of the BO, any person who knowingly contravenes section 14(1) (i.e. commencement or carrying out any building works without having first obtained approval and consent from the BD), commits an offence and is liable upon conviction to a fine of $400,000 and to imprisonment for two years, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues.

The Government has earlier on put forward proposals to amend the BO, including increasing the penalties to enhance deterrence against failure to comply with statutory notices or orders by the specified time and offences against serious UBWs. The Government is drafting the legislative amendments, with a view to submitting the amendment bill to the Legislative Council in the first half of 2026."
Ice cream sample detected with coliform bacteria count exceeding legal limit,2025-06-13 22:34,2025-06-13 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061301075.htm,"âThe Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (June 13) that a sample of locally manufactured pistachio-flavoured ice-cream was found to contain coliform bacteria and its count exceeding the legal limit. The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a licensed frozen confection factory in Sha Tin for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 260 coliform bacteria per gram, exceeding the legal limit.""

""The CFS has informed the frozen confection factory concerned of the irregularity and instructed it to stop selling and to dispose all the affected ice-cream immediately. The CFS has also provided health education on food safety and hygiene to the staff of the frozen confection factory, who have also been requested to carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises,"" the spokesman said.

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. An investigation is ongoing."
