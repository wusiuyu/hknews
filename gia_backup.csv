Vaccination and screening are both essential for preventing cervical cancer and can't be missed,2026-01-20 21:05,2026-01-20 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000780.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 20) reminded all female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination to promptly receive free HPV vaccination at designated venues. Besides, women aged 25 to 64 who have had sexual experience should undergo regular cervical screenings. Through ""early prevention, early detection and early treatment"", they can reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer, which is one of the 10 most common cancers and a leading cause of cancer deaths among women in Hong Kong.

HPV vaccination
----------------------

""HPV vaccination is among the most effective measures for cervical cancer prevention, especially for females who have never been exposed to HPV infection, i.e. before their first sexual encounter. Since the 2019/20 school year, the DH has been providing free HPV vaccinations to eligible Primary schoolgirls under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, and a high vaccination rate of over 90 per cent has been maintained in recent years. This significantly lowers the risk of cervical cancer in Hong Kong females,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

The DH launched a one-off HPV Vaccination Catch-up Programme (Catch-up Programme) in December 2024, offering free catch-up vaccinations to female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their HPV vaccination. Under the Catch-up Programme, each eligible person can receive two doses of free vaccination, while immunocompromised persons have to receive three doses of vaccination (all three doses are free of charge).

""The Catch-up Programme is implemented in three phases. With the support of secondary schools and post-secondary institutions, the estimated first-dose HPV vaccine coverage rates of eligible secondary schoolgirls and post-secondary institutions female students in the first two phases were 85 per cent and 68 per cent respectively (Note: These figures combine doses administered under the Catch-up Programme and self-arranged vaccinations). The final phrase of the Catch-up Programme has commenced in June last year, targeting female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have completed their studies in Hong Kong. The estimated coverage is about 55 per cent within half a year. Overall, approximately 50 000 doses of vaccine have been administrated so far under the Catch-up Programme. Although the estimated overall coverage across all three phases has exceeded 60 per cent at present, I do not want 'anyone to be left behind'. The CHP has issued a letter to post-secondary institutions again to urge them to assist in encouraging eligible students to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHCC), the CHP has also urged family doctors to assist in encouraging eligible working female to receive HPV vaccination,"" Dr Tsui said.

Female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their HPV vaccination only need to register with eHealth, and can schedule an appointment through thewebsiteor by calling 2855 1333 to receive a free HPV vaccination at Women Wellness Satellites (WWSs) or designated District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses (DHCEs) under the PHCC of the Health Bureau. Females enrolled in local secondary schools or post-secondary institutions can contact their student affairs offices for details.

""The one-off Catch-up Programme lasting approximately for two years offers free HPV vaccination. Details can be found on the DH's website. Eligible female Hong Kong residents who do not participate in the Catch-up Programme will need to pay for vaccinations out-of-pocket in future. The cost of vaccination may exceed $1,200 per dose,"" Dr Tsui remarked.

Cervical screening
-----------------------

""Beyond vaccination, regular screening serves as another line of defence. Most cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV and infection with HPV or early stages of cervical cancer may not have any noticeable symptoms. In 2023, 576 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed, accounting for 3.0 per cent of all new cancer cases in females. Cervical cancer was the seventh most common cancer among females in Hong Kong. In 2024, a total of 160 women died from cervical cancer, accounting for 2.5 per cent of female cancer deaths. Over the past decade, the age-standardised mortality rate for cervical cancer has remained largely stable after adjusting for population age structure, reflecting the achievements of screening and treatment advancements. However, the age-standardised incidence rate of cervical cancer has shown a slight upward trend in recent years, indicating that the threat of cervical cancer to women's health should not be underestimated. Therefore, I urge women aged 25 to 64 who have had sexual experience to undergo regular cervical screening in order to promptly detect and treat early cervical pre-cancerous changes, thereby preventing cervical cancer and improving cure rates,"" Dr Tsui said.

The DH has implemented the Cervical Screening Programme since 2004. Cervical screening services are available at Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) of the DH, WWSs, as well as through non-governmental organisations and private healthcare providers. Common screening methods include HPV testing and/or a cytology examination (also called a cervical smear or pap smear) performed by healthcare professionals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also recommended vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing as another reliable method for cervical screening. The latest Health Behaviour Survey of the DH revealed that about 50 per cent of eligible women had ever had cervical screening. The DH has been working closely with healthcare professionals to enhance the promotion of cervical screening through general education and clinical consultation, and to understand the barriers of the public to accept the screening. To echo WHO's advice, starting in 2024, the DH initiated HPV testing of self-collected samples at 11 MCHCs to study the feasibility and acceptability of vaginal HPV self-sampling locally. Moreover, HPV testing of self-collected samples is planned to be rolled out in WWSs in the first quarter of 2026. Details will be announced later on the WWS'swebsite.

It is important to note that there is currently insufficient scientific evidence in Hong Kong or internationally to support the use of self-collected menstrual blood or urine samples for cervical screenings. The DH will continue to review the latest scientific evidence.

Women who wish to receive a cervical screening at MCHCs can schedule an appointment through the 24-hour hotline at 3166 6631, or contact WWSs via itswebsiteor 18 DHCs/DHCEs (website) for personalised primary healthcare services for women including cervical cancer screening. For further information on cervical cancer and screenings, please visit the DH'swebsite."
CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as three severe paediatric influenza infection cases have been reported within eight days,2026-01-20 19:34,2026-01-20 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000752.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 20) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case, marking the third such case within eight days. Based on historical epidemiological data, Hong Kong usually enters its winter influenza season in January. It cannot be ruled out that influenza activity may rise again in the coming months. The CHP reiterated its reminder to parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly. The SIV remains one of the most effective methods of preventing influenza and its complications and can reduce the risk of serious complications or death from infection.

The case involves a 14-year-old girl. On January 18, she attended a private clinic as she developed a fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough and myalgia. She further presented with dizziness on the following day (January 19) and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital. Due to persistently low blood pressure, she was admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital for treatment. Her respiratory specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. She remains hospitalised, but her condition hasstabilised and her blood pressure has returned to normal.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the girl had received the 2025/26 SIV. Three of her classmates recently developed influenza-like symptoms. One of them was hospitalised and has been discharged, with a respiratory specimen testing positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The other two students presented with mild symptoms and did not require hospitalisation. The CHP advised the school concerned on the necessary infection control measures to be implemented and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance. The 14-year-old girl has four household contacts. Two of them developed mild respiratory symptoms earlier but did not require hospitalisation.

So far this year, three severe paediatric influenza cases have been recorded, involving children aged between 6 months and 14 years old. Two of the affected children had not received SIV, including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only three days before the onset of illness. As the patient was not protected by the vaccine, the case is not counted as being vaccinated. During the summer influenza season ending in early January, 25 severe paediatric influenza cases were recorded, including three fatal cases and involving children aged between 6 months to 17 years old. Among them, 20 cases (80 per cent) had not received an SIV (including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only four days before the onset of illness).

""Influenza activity may rise again as the weather remains cold in the first quarter of this year, and it cannot be ruled out that the circulating virus strains may change as the winter influenza season approaches. Therefore, I once again urge all individuals aged 6 months or older, except those with known contraindications, to act promptly if they have not yet received an SIV. This includes those who contracted influenza during the summer influenza season in order to guard against other circulating virus strains that may emerge during the upcoming winter influenza season. Furthermore, although there are some antigenic differences between the currently circulating influenza A (H3) virus strain and the virus strain contained in the vaccine, scientific research indicates that this season's influenza vaccines can still offer protection against the variant strain of subclade K, as well as the influenza A (H1) and influenza B strains included in the vaccine,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""The number of influenza outbreaks in schools has increased since classes resumed after the holidays. For children who did not join the SIV School Outreach Programme, parents should promptly bring their children toprivate doctorsenrolled in the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme to receive an SIV. In addition, the SIV coverage rate for children aged 6 months to under 2 years is only about 23 per cent. Although this represents an approximate 4 percentage point increase compared to the same period last year, it is still much lower than that of other age groups. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to allow their children to receive an SIV,"" Dr Tsui added.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially for children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, they should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
預防子宮頸癌　疫苗和篩查一個不能少,2026-01-20 19:27,2026-01-20 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000731.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十日）提醒所有在二○○四年至二○○八年出生而未完成接種人類乳頭瘤病毒（HPV）疫苗的女性香港居民盡快到指定地點免費接種疫苗。另外，25至64歲曾有性經驗的婦女亦應定期進行子宮頸篩查，透過「早預防、早發現、早治療」，遠離本港女性十大常見及致命癌症——子宮頸癌的威脅。

HPV疫苗
————

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「接種HPV疫苗是預防子宮頸癌最有效的措施之一，尤其在婦女未感染病毒前（即未有性行為前），疫苗能發揮最佳效能。自二○一九／二○學年起，衞生署在香港兒童免疫接種計劃下，為合資格的小學女童免費接種HPV疫苗，過去幾年一直維持超過九成的極高接種率，大大減低香港女性患上子宮頸癌的機會。」

衞生署於二○二四年十二月開展一次性HPV疫苗補種計劃（補種計劃），為二○○四年至二○○八年出生、尚未完成接種HPV疫苗的女性香港居民提供免費補種。補種計劃下，每名合資格人士可免費接種兩劑疫苗，而免疫力弱的人士則需接種三劑（三劑均為免費）。

徐樂堅醫生說：「補種計劃分三個階段推行，首兩個階段在各中學及專上院校的支持下，合資格的全日制中學女生及專上院校女生的第一劑HPV疫苗覆蓋率分別估算為85%和68%（註：綜合計算參與補種計劃和已經自行安排接種的人士）。補種計劃最後階段已經於去年六月展開，對象為二○○四年至二○○八年出生而已經完成本地學業的女性香港居民，半年間的疫苗覆蓋率初步估算已達55%。整體而言，補種計劃至今已接種約五萬劑疫苗，雖然三個階段的估算整體覆蓋率暫時已超過六成，但我不希望『任何人掉隊』。中心已再次去信各專上院校，促請他們協助鼓勵合資格學生盡快接種疫苗。中心亦已透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵合資格在職婦女接種HPV疫苗。」

二○○四年至二○○八年出生的女性香港居民若未完成接種HPV疫苗只需先登記「醫健通」，便可透過網頁或致電2855 1333預約於醫務衞生局基層醫療署轄下的樂妍站或指定地區康健中心／站免費接種HPV疫苗；就讀本港中學或專上院校之女生則可向校內事務處查詢。

徐樂堅醫生強調：「補種計劃屬一次性特別安排，為期約兩年，費用全免，詳情可瀏覽衞生署網頁。不參與補種計劃的合資格女性香港居民日後需要自費接種，疫苗接種費用每劑可能超過1,200元。」

子宮頸篩查
—————

徐樂堅醫生說：「除了疫苗，定期篩查防治是另一重防線。大部分子宮頸癌由持續感染高風險的HPV引致，HPV感染或早期子宮頸癌可能沒有任何明顯症狀，在二○二三年，共有576宗新確診子宮頸癌病例，佔女性癌症新症總數的3.0%，在女性癌症中排第七位。而在二○二四年，共有160名女性死於子宮頸癌，佔女性癌症死亡人數的2.5%。在過去10年，剔除人口年齡結構因素後，子宮頸癌的年齡標準化死亡率大致平穩，反映篩查與治療進展的成果。然而子宮頸癌的年齡標準化發病率近年呈現輕微上升趨勢，顯示子宮頸癌對女性健康的威脅不容輕視。因此，我提醒25至64歲曾有性經驗的婦女應定期進行子宮頸篩查，及早發現和治療早期的子宮頸細胞癌前病變，以預防子宮頸癌及提升治癒率。」

衞生署自二○○四年起推行子宮頸普查計劃。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、樂妍站、非政府機構及私營醫護服務提供者都有提供子宮頸篩查服務。常見的子宮頸篩查方法包括以醫護人員採集的子宮頸樣本進行HPV檢測及／或子宮頸細胞檢驗（又稱子宮頸抹片或柏氏抹片）。世界衞生組織（世衞）亦建議透過自行採集陰道樣本進行HPV檢測為子宮頸篩查的另一可靠方法。衞生署最新的健康行為調查結果顯示，約50%合資格婦女曾進行子宮頸篩查。衞生署一直與醫護人員緊密合作，透過教育及臨床診治，加強推廣子宮頸篩查，並了解市民在接受篩查方面遇到的障礙。為響應世衞呼籲，自二○二四年起，11間母嬰健康院進行HPV自行採樣檢測先導計劃及研究，探討陰道HPV自行採樣的可行性和接受程度。此外，樂妍站計劃在二○二六年第一季推出HPV自行採樣檢測計劃，詳情將稍後於樂妍站網頁公布。

值得留意的是，本港乃至國際間目前尚未有充分科學證據支持使用自行採集經血或尿液樣本作子宮頸篩查。衞生署會持續檢視最新科學實證。

婦女如計劃在母嬰健康院進行子宮頸篩查，可透過24小時熱線3166 6631預約，或聯絡樂妍站（網頁）或十八區地區康健中心／站（網頁）預約包括子宮頸癌篩查在內的個人化女性基層醫療服務。更多有關子宮頸癌和篩查的資訊，請瀏覽衞生署網頁。"
八日內第三宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2026-01-20 18:40,2026-01-20 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000684.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，是八日內第三宗。根據以往流行病學資料，香港多在一月踏入冬季流感季節，不排除流感活躍程度在未來數月會再度上升。中心再次提醒家長應盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗。接種流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名14歲女童。她於一月十八日出現發燒、流涕、咽喉痛、咳嗽和肌肉痛，同日到私家診所求診，翌日（一月十九日）出現頭暈，並到基督教聯合醫院急症室求醫，由於病人血壓持續偏低，遂被安排入住深切治療部接受治療。她的呼吸道樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應。她目前仍然留院，情況已轉趨穩定，而血壓已回復正常。

初步調查顯示，該女童已接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗，她的三名同班同學近日出現流感樣病徵，其中一人曾入院並已出院，其呼吸道樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，另外二人病況輕微，無需入院。中心已建議校方實施感染控制措施，並會對該校進行醫學監察。她有四名家居接觸者，其中兩人早前均出現輕微呼吸道感染症狀，無需住院。

今年至今已錄得三宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至14歲，其中兩宗沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前三天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗，由於患者未能受到疫苗保護，因此個案被視為未接種疫苗）。而在一月初結束的夏季流感季節，共錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。當中，20宗（80%）個案沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前四天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「隨着天氣在今年首季維持寒冷，而流行病毒株亦不排除會發生改變，流感活躍程度可能會再度上升，冬季流感季節即將到臨。因此，我再次呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗，應從速行動，包括在夏季流感季節曾感染流感的人士，以預防未來的冬季流感季節可能出現其他流行病毒株。此外，雖然目前流行的甲型（H3）流感病毒與疫苗所含的病毒株存在一些抗原差異，但科學研究顯示本季使用的季節性流感疫苗仍能對亞分支K的變異病毒株，以及疫苗中包含的甲型（H1）及乙型流感病毒提供保護。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「學校的流感爆發在假期復課後有所增加。如果學童沒有參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，家長應盡快帶子女到參加疫苗資助計劃的私家醫生接種季節性流感疫苗。此外，六個月至未滿兩歲的幼兒的季節性流感疫苗接種率只有約23%，雖然較上一季度同期上升約四個百分點，但仍遠低於其他年齡組別的接種率。中心已經透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵家長讓子女接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

Semi-urgent and non-urgent cases drop significantly by 20 per cent; Accident and Emergency Departments focus resources on critical and emergency care,2026-01-20 17:42,2026-01-20 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026011900629.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson announced today (January 20) that since the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, there has been an overall decrease in the number of attendances at Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) of public hospitals, with a significant drop in semi-urgent and non-urgent cases. The average waiting time for urgent patients to receive treatment has also decreased, indicating that resources are more effectively focused on critical and emergency care, resulting in improved efficiency in treating emergency patients.

  From January 1 to 18, 85 676 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA, representing a significant decrease of nearly 15 per cent compared to the same period last year. Among the cases, 4 889 patients were triaged as critical and emergency cases, showing an increase of 7.7 per cent compared to the same period last year. Thirty-eight thousand one hundred fifty-five patients were classified as urgent cases, representing a decrease of 8.4 per cent year on year. The remaining 42 632 patients were classified as semi-urgent and non-urgent cases, marking a substantial decrease of 21.3 per cent compared to the same period last year. The latest A&E statistics are analysed as follows:


Significant decrease in average daily A&E attendances by 14.6 per cent;
About 4 900 critical and emergency patients exempted from A&E fees under the new fees and charges reform. These patients were required to pay the fees before the reform;
For patients classified as urgent cases, the percentage of those being treated within 30 minutes - meeting the service pledge target - increased from 82.7 per centlast year to 87.1 per cent, with the average waiting time reduced from 22 to 20 minutes;
Among the five triage categories, the proportion of semi-urgent and non-urgent patients decreased from 54.2 per centlast year to 49.8 per cent; and
The average waiting time for semi-urgent and non-urgent patients decreased from 144 minutes last year to 111 minutes.


The Chairman of the HA Coordinating Committee in A&E, Dr Axel Siu,said, ""The latest statistics of A&Es, including attendance numbers, semi-urgent and non-urgent cases, and treatment efficiency for urgent patients, all indicate that resources of A&Es are now better directed towards critical and emergency patients. Non-urgent patients or patients with other medical needs are changingto seek more appropriate healthcare services other than A&Es, achieving the original intention of the public healthcare fees and charges reform. A&Es can better concentrate resources and treat patients with urgent medical needs more effectively. We are very pleased to see that the reform has successfully achieved its positive and intended outcomes.""

Dr Siu reiterated that A&E is positioned to serve critical, emergency and urgent patients. Individuals with minor conditions or episodic illnesses, such as common colds, are encouraged to visit Family Medicine Clinics, private doctors, or 24-hour outpatient services of private hospitals. Following the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the HA has regularised the A&E refund arrangements, which can facilitate less urgent patients in opting to other healthcare institutions after triage. From January 1 to 18 this year, a total of 952 A&E patients applied for refund.

The HA will continue to closely monitor the operations of A&E to ensure that resources are focused on patients with urgent medical needs, in line with the objectives of the public healthcare fees and charges reform to strengthen support for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients."
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-20 17:30,2026-01-20 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000616.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 20), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
HAD opens temporary cold shelters,2026-01-20 17:30,2026-01-20 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000622.htm,"​  In view of the cold weather, the Home Affairs Department has opened 18 temporary cold shelters in various districts today (January 20) for people in need of the service. The temporary shelters will remain open when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

  Clean mattresses and blankets/quilts, hot meals and hot water will be provided to shelter users free of charge during the opening of the temporary shelters.

To ensure that cold shelter users can rest in a quiet and undisturbed environment, members of the public or agencies wishing to make donations to shelter users are requested to register with the staff of the shelter first. Donors will then be directed to place the donated items at a specified indoor location. The staff will help notify the shelter users to collect the items on their own.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-20 17:30,2026-01-20 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000602.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月二十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
​
市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
急症室次緊急及非緊急病人顯著下跌兩成　集中資源救急扶危,2026-01-20 17:30,2026-01-20 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026011900628.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（一月二十日）表示，公營醫療收費改革實施以來，公立醫院急症室整體求診人次有所減少，次緊急及非緊急病人數目下跌顯著。而緊急病人接受治療的平均等候時間亦有所下降，反映資源更集中於救急扶危，急症病人救治效率提升。

今年一月一日至十八日，共有85 676名病人前往醫管局轄下18間急症室就診，較去年同期顯著減少近一成半，其中4 889名病人分流類別為危殆及危急，較去年同期上升7.7%；38 155名病人分流為緊急，較去年同期下跌8.4%，次緊急及非緊急則為42 632人，較去年同期大減超過兩成達21.3%。急症室最新數據分析如下︰


急症室每日平均求診人次顯著減少14.6%；
約4 900名分流類別為危殆及危急的病人在新收費機制下獲豁免急症室收費。而在收費改革前，此類病人需要繳費；
分流類別為緊急的病人於30分鐘內就診，達致服務承諾指標的比率由去年82.7%增加至87.1%，而平均等候時間亦由22分鐘縮短至20分鐘；
五類分流類別中，次緊急及非緊急病人佔比由去年54.2%減少至49.8%；及
次緊急及非緊急病人平均等候時間由去年144分鐘減少至111分鐘。


醫管局急症科統籌委員會主席蕭粵中醫生表示︰「急症室的最新數據，包括求診人數、次緊急及非緊急病人數目，以及緊急病人診治效率，均反映急症室的資源更能導向於處理危急病人，非緊急或有其他醫療需要的病人亦會尋求急症室以外更合適的醫療服務，達致公營醫療收費改革的初衷，將資源集中及有效治療有緊急醫療需要的病人，我們十分樂見改革成功達到正面及預期的效果。」

蕭粵中醫生重申，急症室的定位在於服務危殆、危急及緊急病人，病情較輕或患上偶發性疾病，例如普通傷風感冒，相關人士應該盡量前往家庭醫學診所、私家醫生或私家醫院24小時門診就診。醫管局在公營醫療收費改革實施後，將急症室退款機制恆常化，亦有助非緊急病人在分流後選擇轉往其他醫療機構就診。今年一月一日至十八日，共有952名急症室病人申請退款。

醫管局會繼續密切監察急症室的運作情況，確保急症室集中資源照顧有緊急醫療需要的病人，以達致公營醫療收費改革中，加強保障貧、急、重、危病人的宗旨。"

財庫局局長及公務員事務局局長就檢討政府採購機制專責小組報告和相關紀律調查結果會見傳媒談話內容（附短片）,2026-01-20 17:22,2026-01-20 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000637.htm,"​以下為財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇及公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（一月二十日）就檢討政府採購機制專責小組報告和就採購樽裝飲用水事件進行的紀律調查結果會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：想問陳嘉信，既然其他政府物流服務署（物流署）官員會被停止發放增薪點，為何他退休後不會有削弱其退休金這些懲處方式，而只是撤回他的勳章﹖第二，中央投標委員會主席黎志華，以及代政府簽標書、已經退休的採購總監曾昭奇，這些官員會否都問責？

公務員事務局局長：首先，我想解釋一下，我們是根據調查組得出來的事實去判定不同的同事要負的責任。我們說問責不是憑空講，第一要基於事實，第二都要合度，即是合乎事實反映出來該事件的比例。我們剛才都解釋了，調查組發現有三位物流署人員未能夠及時去識別一些好明顯的不妥之處、一些詐騙的跡象，令部門錯過及時去反應的時機。前署長是因為同事沒有上報，所以他在事件上是沒有辦法知道有這些跡象出現，因此調查組沒有發現前署長有疏忽的地方。但因為同事的能力有所欠缺，以及見到有一個普遍性，對於署長工作的這個範疇——提升同事工作能力這方面，我們覺得是有不足，因此去信給他。另外，授勳及非官守太平紳士遴選委員會亦考慮了所有事實，作出了這個建議。

至於其他同事，對於物流署三位同事是哪三位，我就不會在此透露他們的身分，我亦不會回應任何關於他們身分的猜測，因為我們對於同事，在處理他們的紀律處分等，都要顧及他們的私隱。至於在物流署以外，調查組沒有發現其他公務員有疏忽的情況。

記者：首先想弄清楚，剛才局長提到幾位前物流署人員，這一刻他們會繼續在部門工作還是已經離開物流署？他們在調查期間的工作狀態是怎樣？如果確認他們表現極度不理想，特別是那位首長級人員，之後會否再有其他懲處？第二，有報道指今次調查報告（完成）之後曾經諮詢過DOJ（律政司），有否諮詢過DOJ？當中有否涉及刑事成分而有研究過可能要追討﹖

公務員事務局局長：我剛才提到的是前物流署署長，該幾位人員並不是前物流署同事，他們都是物流署的同事。他們在調查期間都需要工作，有一些正在放假就在放假（不是因為調查而放假），有一些工作的就繼續工作。我剛才提到我們會就三位人員的其中兩位進行正式的紀律行動，會是一個獨立的研訊，對於政府就他們的指控會有一個結果。我們會根據結果決定如何懲處，這是一般正式紀律行動的過程。

我們諮詢律政司就是因為要做正式的紀律行動。我們在每一個正式的紀律行動個案，指控都需要比較精準，不可以籠統地說，所以就每一個個案，若要做正式的紀律行動，我們都會諮詢律政司。這次諮詢律政司都是同一個原因。

記者：三位人員在採購程序中分別扮演甚麼角色？今次發現署方問題有普遍性，其實問題的普遍性即是怎樣﹖即是採購程序不小心或者未能夠識破虛假文書的情況都有出現，其他程序是否都有這個情況，大眾是否需要擔心？

財經事務及庫務局局長：正如剛才楊局長所說，今次調查揭示了一個比較核心的內容，就是發現同事在一些關鍵時點，針對一些關鍵事實，沒有很及時地上報。由此得出的結論是，某程度上，同事作為採購把關者，相關的經驗和標準是未能達到，因而才有楊太（公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵）剛才所說的相應安排。

公務員事務局局長：普遍性不是說有很多應該能識別出來的不妥之處卻識別不到，而是同事在這件事上的表現欠缺警覺性、欠缺判斷力和欠缺分析能力。因為不同職級的同事都有這樣的表現，我們覺得在部門內，這不是個別人士的問題，而是顯示有一個普遍性。

記者：其實今次事件只是三位人員已經導致到大部分政府部門使用不是合法來源的樽裝水，會否認為之後類似事件應該由多些人負責，可不可以只是歸咎於不小心？是不是制度上都有一些漏洞？剛才只是提及四個方向，具體上應該怎樣改善？

公務員事務局局長：我首先回答部分問題。在整個事件中，我重申調查組是非常深入、非常全面地找出所有相關事實，然後我們根據這些事實，對不同人應該要負的責任作了一個判斷。最後，我們發現需要負責的或者有疏漏、有疏忽的就是三位同事，我看不到為甚麼需要牽涉多些人，因為需要負責的同事就需要負責，而在整個過程中，這些同事不是因為有太多工作以致未能顧及。所以，日後要負責做這些工作的都是同樣人數，同樣職級的同事，不過他們在警覺性、分析能力和判斷力方面要有所進步。

財經事務及庫務局局長：你剛才提到的制度問題正是我領導的制度檢討小組（檢討政府採購機制專責小組）的主要內容和目標。我們現在做的一系列優化措施，包括我在十月時說過的，現在已經落實了絕大部分。我們希望做到全流程，進行招標評估前，在合約管理和事後處理方面，都能夠提升我們採購的能力。牽涉採購貨品的安排，我們是貨到才付款的。所以我們對一些可能滿足不到財務要求的供應商，我們只要求他們繳交更高的保證金——百分之五或六，仍然是接受他們（入標）的。但我們現在很清晰，若是超過1,500萬元的貨品合約，我們同樣要求做財務審查，這是第一。第二方面是聚焦樽裝水的安排，我們過去是容許貿易公司入標的，但今次（招標）很清楚，必須是飲用水製造商，我們才容許（它入標）。由於水本身是一個比較簡單、明瞭、清晰的產品，我們沒有必要一個中介或者貿易商做相關的招標工作。

記者﹕報告顯示時任物流署署長沒有疏忽，因為下級沒有上報，其實超過5,000萬元（的採購）都無需部門首長知道，其實要怎樣才可以向首長呈報知道﹖另外，物流署人員在事件中的表現都未達到與其職級和經驗相稱的水平，反映有普遍性，作為署長都看不到這個普遍性其實是否失職，剛剛說他其實沒有疏忽，但為何又要撤回他的銀紫荊星章？

公務員事務局局長：首先，我想解釋在調查過程中有就署長對部門管理、對部門發生的事的掌握等制度有進行調查，發現部門內存在足夠的監管、匯報等制度。我們在調查過程中亦詢問了前署長下級的同事，他們亦表達署長是非常歡迎同事向他匯報任何事情。機制存在，亦不是不讓同事匯報，但無奈是同事根本識別不到該事件是應該需要匯報，即是說機制雖然存在，署長歡迎同事匯報，但同事識別不到該事件是需要匯報而沒有向上級報告。所以這件事的核心，是同事缺乏與他們的職級和經驗應有的警覺、判斷力和分析能力，這才是關鍵，並非沒有這些制度存在，或者署長不接受同事的匯報等。

談到署長有沒有責任，我剛才已解釋，在部門中有幾個不同職級的同事都顯示在這些工作能力方面有欠缺，看到一個普遍性，所以署長在任時於部門辨識同事的強弱項，以及針對他們的弱項多做培訓、多做輔導，應該更加有作為，這部分是可以做得更加多，所以我們發信給他。一般來說，同事在工作某方面，若我們覺得有些欠缺、應該有進步，我們都會這樣做。

第二是你提到的撤回勳章，撤回勳章本身不是一個罰則，勳章制度本身是一個嘉獎的制度，今次是撤回予他的一個獎勵，不是一個懲罰，我希望大家分清楚兩個方面。

記者：前署長陳嘉信先生有否就相關的裁定結果向當局有甚麼解釋，或者提出申訴？

公務員事務局局長：我們對於任何同事，如果向他表達了一些看法，他可以向我們作申述，我們亦會聆聽他的申述。如果有新的觀點，我們會考慮。如果我們是書面給他，或是同事要求，甚至我們不是書面，而是口頭給予同事一些意見或看法，同事有回饋給我們，或他有要求，我們都會放在人事檔案。如果我們以書面給他，他書面回給我們，我們都會放在人事檔案。至於事件中的個別同事，因與他的私隱有關，是他自己的事情，所以我不便透露。

記者：有兩條問題。剛才說有疏忽的首長級人員是誰？劉女士的調查報告會不會公開﹖第二條問題是如果陳嘉信不是碰巧退休的話，其實他的銀紫荊星章，即是否他沒有被處分？如果有的話，處分是甚麼﹖

公務員事務局局長：我重申不會就任何問及紀律懲處中的人員身分，或者對身分的一些猜測作回應的，因為我們需要保障同事的私隱，而個人資料私隱專員公署亦有明確守則，我們作為僱主需要遵守的，這是第一點。第二，陳先生現在還未退休，是退休前休假，我們今次對他的做法完全與他是否退休是沒有關係的。即使是一個在任的同事，我們是基於事實得出結論，都會有同樣的做法。

SFST and SCS speak on report of Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and outcome of relevant disciplinary investigation (with video),2026-01-20 17:22,2026-01-20 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000638.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, and the Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, at a media session on the report of the Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and outcome of the disciplinary investigation of the procurement of bottled drinking water incident this morning (January 20):

Reporter:Why did the accountability buck stop at the Government Logistics Department? Why is the Government satisfied that there was no further oversight from bureau level? And what mechanism besides the preliminary suggestions raised before by the Government imposed to prevent similar oversight from happening again?

Secretary for the Civil Service: Our investigation has been thorough and has been comprehensive, and it has revealed a lot of facts. Our decisions are all made based on the facts. Our decisions in conducting disciplinary actions against certain officers, in reflecting their performances in their performance appraisals and so on, have to be commensurate with the shortcomings revealed in the investigation report. So, everything is based on facts and we'll seek to take actions that are commensurate with the responsibilities of the officers concerned.

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: In response to your question about what we have done to improve the regulatory regime, or the overall regime of the Government in procurement, I think it is exactly the purpose that we have set out to do when I led the Task Force to look at: what are the areas that we can do further? Along those lines, we have already identified four areas, including in terms of the mechanism to deal with the assessment and the contract management of tendering; and to look into the technology to make sure that there will be a wider circulation of information within the Government in case of any issues that we want to highlight to other procuring departments. At the same time, a lot of these measures have been implemented. For example, in the current re-tendering of our bottled water exercise, we have already implemented those measures. So, in conclusion, I would say that we have already identified the issues, and we have put them into practice and will continue to do so.

Reporter: First, I would like to see if Mrs Yeung could explain a bit more, in terms of why did the Government decide to revoke the former Government Logistics Department head Mr Carlson Chan's honours, and how appropriate or sufficient do you think it is to reflect the severity of the case?

Secretary for the Civil Service: I think this procurement of drinking water incident has drawn extensive attention from the public and brought serious disrepute to the Government. In this light, after consulting the Honours and Non-official Justices of the Peace Selection Committee, the Government has decided to reverse the previously announced decision to award the Silver Bauhinia Star to Mr Chan, and Mr Chan has been informed. This is after consideration of the investigation result and all the facts revealed.

二零二五年十月至十二月失業及就業不足統計數字,2026-01-20 16:30,2026-01-20 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000483.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（一月二十日）發表的最新勞動人口統計數字（即二零二五年十月至十二月的臨時數字），二零二五年十月至十二月經季節性調整的失業率為3.8%，與二零二五年九月至十一月的數字相同。就業不足率則由二零二五年九月至十一月的1.6%上升至二零二五年十月至十二月的1.7%。

與二零二五年九月至十一月比較，在二零二五年十月至十二月期間，各行業的失業率（不經季節性調整）變動不一，但幅度普遍輕微。就業不足率方面，上升主要見於運輸業和資訊及通訊業。同期，清潔及同類活動業的就業不足率錄得下跌。

總就業人數由二零二五年九月至十一月的3 669 900人，下跌至二零二五年十月至十二月的3 667 000人，減少約2 900人。同期的總勞動人口亦由3 814 300人下跌至3 805 200人，減少約9 100人。

失業人數（不經季節性調整）由二零二五年九月至十一月的144 400人下跌至二零二五年十月至十二月的138 200人，減少約6 200人。同期的就業不足人數則由60 900人上升至64 800人，增加約3 900人。

評論

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡評論最新失業數字時表示：「二零二五年十月至十二月經季節性調整的失業率維持在3.8%，與上一個三個月期間相同。就業不足率微升0.1個百分點至1.7%。同期勞動人口和總就業人數輕微下跌，失業人數亦進一步減少。」

展望未來，孫玉菡說：「香港經濟持續增長，加上本地消費氣氛改善，應有助穩定勞工市場。然而，部分行業的就業情況或會因經營環境的挑戰而繼續受到影響。」

進一步資料

失業和就業不足的統計數字，是根據持續進行的「綜合住戶統計調查」結果而編製。

統計調查所採用有關失業及就業不足的定義，緊隨國際勞工組織的建議。當中，就業人口涵蓋所有僱主、自營作業者、僱員（包括全職、兼職及散工等）和無酬家庭從業員。而按行業（或職業）劃分的失業人士是按其以前從事的行業（或職業）劃分。

二零二五年十月至十二月的統計調查所用的樣本，是通過一個根據科學方法設計的抽樣系統選出，包括約26 000個住戶，共約68 000人，以代表本港人口的情況。根據這個樣本編製而成的勞工統計數字反映二零二五年十月至十二月的移動三個月期間的情況。

統計調查是向樣本中各住戶內每名15歲或以上的成員進行訪問，以搜集有關勞動人口特徵的資料。

Unemployment and underemployment statistics for October - December 2025,2026-01-20 16:30,2026-01-20 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000494.htm,"  According to the latest labour force statistics (i.e. provisional figures for October - December 2025) released today (January 20) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in October - December 2025, same as that in September - November 2025. The underemployment rate increased from 1.6% in September - November 2025 to 1.7% in October - December 2025.

  Comparing October - December 2025 with September - November 2025, movements in the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) in different industry sectors varied, but the magnitudes were generally small. As to the underemployment rate, increases were mainly seen in the transportation sector and information and communications sector. Meanwhile, a decline in the underemployment rate was seen in the cleaning and similar activities sector.

  Total employment decreased by around 2 900 from 3 669 900 in September - November 2025 to 3 667 000 in October - December 2025. Over the same period, the labour force also decreased by around 9 100 from 3 814 300 to 3 805 200.

  The number of unemployed persons (not seasonally adjusted) decreased by around 6 200 from 144 400 in September - November 2025 to 138 200 in October - December 2025. Over the same period, the number of underemployed persons increased by around 3 900 from 60 900 to 64 800.

Commentary

  Commenting on the latest unemployment figures, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, said, ""The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at 3.8% in October - December 2025, same as that in the preceding three-month period. The underemployment rate edged up by 0.1 percentage point to 1.7%. Over the same period, the labour force and total employment decreased slightly, and the number of unemployed persons also decreased further.""

  Looking ahead, Mr Chris Sun said, ""The continued growth of the Hong Kong economy and the improvement in local consumption sentiment should help stabilise the labour market. Nonetheless, the employment situations in some sectors may continue to be affected by their challenging business conditions.""

Further information

  The unemployment and underemployment statistics were compiled from the findings of the continuous General Household Survey.

  In the survey, the definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment follow closely those recommended by the International Labour Organization. The employed population covers all employers, self-employed persons, employees (including full-time, part-time, casual workers, etc.) and unpaid family workers. Unemployed persons by industry (or occupation) are classified according to their previous industry (or occupation).

  The survey for October - December 2025 covered a sample of some 26 000 households or 68 000 persons, selected in accordance with a scientifically designed sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong. Labour force statistics compiled from this sample represented the situation in the moving three-month period of October to December 2025.

  Data on labour force characteristics were obtained from the survey by interviewing each member aged 15 or over in the sampled households.

  Statistical tables on the latest labour force statistics can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode200.html). More detailed analysis of the labour force characteristics is given in the ""Quarterly Report on General Household Survey"" which is published four times a year. The latest issue of the report contains statistics for the quarter July - September 2025 while the next issue covering the quarter October - December 2025 will be available by end February 2026.

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-20 16:23,2026-01-20 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000597.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-20 16:23,2026-01-20 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000600.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 20) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

 The public may also call Dial-a-Weather (1878 200) or visit thewebsite of the Hong Kong Observatoryfor the latest weather information and forecasts, or itspage on Weather Information for Senior Citizens."

Digital Policy Office holds annual Cybersecurity Symposium (with photos),2026-01-20 16:22,2026-01-20 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000320.htm,"  The Cybersecurity Symposium convened today (January 20). The Symposium was co-organised by the Digital Policy Office (DPO) and the Hong Kong Internet Registration Corporation Limited, with the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong Cybersecurity Professional Association being the strategic partners.

  Under the theme ""Navigating Cybersecurity Trends, Strengthening Organisational Defence"", the Symposium featured eight keynote speeches and five panel discussions covering key topics including emerging threats, cybersecurity trends, attack and defence strategies, protection of the computer systems of critical infrastructure, and AI. More than 30 experts from the Government, academia, technology, telecommunications, finance, and insurance sectors were invited as speakers and around 1 000 cybersecurity professionals and industry leaders from various sectors attended the Symposium.

  The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, officiated and delivered the welcome remarks at the Symposium. He said, ""Technological development and security protection must be pursued in tandem. Innovation and technology (I&T) can truly benefit society only when it is built on the foundation of safety and reliability. Hong Kong is determined to become an international I&T centre, and will actively support national strategies, and fully leverage the institutional strengths and professional capabilities to build a robust stronghold for digital security.""

  Professor Sun emphasised that cyberattacks and defence today are no longer confined to technical confrontations, but have evolved into a global race that transcends geographical boundaries and integrates intelligence. He also urged all sectors of the community to work together and take practical actions to strengthen cybersecurity defence, thereby ensuring that Hong Kong will not only become a pioneer in developing the digital economy, but also a guardian of cybersecurity.

  The Deputy Commissioner for Digital Policy (Digital Infrastructure), Mr Daniel Cheung, delivered a keynote speech at the Symposium, presenting the DPO's major cybersecurity strategies and initiatives in 2025. He stated that the DPO laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's cybersecurity through various areas, including internal government protection measures, public promotion and support, national and international collaboration, and talent development. The DPO also co-ordinated efforts across various sectors to ensure robust cybersecurity preparations and the smooth execution of several large-scale major events in the second half of last year. He also shared the outcomes of the second Hong Kong Cybersecurity Attack and Defence Drill, which was co-ordinated by the DPO in October last year. He said that last year's drill was further expanded in scale to cover more public services, thereby providing a more comprehensive assessment of the cybersecurity defence and response capabilities of government departments and public organisations with significant results.

  The Cybersecurity Symposium aimed to bring together industry experts to discuss the opportunities and challenges faced by public and private organisations across the three key dimensions of policy, technology, and operations. The participants explored the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape, fostered collaboration and knowledge exchanges between public and private organisations, and thereby further strengthening Hong Kong's cybersecurity resilience. A cybersecurity solutions and services exhibition was also held alongside the Symposium to showcase the latest technologies and offer enterprises and organisations opportunities to engage directly with cybersecurity service providers, share practical experiences and forge connections."

發展局邀請市場就使用三幅已平整用地發展專上教育學生宿舍提交意向書,2026-01-20 15:15,2026-01-20 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000381.htm,"發展局今日（一月二十日）邀請市場就使用三幅分別位於啟德、沙田小瀝源及東涌東的商業用地發展專上教育學生宿舍，於兩個月內提交意向書。

發展局聯同教育局於二○二五年七月推出「城中學舍計劃」，透過放寬發展管制措施，促成私營發展商／營辦商改裝商廈成為學生宿舍，照顧專上院校學生的需要。其後，二○二五年《施政報告》宣布將計劃擴展至涵蓋新建的學生宿舍。

計劃反應理想，至今已收到24宗共涉及約5000個宿位的申請，大多位於市區。除兩宗涉及於私人土地興建新學生宿舍外，其餘為改裝現有建築物，大部分涉及整幢改裝。24宗申請當中22宗已獲確認符合計劃資格（註），其餘兩宗處理當中。該22宗個案的負責方正陸續按放寬發展管制措施尋求審批，有關政府部門正全速處理收到的規劃申請（註：22宗個案當中有18宗毋須規劃申請）及建築圖則。

發展局發言人表示：「除利便市場改裝現有商廈及在現有私人土地興建該等宿舍，正如二○二五年《施政報告》建議，我們亦可透過賣地方式推出合適作學生宿舍發展的用地。這將是我們首次透過於公開市場賣地，鼓勵學生宿舍發展。」

意向書邀請文件（邀請文件）建議的三幅用地均位於市區或擴展市區，交通相對便利，附近社區及商業設施亦比較完善。這些用地在相關分區計劃大綱圖（大綱圖）劃為「商業」用途，換言之按計劃發展學生宿舍將毋須另行提交規劃申請。有關用地已作土地平整，並具備基本基建。

發言人表示：「三幅用地都是『熟地』，且在規劃用途和發展參數方面適宜作學生宿舍，好讓中標者在最短時間內建成學生宿舍，以回應專上學生宿位需求。視乎收集到的市場意向，政府最早可於二○二六／二七年度透過公開招標，推出其中一幅或多幅用地供發展學生宿舍。」

為提升優質宿位供應，從而促進教育樞紐發展的政策目標，發展局初步擬在地契中限制有關土地只可以作學生宿舍用途，並加入轉讓限制不能賣散，即如需轉讓，只可以整個發展轉讓，以確保用地上的學生宿舍能整體發展及營運。建築規約期暫建議為48個月。發展局將透過邀請文件邀請發展商表達對競投一幅或多幅用地的興趣，闡述營運宿舍的初步計劃，並就賣地安排提供意見，包括上述擬議轉讓限制和建築規約期。政府初步估計三幅用地總共可提供約4 500個宿位，但最終宿位數目則視乎項目倡議方提出的設計。三幅用地的發展參數載於邀請文件的附件A，用地的主要資料概述如下：

啟德用地

位於啟德的用地位處啟德發展區前南面停機坪區，鄰近啟德體育園，並毗鄰今年啟用的新急症醫院，附近港鐵站包括啟德站和九龍灣站。用地面積約0.74公頃，最高地積比率為5.8，建築物高度限制為主水平基準上80米，而最高上蓋面積則為65%，可建最高樓面面積約為43000平方米。

沙田小瀝源用地

位於小瀝源的用地周邊集合商業、住宅及其他土地用途，鄰近港鐵第一城站和石門站。用地面積約0.11公頃，最高地積比率為9.5，而建築物高度限制則為主水平基準上120米，可建最高樓面面積約為10000平方米。

東涌東用地

位於東涌新市鎮擴展區的用地毗鄰將於二○二九年通車的港鐵東涌東站。用地面積約0.25公頃，最高地積比率為9，而建築物高度限制則為主水平基準上160米，可建最高樓面面積約為23000平方米。

意向書邀請文件已上載至發展局網站（www.devb.gov.hk/tc/issues_in_focus/planning-lands/invitation-for-expression-of-interest-for-student/index.html）。有意者可於三月二十日（星期五）午夜十二時前以電子方式提交意向書。

註：資格條件包括宿舍租戶應為修讀提供經本地評審副學位及學位課程的指定院校的全日制本地或非本地學生；新建宿舍項目和改裝項目分別須於54個月或18個月內完成；與工業有關的地帶用地和工廈不合資格參與計劃等。"
Development Bureau invites market to submit expressions of interest for student hostel development on three formed sites,2026-01-20 15:15,2026-01-20 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000386.htm,"The Development Bureau (DEVB) today (January 20) invites the market to submit expressions of interest (EOI) within two months for post-secondary student hostel development at three commercial sites in Kai Tak, Siu Lek Yuen (Shatin), and Tung Chung East.

In July 2025, the DEVB and the Education Bureau (EDB) jointly launched the Hostels in the City Scheme. By relaxing some development controls, it has facilitated private developers/operators in converting commercial buildings into student hostels to meet the needs of post-secondary students. Subsequently, it was announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the Scheme would be expanded to also cover new hostel developments.

The Scheme has been met with an encouraging response, with 24 applications received involving around 5000 beds in total, most of which were in urban areas. Apart from two applications that concern new student hostel development on private land, all applications were for the conversion of existing buildings, the majority of which involved wholesale conversion. Out of the 24 applications received, 22 have been confirmed to have complied with the eligibility criteria (Note) as laid down under the Scheme, with the remaining two under processing. Proponents of these 22 cases are starting to apply for development approvals under relaxed development controls, while the relevant government departments are processing at full steam the planning applications (Note: 18 out of 22 cases do not require a planning application) and the building plans received.

A DEVB spokesman said, ""The 2025 Policy Address has recommended that suitable sites for student hostel development be put up through land sale, besides facilitating the market in converting existing commercial buildings and building hostels on existing private land. This would be the first time for us to use land disposal in the open market to encourage the development of student hostels.""

All three sites included in this EOI exercise are located in urban or extended urban areas with better traffic accessibility and more mature community and commercial facilities in the vicinity. These sites are zoned ""Commercial"" on the respective Outline Zoning Plans, meaning developing student hostels according to the Scheme would not require further planning applications. The relevant land has already been formed with basic infrastructure.

The spokesman said, ""The three sites are all readily developable land where zoning and development parameters are suitable for student hostel developments. Those who are awarded the sites through tender could promptly develop these sites into student hostels and help respond to the demand for post-secondary hostel accommodation. Subject to the response received from this EOI exercise, the Government can make available one or more of the three sites supporting student hostel development for land sale through open tender in 2026-27 at the earliest.

In order to properly serve the policy objective of promoting the development of an education hub through increasing the supply of quality hostel places, the DEVB is initially planning to restrict under the lease the use of the sites to student hostels only and impose a restriction against alienation of individual rooms, meaning alienation is only allowed for the entire development as a whole, so as to ensure the hostel facilities on each of the sites are cohesively owned and operated. The Building Covenant period is now proposed to be 48 months. Respondents to the EOI exercise are invited to indicate their interest in bidding for one or more of the sites, share their preliminary plans for the hostel operation, and provide views on the land disposal arrangements including the above proposed alienation restriction and the Building Covenant period. The Government's preliminary estimate is that around 4500 beds can be provided in total on the three sites, but the actual bed numbers will depend on the design of the project proponents. Development parameters of the three sites are summarised in Annex A to the invitation document of this EOI exercise. Some salient features of the sites are highlighted as follows:

Site in Kai Tak

The site in Kai Tak is located at the former South Apron area of the Kai Tak Development Area, near the Kai Tak Sports Park and adjacent to the New Acute Hospital that is expected to commence operation this year. Nearby MTR stations include Kai Tak Station and Kowloon Bay Station. Its site area is around 0.74 hectares (ha) and is subject to a maximum plot ratio (PR) of 5.8, a building height restriction (BHR) of 80mPD, a maximum site coverage of 65 per cent, and a maximum gross floor area (GFA) of around 43000 square metres (sq m).

Site in Siu Lek Yuen, Shatin

The immediate area of the site in Siu Lek Yuen is intermixed with commercial, residential, and other uses and is in proximity to the MTR City One Station and Shek Mun Station. Of around 0.11ha, the site is subject to a maximum PR of 9.5, a BHR of 120mPD, and a maximum GFA of around 10000 sq m. 

Site in Tung Chung East

The site in Tung Chung New Town Extension is located close to the MTR Tung Chung East Station that is expected to commence operation in 2029. Its site area is around 0.25 ha and is subject to a maximum PR of 9, a BHR of 160mPD, and a maximum GFA of around 23000 sq m.

The invitation documents for EOI have been uploaded onto the DEVB's website (www.devb.gov.hk/en/issues_in_focus/planning-lands/invitation-for-expression-of-interest-for-student/index.html). Interested parties should submit a soft copy of their EOI by midnight on March 20 (Friday).

Note: The eligibility criteria include that hostel tenants should be full-time local or non-local students enrolled in locally accredited sub-degree or degree programmes operated by specified institutions; new hostel construction and conversion works must be completed within 54 and 18 months respectively; and industrial zonings and industrial buildings are not eligible under the Scheme."

Government releases report of Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime and announces outcome of relevant disciplinary investigation,2026-01-20 13:11,2026-01-20 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000419.htm,"The Government released today (January 20) the report of the Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime (in Annex), as well as the disciplinary investigation regarding the incident in the procurement of bottled drinking water and relevant follow-up actions.

Report of Task Force
------------------------

The Task Force report summarised the recommendations from the Task Force chaired by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (SFST), Mr Christopher Hui, upon a thorough review of the government procurement regime, and having made reference to the management letter submitted by the Audit Commission on its review of the tender exercise for the procurement of bottled drinking water. The measures focused on four broad directions, namely institutional change, reshaping work culture, enhancement in cross-departmental information exchange, and application of technologies and artificial intelligence, with a view to holistically refining the tendering and procurement regime and procedures.

Following the six quick-win measuresannounced in October last year, the Task Force put forward various further enhancement measures. Starting from January 1 this year, a financial vetting requirement has been introduced to the tendering of goods contracts with a value exceeding $15 million, making it on par with the prevailing practice of conducting financial vetting for service contracts with a contract value exceeding $15 million. Having regard to the nature and scale of procurement as well as practical operational needs, procurement officers may also set the tenderer's experience as an ""essential requirement"" in a more flexible manner, in order to ensure that tenderers are capable of fulfilling contractual obligations. The Treasury has also promulgated internal guidelines to assist officers responsible for conducting financial vetting to identify possible red flags of fraud, so that they will be more vigilant and take timely follow-up actions.

Moreover, following the revisions to the Standard Terms and Conditions of Tenders and Contracts (STC) in October last year that specifically empower procurement officers to disqualify a tenderer if they consider the tenderer not capable of fulfilling the contract terms, and to terminate a contract immediately if they reasonably believe that a contractor has made a material misrepresentation during the contract period, the Government has further updated the STC to stipulate that the Government may terminate a contract immediately on public interest grounds.

To progress with the times and leverage technology, the Government Logistics Department (GLD) will adopt an AI tool to assist in information search on tenderers and contractors on a pilot basis in the first quarter of this year. Subject to the outcome of the trial, the AI tool will be extended to other procuring departments for adoption, so as to enhance the Government's overall operational efficiency in conducting due diligence checks.

Mr Hui said, ""We have long been acting in the interest of the public and handling the incident regarding the procurement of bottled drinking water with openness and transparency. Our commitment to enhance the government procurement regime is ongoing and will never stop. We will continue to refine the Government's procurement work with a resolve to reform, so as to obtain goods and services at the best value for money and ensure prudent use of public money through effective procurement procedures that adapt to the needs of the modern business environment.""

Outcome of disciplinary investigation and relevant follow-up actions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In late October last year, the SFST invited Ms Alice Lau, Administrative Officer Staff Grade A1, to conduct a disciplinary investigation into the incident with a view to ascertaining if any officers should be held accountable for the incident and, if so, the nature and level of their responsibility, such as whether any officers had contravened government or departmental rules and regulations in the process, or failed to act or perform up to the standards commensurate with their ranks and experience.

After reviewing relevant documents, the investigation team led by Ms Lau identified over 20 officers from the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the GLD, and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and requested from them written statements. The investigation team also interviewed some of the officers concerned based on the contents of the statements.

Following an in-depth and comprehensive collection and analysis of facts, the investigation team found that three GLD officers failed to perform up to the standards commensurate with their ranks and experience in the procurement of bottled drinking water exercise. They demonstrated a lack of vigilance and judgement, thus failing to identify obvious irregularities and seize the opportunity to follow up as appropriate and report to their seniors in a timely manner. This resulted in the department missing the chance to detect the false documents and take appropriate actions earlier.

Based on the findings of the above investigation, there is prima facie evidence at this stage suggesting that two of the three GLD officers, including one directorate officer, had failed to appreciate the significance of obvious irregularities and report such irregularities to their seniors in a timely manner. The Government will initiate formal disciplinary proceedings against them and mete out punishment based on the findings of the disciplinary inquiry. Besides, the deficiencies in the work performance of the two officers will be reflected in their appraisals, and the Government will not grant an increment to the officers who have not reached the maximum salary point of their ranks.

For the remaining GLD officer, the Government will reflect the officer's inadequacy in vigilance, judgement, and analytical power in his/her appraisal report and will not grant an increment to him/her. Written advice will also be served, requiring the officer to demonstrate significant improvement in the above competencies in the future.

Having found that there were officers who failed to report the irregularities to their seniors, the investigation team did not find any act of negligence on the part of the former Director of Government Logistics in the incident. However, the fact that all of the three aforementioned GLD officers at different ranks did not perform up to the standards commensurate with their ranks and experience in the incident reflects some prevalence of such substandard performance in the GLD. The report of the Task Force also revealed that there was room for improvement in the GLD's procurement work, with the need to heighten officers' guard against government loss and to put in place a more proactive and prudent procurement process. In this regard, the SFST has written to the former Director of Government Logistics, pointing out that more should have been done during his tenure as the Head of Department to enhance staff's capabilities and develop their sensitivity and proactiveness.

The incident has drawn extensive attention from the public and brought serious disrepute to the Government. In this light, after consulting the Honours and Non-official Justices of the Peace Selection Committee, the Government has decided to reverse the previously announced decision to award the Silver Bauhinia Star to Mr Carlson Chan, and he has been informed."
財庫局局長及公務員事務局局長就檢討政府採購機制專責小組報告和相關紀律調查結果會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）（附短片）,2026-01-20 13:02,2026-01-20 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000407.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇及公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（一月二十日）公布檢討政府採購機制專責小組報告，以及就採購樽裝飲用水事件進行的紀律調查結果。以下為他們會見傳媒的開場發言：

財經事務及庫務局局長：由我領導的檢討政府採購機制專責小組去年年底已經完成檢視政府採購制度的工作。政府亦已詳細審視就採購樽裝飲用水事件進行的紀律調查報告。今天我會總結專責小組的工作成果，稍後公務員事務局局長（楊何蓓茵女士）會交代紀律調查結果和相關跟進行動。

今日發布的專責小組報告總結了我們過去數月檢視政府採購制度後所提出的建議。其間，我們也參考了審計署就審查採購樽裝飲用水招標過程所提交的管理建議書。

專責小組報告列出的優化措施聚焦四大方向，包括是從制度方面、從工作文化方面、從部門間信息互通方面，以及應用科技和人工智能這方面。除了我去年十月公布的一系列完善政府招標和採購機制先行措施，報告內亦列出專責小組提出的進一步優化措施，包括為價值超過1,500萬元的貨品合約引入財政審核安排；進一步更新《招標和合約的標準條款》，讓政府可基於公眾利益即時終止合約；以「先行先試」模式採用人工智能工具提升政府採購過程的盡職審查效率等，目標是全方位完善招標和採購的機制及程序。

專責小組提出的各項建議已經落實，而政府物流服務署（物流署）採用人工智能工具的措施也進行得如火如荼。物流署上月底為港島和部分離島政府辦公室樽裝飲用水合約進行的公開招標正是採納了相關建議，在重點領域加強要求，協助採購人員更有效防範詐騙行為和揀選有能力的供應商。

我們持續優化政府採購制度的決心不止於此。展望未來，我們會繼續以革新的決心推動政府採購工作更臻完善，透過有效及切合現代商業社會需要的採購程序，取得物有所值的貨品和服務，使公帑用得其所。

以下，我將時間交給公務員事務局局長向各位交代紀律調查事宜。謝謝大家。

公務員事務局局長：財庫局局長於去年十月底邀請首長級甲一級政務官劉焱女士就事件進行紀律調查，以釐清事件中是否有人員需要負責；如有，其責任的性質和輕重，例如是否有人員在行事過程中違反政府或部門的內部規定，或是否有人員的行為或工作表現未能達到與其本身職級和經驗相稱的水平。

經覆檢相關文件後，劉女士領導的調查組識別了超過20名來自財庫局、物流署及食物環境衞生署的人員，要求他們作出陳述，並因應陳述內容約見部分涉事人員。

經深入而全面的事實搜集及分析後，調查組發現在是次採購樽裝飲用水的工作中，有三位物流署人員的表現未能達到與其本身職級和經驗相稱的水平，缺乏應有的警覺性和判斷力，以致未能識別明顯不妥之處，也未能把握時機作出適當跟進及向上級及時匯報，令部門錯過及早識破虛假文書和盡早採取適當行動的時機。

基於上述調查結果，現階段表面證據顯示上述三位物流署人員之中的兩位，包括一位首長級人員，涉嫌未能及時識別明顯不妥之處所揭示的重要性並且上報，政府會對他們展開正式紀律研訊，並按研訊裁決作出懲處。此外，該兩位人員在工作能力上的欠缺會反映在其考績報告內，政府亦會向未達頂薪點的人員停止發放增薪點。

餘下一位物流署人員，雖然在事件中有履行向上級報告的責任，但政府仍然會在考績報告內反映其警覺性、判斷力和分析能力不足，也會停止向該名人員發放增薪點，並給予書面告誡，要求該人員日後在上述各項能力均要展示明顯進步。

調查顯示處事人員在事件中未有向上呈報不妥之處，調查組沒有發現前任物流署署長在事件中有疏忽的地方。然而，三名前述的物流署人員在事件中的表現都未達與其本身職級和經驗相稱的水平，反映這些不足之處在署內有普遍性。專責小組的報告也顯示部門的採購工作有改善空間，需要提升應有的觸覺以避免政府受損，處理採購應該更積極更謹慎。

就此，財庫局局長已去信前任物流署署長，指出他出任部門首長期間，在提升下屬工作能力及提升他們觸覺和積極性，應更有作為。

是次事件引起公眾高度關注，對政府聲譽造成嚴重影響。經行政署徵詢授勳及非官守太平紳士遴選委員會意見後，政府決定撤回早前公布向陳嘉信先生頒授銀紫荊星章的決定，並已通知陳先生，不會向其頒授銀紫荊星章。我的匯報到此為止。"

專責小組報告總結財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇領導的專責小組深入檢視政府採購制度後所提出的建議，也參考了審計署就審查採購樽裝飲用水招標過程所提交的管理建議書。各項措施聚焦制度改革、重塑工作文化、加強部門間的信息互通，以及應用科技和人工智能四大方向，務求全方位完善招標和採購的機制及程序。

繼去年十月公布的六項先行措施，專責小組報告提出多項進一步優化措施，當中包括由今年一月一日起，為涉及價值超過1,500萬元的貨品合約招標時引入財政審核安排，使之與現行為價值超過1,500萬元的服務合約進行財政審核的做法一致。採購人員也可因應採購性質和規模以及實際運作需要，更靈活地把投標者經驗列作「必要要求」，以確保投標者有能力履行合約責任。庫務署亦已發出內部指引，協助進行財政審核的人員辨識潛在欺詐跡象，讓他們提高警覺和及時採取跟進行動。

此外，繼去年十月修訂《招標和合約的標準條款》（「標準條款」）時明確賦權採購人員在認為投標者不具備履行合約條款的能力時可取消其投標資格；以及在合理地認為承辦商於合約期間曾提交重大失實申述可即時終止合約外，政府進一步更新「標準條款」，訂明政府可基於公眾利益即時終止合約。

為與時並進及善用科技，政府物流服務署（物流署）今年第一季會以「先行先試」模式，採用人工智能工具協助蒐集投標者和承辦商的資訊。視乎試驗結果，人工智能工具將推廣至各採購部門，以提升政府在盡職審查的整體工作效率。

許正宇說：「我們一直站在公眾利益的角度，以開誠布公的態度處理是次採購樽裝飲用水事件。而我們持續優化政府採購制度的決心不止於此，會繼續以革新的決心推動政府採購工作更臻完善，透過有效及切合現代商業社會需要的採購程序，取得物有所值的貨品和服務，使公帑用得其所。」

紀律調查報告及跟進行動
———————————

財庫局局長於去年十月底邀請首長級甲一級政務官劉焱就事件進行紀律調查，藉此釐清事件上是否有人員需要負責及（如有）其責任的性質和輕重，例如是否有人員在行事過程中違反政府或部門的內部規定，或是否有人員的行為或工作表現未能達到與其本身職級和經驗相稱的水平。

經覆檢相關文件後，劉焱領導的調查組識別了超過二十名來自財庫局、物流署及食物環境衞生署的人員，要求他們作出陳述，並因應陳述內容約見部分涉事人員。

經深入而全面的事實搜集及分析後，調查組發現在是次採購樽裝飲用水的工作中，有三位物流署人員的表現未能達到與其本身職級和經驗相稱的水平，缺乏應有的警覺性和判斷力，以致未能識別明顯不妥之處，也未能把握時機作出適當跟進及向上級及時匯報，令部門錯過及早識破虛假文書和盡早採取適當行動的機會。

基於上述調查結果，現階段表面證據顯示上述三位物流署人員中的兩位，包括一位首長級人員，未能及時識別明顯不妥之處所揭示的重要性並上報，政府會對他們展開正式紀律研訊，並按研訊裁定作出懲處。此外，該兩位人員在工作能力上的欠缺會反映在其考績報告內，政府亦會向未達頂薪點的人員停止發放增薪點。

至於餘下一位物流署人員，政府會在考績報告內反映其警覺性、判斷力和分析能力不足，也會停止向該人員發放增薪點，並給予書面告誡，要求該人員日後在上述各項能力均要展示明顯進步。

調查顯示因處事人員在事件中未有向上呈報不妥之處，故調查組沒有發現前物流署署長在事件中有疏忽的地方。然而，三名前述的不同級別的物流署人員在事件中的表現皆未達其本身職級和經驗相稱的水平，反映該等不足之處在署內有普遍性。專責小組的報告也顯示部門的採購工作有改善空間，應提升應有的觸覺以避免政府利益受損，處理採購更積極更謹慎。就此，財庫局局長已去信前物流署署長，指出他出任部門首長期間，在提升下屬工作能力及提升他們觸覺和積極性，應更有作為。

是次事件引起公眾高度關注，對政府聲譽造成嚴重影響。有見及此，經行政署徵詢授勳及非官守太平紳士遴選委員會意見後，政府決定撤回早前向陳嘉信頒授銀紫荊星章的決定，並已通知陳嘉信，不會向其頒授銀紫荊星章。"

CFS announces risk assessment study results on microbiological quality of ready-to-eat sauces and like products,2026-01-20 11:17,2026-01-20 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026011600774.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (January 20) announced the results of a risk assessment study on the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat sauces and like products. All samples were compliant with the microbiological food safety criteria for pathogenic bacteria (i.e. Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens). The overall result was satisfactory.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""Ready-to-eat sauces and like products, such as gravies, dressings and dips, are often served to enhance the flavour of food or complement dishes. These products are often made in large batches. If these ready-to-eat products are contaminated by foodborne pathogens and held for extended periods without proper temperature control, the pathogenic bacteria may proliferate in the contaminated sauces to levels capable of causing foodborne illnesses. Additionally, the preparation of ready-to-eat sauces may involve a variety of ingredients, some of which may be fresh and not subjected to further cooking, making them potential sources of contamination.""

Given the above-mentioned risks, the CFS therefore conducted a study and collected from various food businesses 50 samples of dressings/dips and 50 samples of gravies. The microbiological quality of the samples was assessed against the criteria stipulated in Microbiological Guidelines for Food.

The study results showed that all samples complied with the microbiological food safety criteria for pathogenic bacteria. Test results of individual samples, including the total bacterial count (aerobic colony count) in a curry sauce sample and the Escherichia coli count in an avocado-based sauce sample indicated that there may be room for improvement in terms of food handling processes as well as personal and environmental hygiene, respectively, but there was no food safety concern. The CFS provided advice on Good Hygiene Practices to the staff concerned. Follow-up samples were taken and the testing results were satisfactory.

To ensure food safety, the spokesman reminded the food trade to ensure proper time and temperature control when preparing ready-to-eat sauces, especially during storage and cooling. Raw food should be stored and handled separately from cooked and ready-to-eat food to avoid cross-contamination. Food handlers should strictly implement and maintain personal and environmental hygiene, including handwashing with soap regularly.

The spokesman also advised members of the public to consume ready-to-eat sauces or like products with raw or undercooked ingredients as soon as possible after purchase. High-risk groups, including pregnant women, young children, the elderly, people with weakened immunity, and people taking antibiotics or antacids, are advised not to consume ready-to-eat sauces or like products with raw or undercooked ingredients.

The study is available on the CFS's website at www.cfs.gov.hk."

​食安中心公布即食醬料及類似製品的微生物質素風險評估研究結果,2026-01-20 11:00,2026-01-20 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026011600776.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（一月二十日）公布即食醬料及類似製品的微生物質素風險評估研究結果，全部樣本在致病菌（即沙門氏菌屬、金黃葡萄球菌、蠟樣芽孢桿菌和產氣莢膜梭狀芽孢桿菌）方面，均符合微生物含量的食物安全準則，質素整體令人滿意。

中心發言人說：「即食醬料及類似製品，如肉汁、調味醬汁和蘸醬，常用以提升食物的風味或搭配菜餚。這些製品通常大批製造。若這些即食製品受食源性病原體污染，並在缺乏適當溫度控制的情況下長時間存放，致病菌便有機會大量繁殖至可引致食源性疾病的水平。此外，配製即食醬料可能採用多種配料，當中或有未經進一步烹煮的新鮮配料，亦可能成為潛在污染來源。」

考慮到上述風險，中心因此進行研究，從不同食物業商戶收集了50個調味醬汁／蘸醬樣本及50個肉汁樣本，根據《食品微生物含量指引》的訂明準則，評估樣本的微生物質素。

研究結果顯示，全部樣本的致病菌檢測均符合微生物含量的食物安全準則。個別樣本的檢測結果，包括一個咖喱汁樣本的細菌總數（需氧菌落計數）及一個牛油果醬的大腸桿菌含量，分別顯示在處理食物的程序及個人和環境衞生方面或有改善空間，但不涉及食物安全問題。中心已向相關人員提供遵循良好衞生規範的建議。其後抽取的跟進樣本，檢驗結果均屬滿意。

為確保食物安全，發言人提醒食物業界在製作即食醬料時，特別是貯存和降溫期間，應確保適當的時間和溫度控制，並把生的食物與熟食及即食食品分開存放和處理，以免交叉污染。食物處理人員應實施和保持嚴格的個人和環境衞生措施，包括定時用梘液洗手。

發言人亦建議市民，購買含有生或未經煮熟配料的即食醬料或類似製品後應盡早食用。高危人士（包括孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士，以及服用抗生素或抗胃酸藥人士）不宜進食含有生或未經煮熟配料的即食醬料或類似製品。

周五湖巡視員（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室信息中心二級巡視員）、Sean（香港互聯網註冊管理有限公司主席李帆風）、Tony（數字政策專員黃志光）、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家上午好！我非常高興出席由數字政策辦公室（數字辦）和香港互聯網註冊管理有限公司合辦，並由香港警務處網絡安全及科技罪案調查科和香港網絡安全專業協會擔任策略夥伴的網絡安全技術論壇，與各位業界翹楚、專家學者齊聚一堂，共同探討如何攜手加強網絡安全，推動數字社會的持續發展。

今屆論壇以「掌握網安趨勢強化機構防線」為主題，既呼應全球數字安全形勢的演變，也擔當推動跨界協作的重要角色。當今網絡攻防已不再純粹是技術對抗，而是跨越地域、融合智能的全域較量。

習近平主席在去年十一月舉行的亞太經合組織（亞太區經濟合作組織）峰會上指出，為開創可持續的美好明天，各經濟體要強化數智賦能，塑造亞太創新發展新優勢，充分發揮新技術的驅動和賦能作用，加快培育發展新質生産力，推進數據安全有序流動，加快數字經濟高質量發展。這一重要倡議提醒我們，科技發展與安全保障必須同步並行，只有在安全、可靠的基礎上，創新科技才能真正造福社會。香港銳意發展成為國際創新科技中心，將積極響應國家部署，發揮制度優勢與專業實力，成為守護數字安全的堅實堡壘。

為此，香港特區政府一直積極推動各界持份者互相合作，推出多項措施，包括定期舉辦專業交流論壇、宣傳教育活動和培訓課程，向業界與市民發放事故信息和防護建議，也為本地企業、非牟利機構和學校免費提供系統檢驗、事故應急支援、威脅警報、防禦指引與資訊保安教育，務求全面提高社會整體對資訊保安的認知，協助各界妥善應對網絡威脅，共同提升網絡安全。同時，數字辦亦持續完善政府資訊系統的管治，加強跨部門協作，舉辦攻防演練，提升技術防護措施，進一步強化政府網絡安全保護能力，確保政府資訊系統安全可靠。

為進一步鞏固關鍵基礎設施安全，《保護關鍵基礎設施（電腦系統）條例》已於今年一月一日正式生效。條例旨在確保關鍵基礎設施營運者採取適當措施保護其電腦系統，以減低因網絡攻擊導致必要服務受到擾亂或破壞的可能，從而提升香港整體關鍵基礎設施的電腦系統安全。

各位，數字時代意味着機遇與挑戰並存，而網絡安全既是責任，更是使命。我衷心感謝各位長期以來對香港網絡安全工作的支持。讓我們並肩前行，以務實行動築牢安全防線，使香港不只成為發展數字經濟的「先行者」，更擔當網絡安全的「守護者」，為國家數字發展貢獻更大力量！謝謝大家！"

今屆論壇以「掌握網安趨勢強化機構防線」為主題，既呼應全球數字安全形勢的演變，也擔當推動跨界協作的重要角色。當今網絡攻防已不再純粹是技術對抗，而是跨越地域、融合智能的全域較量。

習近平主席在去年十一月舉行的亞太經合組織（亞太區經濟合作組織）峰會上指出，為開創可持續的美好明天，各經濟體要強化數智賦能，塑造亞太創新發展新優勢，充分發揮新技術的驅動和賦能作用，加快培育發展新質生産力，推進數據安全有序流動，加快數字經濟高質量發展。這一重要倡議提醒我們，科技發展與安全保障必須同步並行，只有在安全、可靠的基礎上，創新科技才能真正造福社會。香港銳意發展成為國際創新科技中心，將積極響應國家部署，發揮制度優勢與專業實力，成為守護數字安全的堅實堡壘。

為此，香港特區政府一直積極推動各界持份者互相合作，推出多項措施，包括定期舉辦專業交流論壇、宣傳教育活動和培訓課程，向業界與市民發放事故信息和防護建議，也為本地企業、非牟利機構和學校免費提供系統檢驗、事故應急支援、威脅警報、防禦指引與資訊保安教育，務求全面提高社會整體對資訊保安的認知，協助各界妥善應對網絡威脅，共同提升網絡安全。同時，數字辦亦持續完善政府資訊系統的管治，加強跨部門協作，舉辦攻防演練，提升技術防護措施，進一步強化政府網絡安全保護能力，確保政府資訊系統安全可靠。

為進一步鞏固關鍵基礎設施安全，《保護關鍵基礎設施（電腦系統）條例》已於今年一月一日正式生效。條例旨在確保關鍵基礎設施營運者採取適當措施保護其電腦系統，以減低因網絡攻擊導致必要服務受到擾亂或破壞的可能，從而提升香港整體關鍵基礎設施的電腦系統安全。

各位，數字時代意味着機遇與挑戰並存，而網絡安全既是責任，更是使命。我衷心感謝各位長期以來對香港網絡安全工作的支持。讓我們並肩前行，以務實行動築牢安全防線，使香港不只成為發展數字經濟的「先行者」，更擔當網絡安全的「守護者」，為國家數字發展貢獻更大力量！謝謝大家！"

醫健通提升「個人資料夾」功能　授權指定境外醫療機構存入放射紀錄,2026-01-20 10:00,2026-01-20 10:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000250.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）今日（一月二十日）公布，香港市民由一月二十七日起可透過醫健通流動應用程式的「個人資料夾」功能，授權指定境外醫療機構，為他們存入放射檢查報告及影像至個人醫健通戶口，讓市民更便捷及安全地保存和運用境外就醫時的電子健康紀錄，從而獲得更連貫的護理服務。

由一月二十七日起，市民前往三間指定境外醫療機構（即香港大學深圳醫院、深圳新風和睦家醫院和中山陳星海中西醫結合醫院）接受放射科服務前，可透過醫健通流動應用程式的「個人資料夾」功能提交授權申請。市民隨即會在流動應用程式收到「授權二維碼」。市民在指定醫療機構求診時，可向當地醫護人員展示二維碼，並出示香港身份證以核實身分和授權。該醫療機構即可協助市民將該次服務的放射檢查報告及影像直接存入其個人醫健通戶口。此外，醫健通用戶亦可透過流動應用程式的「照顧者」功能為家人申請使用相關服務。

相比起現時市民可自行存放醫療紀錄至個人醫健通戶口，是次的功能升級有助存入一些市民較難自行上傳的高解像度放射影像。市民除可透過流動應用程式取覽相關紀錄，亦可授權香港醫護機構在跟進護理時，通過醫健通系統取覽。

醫衞局發言人說：「醫衞局自二○二四年七月起推行『個人資料夾』功能，讓市民在自攜病歷的原則下，自行存入他們在境外求醫時取得的醫療紀錄至醫健通。這次推出的高解像度放射影像升級功能，標誌着跨境病歷互通的重要進展，進一步助力市民整合不同醫療流程的病歷紀錄至個人醫健通戶口，方便日後管理及使用。我們會根據推展新功能所得的經驗，持續優化流程及用戶體驗，並逐步擴展至更多醫療紀錄類別及醫療機構，務求更有效地支援跨境使用醫療服務的市民。」

醫衞局已於三間指定境外醫療機構設立支援站，協助香港市民登記醫健通、下載醫健通流動應用程式及使用相關功能。市民亦可於醫健通流動應用程式、專題網站及社交媒體瀏覽介紹短片，了解該新功能的使用方法和用途。

"""Personal Folder"" function of eHealth upgraded to authorise designated medical institutions outside Hong Kong to deposit radiology records ",2026-01-20 10:00,2026-01-20 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000255.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced today (January 20) that Hong Kong citizens can authorise designated medical institutions outside Hong Kong to deposit their radiology reports and images into their personal eHealth accounts through the ""Personal Folder"" function in the eHealth mobile application (eHealth App) starting from January 27. This will enable citizens to store and utilise electronic health records from healthcare services received outside Hong Kong in a more convenient and secure manner, thereby facilitating greater continuity of care.

  Starting from January 27, citizens can submit an authorisation application through the ""Personal Folder"" function in the eHealth App before receiving radiology services at three designated medical institutions outside Hong Kong (namely the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen New Frontier United Family Hospital and Zhongshan Chen Xinghai Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine). Citizens will then receive an ""Authorisation QR Code"" in the mobile application. When seeking medical care at the designated medical institutions, citizens can present the QR code along with their Hong Kong identity card to local healthcare personnel for identity verification and authorisation. The medical institution will then assist the citizens to directly deposit the radiology reports and images of that consultation into their personal eHealth accounts. Moreover, eHealth users can apply for the service on behalf of family members using the ""Caregiver"" function in the mobile application.

  Compared to the current arrangement where citizens can self-deposit medical records into their personal eHealth accounts, this upgraded function supports the deposit of high-resolution radiology images, which are often challenging for citizens to upload themselves. In addition to viewing the relevant records through the mobile application, citizens can also authorise healthcare providers in Hong Kong to access them through the eHealth system during follow-up care.

  A spokesperson for the HHB said, ""Since July 2024, the HHB has launched the 'Personal Folder' function to enable citizens to self-deposit medical records obtained during consultations outside Hong Kong to eHealth, under the principle of 'bring your own health records'. The introduction of the high-resolution radiology image function upgrade marks a significant step in cross-boundary medical record sharing. This upgrade supports citizens in consolidating medical records obtained from different healthcare processes into their personal eHealth accounts, offering more convenience for future management and usage. Building on the experience gained from implementing the new function, we will continue to optimise the processes and enhance the user experience, and gradually extend the function to cover more types of medical records and institutions, with a view to more effectively supporting citizens using cross-boundary healthcare services.""

  The HHB has set up support stations at the three designated medical institutions outside Hong Kong to assist Hong Kong citizens in registering for eHealth, downloading the eHealth App, and using the relevant function. Citizens can also viewtutorial videos on the eHealth App, eHealth's thematic website and social media platforms to learn about the usage and purpose of the new function.

  For more details, please visit the eHealth thematic websiteor call the hotline at 3467 6300. The hotline service runs from 9am to 9pm from Mondays to Fridays (except public holidays)."

陳茂波下午與阿曼蘇丹國（阿曼）經濟部部長H.E. Said Mohammed Al-Saqri博士會面，雙方討論如何推動兩地深化在金融、貿易、綠色轉型、產業發展等領域的互利合作。

陳茂波在會面上表示，阿曼正在從石油驅動的增長朝更多元化的經濟結構轉型，積極推動綠色轉型和可再生能源，並進一步強化與中國的經貿與投資，香港作為「超級聯繫人」，一方面可協助內地企業聯同香港企業出海，到阿曼當地投資，支持其基建和產業發展；另一方面，作為亞洲的國際金融中心，不僅可為阿曼企業提供理想的籌融資平台，以及離岸人民幣的投資和風險管理產品，同時也可透過兩地資本市場的聯通，在金融市場上相互促進。陳茂波表示，歡迎兩地證券交易所和監管機構探討互惠合作，讓企業雙重上市或到對方市場作第二上市。

"FS begins visit to Davos, Switzerland (with photos/video)",2026-01-20 09:00,2026-01-20 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/20/P2026012000077.htm,"​The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, arrived in Davos, Switzerland yesterday (January 19, Davos time) and immediately commenced his programme at the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting.

In the afternoon, Mr Chan met with the Minister of Economy of the Sultanate of Oman (Oman), H.E. Dr Said Mohammed Al-Saqri. During the meeting, the two sides discussed ways to deepen mutually beneficial cooperation in areas such as finance, trade, green transformation and industrial development.

Mr Chan noted that Oman is transitioning from an oil-driven growth model towards a more diversified economic structure, with active efforts to promote green transformation and renewable energy, while further strengthening its economic and investment ties with China. As a “super connector”, Hong Kong is well positioned to support this process — on the one hand, by facilitating Mainland and Hong Kong enterprises to invest in Oman to support its infrastructure and industrial development; and on the other hand, by leveraging its status as an international financial centre in Asia to provide Omani enterprises with an ideal platform for fundraising and financing, as well as offshore Renminbi investment and risk management products. Mr Chan also pointed out that financial market connectivity between the two places could foster mutual development, and expressed support for the stock exchanges and regulatory authorities of both sides to explore reciprocal cooperation, including opportunities for dual or secondary listings.

In the evening, Mr Chan attended the welcome reception of the WEF Annual Meeting, where he engaged with participants from around the world. He will continue his visit in Davos today (January 20, Davos time)."
