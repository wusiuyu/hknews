記者：剛才見局長（買商品）買得很開心，買了很多東西，能否說說買了些甚麼？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：買了一對「喜洋洋」和「樂融融」，其實我已經有比較細小的公仔，但這一對是會動的，你按按它的鰭，它的手腳便會擺動，所以非常有趣。另外，有一個是我們的pin（徽章），具香港特色搶包山的pin。還有一個搪瓷杯，十分大並有蓋子，這亦是可以將香港人很喜歡的餐蛋麵、沙嗲牛肉麵放進去的；它同時有蓋子，所以若食物需要保溫，亦可以焗一下。也有一些小型的搪瓷杯，分別是廣東、澳門和香港的特色，應該可以掛在手袋上作裝飾，既有特色，亦有些「潮」，所以都買得很開心。

記者：局長，警方最近拘捕了一些售賣「黃牛票」的人士。其實全運會會否是一個好的機會推行實名制買票？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：楊主任（全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室主任楊德強）早前說過，全運會將有統一的購票平台，亦會是實名制（買票），詳情會在可以發售門票時公布。

記者：全運會的商品如何帶動消費？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：大家看到今次剛才發布的全運會商品，豐儉由人，有便宜有貴，我們由pin開始，至一些大家將來到金鋪亦能買到的金幣，中等價錢的亦有公仔，或一些香港特色的東西，也有一些實用的東西，例如暖壺，我剛才說可以用作吃公仔麵的杯，這些都是大家可以選擇的。我知道大家現在很喜歡各類文創（產品），全運會（十五運會）只有一次，我們亦是首次與廣東和澳門共同承辦全運會，只有一次，將來若再有機會，便會有新的設計。所以，我希望大家都喜愛這些商品，我亦很有信心大家會跟我一樣買得很開心。多謝大家。

記者：局長，大約用了多少錢？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：大約幾百元，我買得太興奮，都忘記了用了多少錢，但又不是很貴，所以大家可以多買一些。多謝。"

Since its opening to the public on August 7 last year, the National Security Exhibition Gallery of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has been well received by the community. Today (July 12), it received its one-millionth visitor.

The one-millionth visitor is a group of Primary 3 students from Po Leung Kuk Luk Hing Too Primary School, who visited the Gallery this afternoon with their teacher. Eleven students and their teacher received a commemorative certificate and a trophy from the Secretary General of the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR, Mr Au Chi-kwong,the officiating guest of the ceremony.

Mr Au said, ""The National Security Exhibition Gallery plays a vital role in national security education. Through its rich exhibits, concise texts, technological displays, and interesting interactive installations, the Gallery has earned praise and recognition from all sectors of society, resulting in a constant stream of visitors. The highest single-day attendance exceeded 13 000.

""National security is like sunshine, air and water. When you have it but do not treasure it, you will regret when losing it. The 'black-clad violence' and the Hong Kong version of the 'colour revolution' in 2019 has inflicted wounds and damage on Hong Kong that we will never forget. We must not forget the pain as wounds heal; we must remain ever vigilant to safeguard national security, and ensure high-quality development with high-level security.

""I am very pleased with the achievements of the National Security Exhibition Gallery over the past 11 months, and I look forward to continual support from the public and various sectors of the community. By visiting the Gallery, the public can deepen their understanding of national security and further strengthen the collective effort to safeguard it.""

The National Security Exhibition Gallery is the first national security education base in the HKSAR. It aims to enhance public awareness and understanding of national security, foster patriotism and affection for the country, encourage active participation in safeguarding national security, and showcase Hong Kong's unique advantages of being backed by the Motherland and connected to the world. The HKSAR Government will continue to promote public engagement through regular national security exhibitions and diverse publicity and education activities, with a view to strengthening the public's understanding of and support for national security and safeguarding it of their own accord."

香港特別行政區國家安全展覽廳自去年八月七日開放予公眾參觀以來，深受市民歡迎，今日（七月十二日）迎來第一百萬名參觀者。

第一百萬名參觀者是保良局陸慶濤小學的三年級學生，今日下午他們由老師帶領下參觀展覽廳。老師聯同11名學生從主禮嘉賓香港特別行政區維護國家安全委員會秘書長區志光手中接過紀念證書及獎座。

「國家安全好像陽光、空氣和水，擁有時不懂珍惜，失去時後悔莫及。二○一九年的『黑暴』、港版『顏色革命』對香港造成的傷害、破壞，是我們永遠忘不了的痛。我們不能好了傷疤忘了痛，要時刻提高警惕，守護好國家安全，以高水平安全護航高質量發展。」

「我非常高興見到國家安全展覽廳過去11個月來取得的成果，並期望能繼續得到市民及社會各界的支持。市民可以透過參觀展覽廳，深化對國家安全的認識，進一步鞏固提升全民守護國家安全的力量。」

國家安全展覽廳是香港特別行政區首個實體國家安全教育基地，目的是加強市民對國家安全的認知和理解，激發市民的愛國情懷，鼓勵市民積極參與國家安全建設，展示香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢。特區政府會持之以恆，透過常設的國家安全展覽及不同宣傳教育活動，促進社會各界共同參與，加強市民對國家安全的認識和支持，自覺維護國家安全。"

大家好。歡迎各位蒞臨全國運動會香港賽區官方特許商品發布會。

今日真的是一個喜洋洋、樂融融的日子。再過120日，我們便會迎來粵港澳大灣區共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會和緊接其後的殘特奧會。全運會四年一度，是國家規模最大、水準最高的綜合運動盛事，有一些項目，例如國球乒乓球，贏取全運會金牌比贏奧運金牌更難，因為不少省市都擁有自己的世界冠軍！而殘特奧會除了競技比賽以外，更是彰顯傷健共融，鼓勵殘疾人士積極參與的大型體育活動。今屆全運會由粵港澳首次共同承辦，更加意義非凡，不僅體現了國家對大灣區發展的高度重視，更是彰顯廣東省、香港特區和澳門特區三地協同合作與發展成果的最佳舞台。

香港特區政府自二○二三年底以來一直努力不懈，力求推動全民參與全運會，讓市民及訪港的遊客們從方方面面感受體育盛事的魅力及熱情。在香港貿易發展局及香港品牌發展局的全力支持下，我們成功甄選多家優秀企業，設計及生產一系列別具香港特色的全運會特許商品。這些商品既承載着全運會的精神，更融入維港景觀、城市地標、本地美食等元素，展現香港賽區獨特魅力。

近月來，大家已經有不少機會跟全運會吉祥物「喜洋洋」和「樂融融」見面，許多朋友都追問我在哪裏可買到一對帶回家中。今日，我很高興宣布，香港賽區特許商品正式進入發售階段，將會在下星期一，即七月十四日開始至全運會期間全面發售特許商品，首批官方零售店已進駐啟德體育園零售館、西九龍站及灣仔入境事務大樓，未來將陸續擴展至全港更多地點，方便市民和旅客選購。特許商品零售商亦會引入廣東賽區的特許商品來香港銷售。此外，今日會場特設快閃店，我等一會也會去掃貨，也歡迎各位來賓把握機會，率先體驗這份專屬全運會的紀念意義。

在此，我要特別感謝廣東賽區執委會，以及所有參與特許商品開發的企業夥伴，正是大家的創意和專業能力，讓本屆全運會更加多姿多彩。

全運會精彩將會陸續登場。為讓市民投入參與全運會和殘特奧會倒計時100天活動，我們將舉辦「全運100．全民共創百萬公里大挑戰」活動，參與的市民可由今日下午六時起至七月二十六日，進行不同的運動，包括步行、跑步或騎單車等，然後將完成的運動里數紀錄上載全運會網頁上的連結。讓我們一同完成目標，一齊身體力行迎全運。

目前，香港賽區的各項籌備工作已經進行得如火如荼。我呼籲市民及遊客朋友們密切關注賽事動態，並在賽事期間，為運動健兒加油助威。

在此，我預祝香港代表團在全運會比賽取得佳績，也期待特許商品能得到大家喜愛。祝願大家週末快樂，大家亦努力一同支持全運會。謝謝大家。"
逾八十名青年學員完成法治教育領袖培訓計劃第三階段基礎課程（附圖）,2025-07-12 17:16,2025-07-12 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071100585.htm,"逾八十名來自十八區地區青年委員會和本地大學的青年學員今日（七月十二日）完成由律政司主辦，為期兩日的第三階段「傳承共建法治社會」法治教育領袖培訓計劃（培訓計劃）基礎課程。課程旨在透過講授與香港法治以及法律制度相關的基礎議題，培訓社區不同界別人士成為法治教育領袖，賦能他們在社區全方位推廣法治。

承接律政司司長林定國資深大律師以及第十四屆全國人民代表大會常務委員會委員、立法會議員李慧琼博士上周首日講課，律政司副司長張國鈞博士於第二日課堂向學員闡述傳播法治的重要性，以及法治教育領袖的責任和角色。

法治教育督導委員會統籌和協調工作小組成員陳澤銘和法治教育督導委員會成員何淑瑛亦擔任導師，講解香港法律專業、法院程序與替代爭議解決服務等內容。課程並邀得從事教育工作多年的精英匯集團創辦人及主席梁賀琪博士，就有效傳播法治信息的溝通技巧分享心得。

張國鈞博士表示，法治是香港的「金字招牌」，亦是本港在「一國兩制」下保持長期繁榮穩定的基礎。香港正處於開創新局面、實現新飛躍的關鍵期，各界要堅守法治，發揮香港國際化優勢，以法治推動高質量發展，因此法治推廣尤其重要。

他指，地區青年委員會成員一直在社區推動青年發展和公民教育，在法治推廣的工作中肯定可以擔當重要角色。而有志從事教育工作的大學生亦將會是學校推動法治教育工作的中堅力量，他們的積極參與無疑能夠為香港法治的傳承與發展注入新動力。

他表示，傳播是一門學問。律政司設計此課程特別着重以多元互動和淺白易明的方式，配合生活化的例子及案例，讓學員更易掌握法治知識。課程亦特別邀請專家向學員傳授傳播和溝通技巧，更好裝備他們日後成為法治教育領袖。

課堂後，律政司隨即舉行第三階段基礎課程的結業禮（包括證書頒授），由法治教育督導委員會成員何淑瑛和曾勁峰教授，以及工作小組成員陳澤銘向完成第三階段兩日基礎課程的學員頒發證書。

展望將來，律政司將繼續舉辦第三階段培訓計劃的進階及拓展課程，通過參觀執法機關、舉辦模擬法庭審訊活動、法律主題講座和推廣法治實踐活動，進一步加強已完成基礎課程的學員對於法律制度和程序實踐的認識，加強他們在社區推廣法治信息的信心。

Over 80 youth trainees complete foundation course of third phase of ROLE Stars Train-the-Leaders Programme (with photos),2025-07-12 17:16,2025-07-12 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071100589.htm,"Over 80 trainees from the district youth committees in the 18 districts and a local university today (July 12) completed the two-day foundation course titled ""Rule of Law Education (ROLE) Stars"" of the third phase of the ROLE Stars Train-the-Leaders (TTL) Programme organised by the Department of Justice (DoJ). The course aims to train people from various sectors in the community to become ROLE leaders through training on fundamental topics related to Hong Kong's rule of law and legal system, enhancing their capability in promoting the rule of law in the community on all fronts.

Following the first day of the course taught by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and member of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress and Member of the Legislative Council, Dr Starry Lee, last week, the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, elaborated on the second day of the course about the importance of promoting the rule of law, and the responsibilities and roles of ROLE leaders.

Member of the Working Group on Coordination and Liaison (Working Group) under the Steering Committee on Rule of Law Education (Steering Committee), Mr Chan Chak-ming, and member of the Steering Committee, Ms Sabrina Ho, briefed the trainees on topics such as the legal profession, court proceedings, and alternative dispute resolution services in Hong Kong. Founder and Chairperson of BExcellent Group, Dr June Leung, who has many years of experience in education, was also invited to share her insights on communication skills for effective dissemination of messages about the rule of law.

Dr Cheung remarked that the rule of law is Hong Kong's ""golden reputation"" and the foundation for Hong Kong to maintain long-term prosperity and stability under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". At the current critical period of breaking new ground and achieving another leap forward, the Hong Kong community must uphold the rule of law, and leverage Hong Kong's international advantages to promote high-quality development through the rule of law, and hence, the promotion of the rule of law is of great importance.

He said that members of the district youth committees have been promoting youth development and civic education in the community, and they can certainly play an important role in the promotion of the rule of law. University students who are pursuing their career in the education sector will be the backbone of schools' work in promoting rule of law education, and their active participation will undoubtedly provide new momentum to the passing on and further development of the rule of law in Hong Kong.

Dr Cheung said that communication is a kind of special knowledge. The DoJ designed the course with an emphasis on diversified, interactive and easy-to-understand methods, along with real-life examples and case studies, which enable trainees to easily grasp knowledge of the rule of law. The course also invited experts to teach trainees the skills of dissemination and communication, better equipping them to become ROLE leaders in the future.

After the course, the DoJ held the closing ceremony (including a certificate presentation) for the foundation course of the third-phase programme. Members of the Steering Committee, Ms Ho and Professor Dicky Tsang, and member of the Working Group, Mr Chan, presented certificates to the trainees who completed the two-day foundation course of the third-phase programme.

Looking ahead, the DoJ will continue to organise advanced and extended courses under the third phase of the TTL Programme. Through visits to law enforcement agencies, mock court activities, thematic talks on specific legal topics and practice activities for promoting the rule of law, the courses will further deepen the understanding of the legal system and the implementation of legal procedures of the trainees who have completed the foundation course, as well as bolster their confidence in disseminating messages of the rule of law in the community.

曾安業行政總裁（周大福企業聯席行政總裁及董事）、方圓明主席（凝動香港體育基金主席）、各位嘉賓、各位運動員、各位「共創明『Teen』計劃」的友師、學員、校友、各位觀眾朋友：

大家好！今日很開心來到啟德體藝館，與大家一同參與「師友同行活力匯聚挑戰賽」暨《邨JUMP!》冠軍爭霸戰這個別具意義的活動。

大家現在身處的啟德體藝館，是啟德體育園三個主要場館之一。如果是第一次到啟德體育園的朋友，我鼓勵你們在今日活動完結後，花一點時間到處參觀，欣賞這個世界級體育場地的同時，亦可在園內的購物中心和餐飲設施作休閒娛樂，感受這個香港新地標的活力。

不經不覺，「共創明『Teen』計劃」已經推行到第三期。這個計劃的成功，全賴政、商、民三方攜手合作。當中，不同企業和機構的支持至關重要。

在這裏，我要特別衷心感謝「周大福企業社會方案」一直鼎力支持「共創明『Teen』計劃」，連續三屆擔任計劃的合作夥伴委員會副主席，除了慷慨捐款外，亦推薦友師，與我們的學員並肩同行；並且為學員悉心籌辦團體活動。就好像今日，邀請第三期學員、友師及校友們一同參與豐富的運動體驗活動及觀賞精彩的籃球比賽，實在是難能可貴。

我亦要感謝各位友師，你們對計劃的大力支持和無私奉獻至為重要。今日你們抽出寶貴的周末時間，身體力行，陪伴及支持學員體驗運動的樂趣，擴闊他們的視野、建立自信和正面人生觀，對學員的成長實在是有非常大益處。很感謝你們。

今日活動的一大亮點，是稍後舉行的籃球表演賽。「共創明『Teen』計劃」校友會籃球隊的代表，會與專業的運動員以及一眾歌手朋友，組成「共創隊」和「明Teen隊」切磋球技。我頗喜歡這兩個隊名，相當不錯。

這幾年來，我一直見證着校友們的成長與進步。剛才我和曾先生及一些朋友與幾位校友聊天，發覺他們現在很有自信，也很有活力，實在非常開心。你們今天更代表校友會參與表演賽，實在令我感到很欣慰及驕傲。

今年十一月，我們將迎來第十五屆全國運動會。這項全國體育盛事首次由廣東、香港和澳門三地共同承辦，對於提升香港籌辦大型體育賽事、推動整個粵港澳大灣區體育產業發展，以及促進民心相通，都具有重要意義。當中亦有不少賽事會在這個全新的啟德體育園進行，希望大家屆時踴躍參加。

最後，我希望大家都能夠盡情投入今日大會精心為大家準備的精彩表演和賽事，盡情享受；亦祝願活動圓滿成功，各位身心康泰。多謝大家！"

Commissioner of Police encourages graduates to demonstrate team spirit (with photos),2025-07-12 14:21,2025-07-12 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071200372.htm,"The Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, inspected the passing-out parade of 43 probationary inspectors and 219 recruit police constables at the Hong Kong Police College today (July 12), and witnessed the graduates becoming members of the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), to jointly safeguard national security and protect the lives and property of citizens.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Chow said this was his first time attending the Police College passing-out parade in the capacity of the Commissioner of Police, and serving as the reviewing officer. He mentioned his participation in the parade as a graduate at the same venue 29 years ago, and hence could fully understand the feelings of the graduates.

He stated that the HKPF, with a history of 181 years, is a world-renowned, professional and highly efficient team. Over the years, the Force has encountered countless challenges, but has always overcome obstacles with team spirit, upholding the motto of ""Serving Hong Kong with Honour, Duty and Loyalty"", ensuring the safety and stability of Hong Kong.

He said that police officers have to serve in various posts throughout their career, and policing work requires concerted efforts to overcome adversities. Team members have to share weal and woe with each other and express care for their fellow colleagues; whereas team leaders win respect through personal integrity and take the initiative and stand at the forefront.

He shared that he had worked closely with a number of outstanding team members in his 30-year policing career. He stressed that team culture is indispensable and with great pride in HKPF, and since his appointment as the Commissioner of Police in April, one of his work priorities is strengthening the team culture.

 Mr Chow wished that graduates would stay in touch with their fellow classmates and peers from the same batches, to support and encourage each other, as well as bearing in mind that if each member goes the extra mile for the team, much more could be achieved. He also encouraged graduates to uphold their original aspiration when facing challenges ahead, and remember the steadfast support from their families, friends, colleagues, and the entire Force, and they are never fighting alone."
警務處處長寄語結業學員發揮團隊精神（附圖）,2025-07-12 14:20,2025-07-12 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071200371.htm,"警務處處長周一鳴今日（七月十二日）出席香港警察學院結業會操，檢閱43名見習督察及219名學警，見證他們正式成為警隊的一分子，共同守護國家安全，保護市民生命財產。

周一鳴致辭時表示，今次是他第一次以警務處處長的身分出席警察學院結業會操，並擔任檢閱官，而他29年前，在同一地點以畢業學員身分參與結業會操，因此能夠體會學員的心情。

他指警隊是一支擁有181年歷史世界聞名的專業高效能團隊，多年來遇過無數挑戰，但都能憑藉團隊精神，披荊斬棘，以「忠誠勇毅，心繫社會」的精神確保香港安全穩定。

他說，警務人員在警務生涯中會駐守不同崗位，警務工作講求合眾之力解難，互相照應，迎難而上。作為隊員，要休戚與共，關顧身邊同袍；作為隊長，更需展示以德服人、身先士卒的能力。

他分享其30年警務生涯有幸與很多優秀的隊友共事，合作無間。他強調，團隊文化是警隊不可或缺並引以為傲的一部分，而他在四月初接任處長一職，其中一個工作重點就是鞏固團隊文化。

周一鳴期望學員與同期、同班的隊友保持聯繫，互相扶持鼓勵，謹記每人為團隊多行一步，就可以走得更遠。他寄語學員日後即使面對不同挑戰亦要時刻保持初心，並記着有家人、朋友、同袍，以至整個警隊作為堅實後盾，並不是孤軍作戰。"
勞工及福利局局長就強制舉報虐待兒童和工業意外會見傳媒談話內容,2025-07-12 13:52,2025-07-12 14:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071200419.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（七月十二日）上午出席電台節目後，就強制舉報虐待兒童和工業意外會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：就剛才提及有關強制舉報虐兒的網頁，可否多說一些，例如何時會推出？

勞工及福利局局長：剛才所說為幫助專業人士更好地落實他們的法律責任，我們會在七月底作大型宣傳，然後開始培訓工作。網頁會在下年一月中相關條例正式生效後正式啓用，期間會做培訓。簡單而言，我們預期大家不需讀完像電話簿那麼厚的指南，只需答一些選擇題，可能十多條選擇題，就可以通過我們的程式告訴他們在法例下其個案是否需要作強制舉報。能做到這個我覺得是全世界首創的程式，是因為我們過去一段時間找了醫療、社福和教育三個界別的專家學者，再加上幾百位前線工作人員，將我們手上可以拿到的個案整理，然後變成一些舉報的邏輯，讓專業人士可以逐條問題作答。只要他回答的話，那個網頁，即是電腦程式，就會告知是否需要作強制舉報。如果要的話，程式會自動轉到強制舉報虐兒的網頁，方便他做事；如果不需要的話，會跟他說明不需要強制舉報，但他可以將資料打印出來看看。希望通過這個方法，能協助我們的專業人士切切實實地落實強制舉報虐兒的法律責任。

記者：局長，想問一下星期四發生的工業意外，目前初步看來有否違反紅色暴雨警告下進行工作的相關要求，或者有沒有遵守那些要求？現在天氣經常不穩定，勞工處可否再多做一些保障工人安全的工作，例如要求僱主施加措施保障工人安全？

勞工及福利局局長：在法律下，僱主有法定責任確保提供一個安全的環境予工人施工。尤其是在天氣不好的時候，譬如最近不幸發生的工業意外，如需在紅色暴雨警告下施工，就要加倍小心，並要做好預防措施。我們的調查也會沿着這方向去看，尤其是究竟僱主有沒有做足應有的防範措施以確保將意外風險減到最低。現在我們已經發出暫時停工通知書，即是該地盤的工序不准做了。我也藉這個機會向各位僱主呼籲，現在是夏天，比較多雨、多風，所以如果進行任何工序，尤其是戶外的，就要很小心。勞工處已有清晰的指引，當然也會針對風險加強巡查，及盡量將這些信息傳給相關人士。

記者：局長，想就強制舉報虐兒方面多問一些，你剛才說那個程式始終是電腦程式，怎樣確保建議舉報的界線不會太寬或太緊？另外電腦程式的建議其實有沒有法律效力，可否作為上庭辯解的原因？

勞工及福利局局長：整個安排有幾個原因，第一是想令大家因可以使用程式而感到安心；另外是提高了一致性，因獨自詮釋指南始終會不一致。在答相關選擇題的時候，不是隨便答A、B、C或D的，每一條答案裏面也有專業的註釋，說明如果選答A代表甚麼意思；答B代表甚麼情境；答C又是甚麼情境等。而且，我們會不斷修正程式，如出現新狀況而我們希望加入的話，好處在於加入新狀況後全部人都能跟着程式去做。我們參考過澳洲有類似的做法，但澳洲沒有我們做得那麼全面和深入。我們看到這個方法值得參考的，所以同事很好，既然看見好的方法，就在它的基礎上做得再全面、再深入。我不敢說全世界，但如果是以中文為界面的舉報機制，我們一定是首創的。我們會不斷做好，我們認為程式化能令舉報更加準確、更加確保不會有漏網之魚。至於辯解方面，大家可以放心，有了程式後，大家知道做完問卷便會很清楚得知是否需要舉報，對於專業人士來說，就很清楚知道自己是否已經符合法例的要求。

Remarks by SLW on mandatory reporting of child abuse and industrial accident,2025-07-12 13:52,2025-07-12 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071200420.htm,"âFollowing are the remarks by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, on mandatory reporting of child abuse and industrial accident at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (July 12):

Reporter: Secretary, can you also explain in English how the application for professionals on reporting suspected child abuse cases could properly guide them in knowing what to be reported and what not to be reported? And separately, on the industrial accident that happened two days ago, what is the investigation process right now, and any concerns regarding construction works under adverse weather?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you very much. Starting from mid-January next year, all the professionals covered by the law will be obliged to report serious child abuse cases. To help them discharge their legal obligations, we will soon launch training for them, so that they can make use of a tailor-made system which they can click into through the website by answering multiple choice questions. The system will at the end let them know whether the case is one that they have to report under the law, or is not a mandatory reporting case. I think the purpose is to make sure that all the professionals have peace of mind when comes to the obligations under the law. Through the system, instead of going through a very thick book of reporter guideline, they can just answer the questions. There will not be a lot of questions, just around ten or something more, and there will be a lot of notes to help them answer the questions. I think this may be the first of its kind in the world, if not for all languages, clearly for the Chinese language system. We will keep on improving the system.

As for the industrial accident happened two days ago, we are very concerned about this very serious incident. We have already issued a suspension notice, i.e. work is not allowed to be taken during the period when the notice is in force. At the same time, we are investigating the incident making sure that the employer is doing everything they could, to provide all the precautionary measures to make sure that workers who are undertaking work in inclement weather are adequately protected. We are moving along this direction. Thank you very much.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"

 Following its previous appearance in Australia in 2017, the HKCC commenced its concert tour in Hobart, Australia, where it participated as the guest choir at the ""Festival of Voices"" from July 3 to 7. The tour continued with a charity concert in Sydney on July 9, in support of CanRevive's cancer support service. The tour concluded in Auckland, New Zealand, with two performances: the ""Dreams to Dream"" concert yesterday (July 11) and the ""Echoes of Culture"" choral concert today (July 12).

  To mark the Sydney leg of the tour, the Sydney ETO hosted a pre-performance reception at Hong Kong House on July 9. About 100 guests from various sectors, including leaders from the local arts and cultural community, politicians and business leaders attended the event.

  In his welcoming remarks, the Director of the Sydney ETO, Mr Ricky Chong, welcomed the HKCC and highlighted the longstanding ties between Hong Kong and Australia. ""Events like these resonate far beyond the concert hall. They remind us that our relationships are not only built on trade and economic exchange, but also on shared values, artistic collaboration, and community spirit,"" he said.

  Mr Chong said that the National 14th Five-Year Plan has expressed clear support for Hong Kong to develop into an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. The Government is committed to further strengthening Hong Kong's role as Asia's events capital. ""With the official opening of the state-of-the-art Kai Tak Sports Park, we are welcoming a diverse array of large-scale international events, from major concerts and rugby matches to world-class football,"" he added.

  In celebration of the HKCC's debut visit to New Zealand, the Sydney ETO also hosted a pre-performance reception yesterday (July 11) ahead of the ""Dreams to Dream"" concert in Auckland, further fostering cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and New Zealand.

  Founded in 1969, the HKCC has grown into a diversified arts organisation for children. The HKCC has gained international acclaim for its performances and is widely recognised as one of the world's leading children's choirs."

繼二○一七年於澳洲演出後，香兒以澳洲霍巴特作為首站展開其巡演之旅，於七月三日至七日應邀擔任Festival of Voices音樂節的嘉賓合唱團。隨後香兒於七月九日在悉尼舉行慈善音樂會，為更生會的癌症支援服務籌款。其巡演之旅以新西蘭奧克蘭的兩場演出作結，包括昨日（七月十一日）的Dreams to Dream音樂會，以及今日（七月十二日）的Echoes of Culture合唱音樂會。

為紀念是次悉尼站的演出，悉尼經貿辦於七月九日在香港樓舉行演出前酒會。 約一百名嘉賓出席，包括當地文化藝術界和政商界領袖等。

悉尼經貿辦處長莊國民在酒會上致辭時歡迎香兒蒞臨澳洲，並強調香港與澳洲一直保持緊密而長遠的聯繫。他指，此類活動的意義遠超於音樂演出本身，證明香港和澳洲之間不但在經貿方面往來密切，更充分體現兩地在共同價值、藝術交流和社區聯繫等方面的深厚關係。

莊國民指，國家《十四五規劃綱要》明確支持香港發展成為中外文化藝術交流中心。香港特別行政區政府正積極鞏固香港作為亞洲盛事之都的地位。他說：「隨着世界級啟德體育園正式啓用，香港正迎來多項大型國際盛事，涵蓋音樂會、欖球比賽及世界級足球賽事。」

為慶祝香兒首次到訪新西蘭，悉尼經貿辦亦於昨日（七月十一日）在奧克蘭舉行Dreams to Dream音樂會前酒會，進一步促進香港與新西蘭之間的文化交流。

香兒於一九六九年成立，發展至今已成為多元化的兒童藝術機構，演出備受國際肯定，被譽為全球最傑出的兒童合唱團之一。"

Chairman Ngai (Council Chairman of City University of Hong Kong (CityU), Mr Michael Ngai), å±ç¸½ (Vice President and Chairman of the Group Technology Committee, Xiaomi Corporation, Mr Qu Heng), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my great pleasure to be in the CityU today for the opening ceremony of the ""City Quest å°‍åè¨"" programme.

Today, we gather here to mark the official launch of a visionary community engagement programme that embodies the spirit of ""tourism is everywhere"",ãé¦æ¸¯ç¡èä¸æéã. I was particularly impressed that this programme is inviting every member of the public to become a storyteller of our city through the ""hands"" by sharing personal narratives about Hong Kong, through the ""feet"" by becoming docent ambassadors and through the ""eyes"" by capturing the beauty of Hong Kong. This resonates with what I have been advocating ever since assuming the post as Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, which is ""Everyone is a tourism ambassador"", ãäººäººé½æ¯æéå¤§ä½¿ã.

With the travel patterns and traveller preferences progressing into more in-depth explorations, the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, as led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, with myself as Deputy Leader, has recently announced nine hotspot projects to offer new and more in-depth tourist experiences, with one project in Old Town Central and the other in Kowloon City. The Old Town Central project will take the Central to Mid-Levels Escalator as a conduit connecting various offerings in the vicinity to guide visitors to explore the beauty of our alleys and streets. On the other hand, the Kowloon City project features the ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition as the starting point to extend visitors' experience further in the district. Through these projects, we encourage visitors to experience Hong Kong's authentic local flavour from widened perspectives. I am confident that the ""City Quest"" programme will complement our hotspot projects to curate more fascinating experiences to a wider audience, thereby bringing more visitors to the unique beauty of Hong Kong.

Hong Kong is an international tourist city with significant advantages in developing city walk routes, with our diverse gourmet food, high accessibility and efficient transportation system. I wish the ""City Quest å°å‍è¨"" programme a success and would love to see more efforts of this kind from different stakeholders in the community in promoting the Hong Kong neighbourhoods.

Before I close, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to City University of Hong Kong and its partners for organising this meaningful programme to promote Hong Kong from fresh perspectives. Thank you very much."

Catherine (Chief Executive Officer of the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Ms Catherine So), Dr Lake Wang (Executive Director, People and Organisational Development of the Hong Kong Jockey Club), Tammy (Editor-in-Chief of the South China Morning Post, Ms Tammy Tam), Advisory Board members, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. And what a great morning this is for Hong Kong. Today, we celebrate our secondary schools and the exceptional professionalism and dedication of principals, teachers and support staff. We also thank parents for their endless support. And, most importantly, we honour the students among us today - the winners and finalists of this 44th annual Student of the Year Awards.

This year, over 840 students from 177 schools were nominated. And that, I'm delighted to say, is a new record high for the Awards.

Rewarding excellence is no easy task, yet Hong Kong is fortunate to have so many deserving students.

The judging panel had the tough task of bringing all those impressive nominations down to 40 finalists for the Awards' 10 student categories, including the Grand Prize.

The Government is firmly committed to youth development.

The Youth Development Blueprint for Hong Kong, released in late 2022, outlines our guiding principles for promoting long-term youth development. Its original 160-plus measures have been expanded, since then, to about 250, in an ongoing effort to ensure that the Blueprint evolves to meet the changing needs of our youth.

Our vision is to raise a new generation of youth instilled with a global perspective, a positive mindset and a deep love for our city and our country.

That demands a community-wide effort, including valued partnerships with organisations like the SCMP and the Jockey Club, working closely with educational institutions and families, to create an enabling environment for the youth of Hong Kong.

This year's theme, ""Building Tomorrow: Growth Through Action"", reflects that shared vision.

My congratulations to each and every one of this year's awardees and finalists. Remember, this city, together with your proud parents, your school, teachers and mentors, and so many others who have helped you along the way, believe in you and look forward to your future with great expectations.

I am grateful to the South China Morning Post and the Hong Kong Jockey Club for organising this prestigious event year after year and, in doing so, putting a brilliant spotlight on education, our youth and Hong Kong.

My thanks, too, to the Awards' judges, nearly 40 in all, for their invaluable time and expertise, and their compelling commitment to excellence.

醫務衞生局局長在南京出席第十三屆南京肝膽外科肝移植學術研討會（附圖）,2025-07-12 12:04,2025-07-12 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071100682.htm,"醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（七月十二日）出席於南京舉行的第十三屆南京肝膽外科肝移植學術研討會，與來自世界各地的肝移植專家分享香港在器官移植方面的最新發展和香港特別行政區政府（特區政府）與內地在器官捐贈及移植方面的合作。

盧寵茂教授在開幕式上致辭時說︰「香港和內地肝膽外科領域的合作由來已久，我亦親身見證了兩地專家攜手完成多例複雜肝移植手術、實現技術和資源的深度融合，這正好是『一國兩制』框架下醫療合作的良好示範。近年，香港與內地在器官捐贈與移植方面也有突破。二○二二年十二月及今年二月，兩例跨境心臟捐贈成功挽救兩名嬰兒的生命，充分體現內地與香港血濃於水、共同以生命至上的原則和信念拯救生命。隨着經驗累積，香港與內地有關緊急請求器官移植的渠道和流程已理順和規範化，特區政府會繼續探索將機制恆常化的安排。」

他亦分享香港防治肝病方面的最新情況。他說︰「自一九八八年開始，香港為所有新生嬰兒接種乙肝疫苗，大幅降低年青一代的感染率。行政長官在去年公布的《施政報告》中亦提出推行乙肝篩查以防治肝癌，若能及早識別患者，將有利於『早發現、早治療』，以減低患上併發症，包括肝硬化和肝癌的風險。」

研討會由江蘇省抗癌協會、江蘇省醫師協會和江蘇省醫學會聯合舉辦。會議雲集國際肝病專家和學者，以及來自世界各地的高級衞生官員。

盧寵茂教授隨後到江蘇省人民醫院（南京醫科大學第一附屬醫院）參觀，以及與該院院長劉雲教授交流和分享提升醫院管理和服務的經驗。他表示︰「醫院管理局（醫管局）正採納由深圳市衞健醫院評審評價研究中心制定的《國際醫院評審認證標準（中國）》（2021版）（《國際標準》），於轄下的公營醫院重啓醫院認證計劃，透過獨立的醫院認證專業機構，客觀地評估醫院在各方面的表現，藉此提升醫療機構的質素和保障病人安全。此外，醫管局亦按照國家認證標準於屯門醫院建設首間中風中心，以及分別於瑪麗醫院和威爾斯親王醫院建設胸痛中心，以優化相關的專科診症流程，改善治療效果，從而提升病人存活率。」

盧寵茂教授補充：「特區政府未來會繼續積極推動《國際標準》評審認證計劃以及胸痛中心和中風中心的建立，有關工作不單有助粵港澳大灣區醫療融合，令香港融入國家發展大局，亦能充分發揮香港『背靠祖國、聯通世界』的優勢，向國際社會展示國家醫院評審認證標準的卓越性。」

衞生署助理署長（藥物）陳凌峯、醫管局質素及安全總監黃立己醫生和港島西醫院聯網總監李德麗醫生陪同盧寵茂教授出席今日的活動。他們將於今日下午返港。"
Secretary for Health attends 13th Nanjing Academic Symposium on Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation in Nanjing (with photos),2025-07-12 12:04,2025-07-12 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/12/P2025071100679.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor LoChung-mau,attended the 13th Nanjing Academic Symposium on Hepatobiliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation in Nanjing today (July 12) to share with liver transplant experts from around the world Hong Kong's latest developments in organ transplantation, and the work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government in co-operation with the Mainland on organ donation and transplantation.

  In his address at the opening ceremony, Professor Lo said, ""Hong Kong and the Mainland have a long-standing collaboration in hepatobiliary surgery. I have personally witnessed experts from both places jointly performing a number of complex liver transplant surgeries, achieving in-depth integration of technology and resources, which is an exemplary model of medical co-operation under the 'one country, two systems' framework. In recent years, Hong Kong and the Mainland have also made breakthroughs in organ donation and transplantation. In December 2022 and February this year, two cases of cross-boundary heart donation successfully saved the lives of two infants, exemplifying to the fullest the inseparable ties between the Mainland and Hong Kong as well as our shared principle and mission in protecting and saving lives. With the accumulation of experience, the channels and procedures for handling urgent cross-boundary organ transplant requests have now been streamlined and standardised. The HKSAR Government will continue to explore arrangements for regularising this mechanism.""

  He also shared the latest developments in the prevention and control of liver disease in Hong Kong. He said, ""Since 1988, Hong Kong has provided universal hepatitis B vaccination for all newborns, significantly reducing infection rates among younger generations. As outlined in last year's Policy Address, the Chief Executive also proposed to implement hepatitis B screening to prevent liver cancer. If patients can be identified at an early stage, it will facilitate 'early identification and early treatment', thereby effectively reducing risks of developing complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer.""

  The conference was jointly organised by the Jiangsu Anti-cancer Association, the Jiangsu Medical Doctor Association, and the Jiangsu Medical Association. The conference brought together international experts and scholars in liver disease, as well as senior health officials from around the world.

  Professor Lo then visited the Jiangsu Province Hospital (the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University), where he exchanged views and shared experiences on enhancing hospital management and services with the President of Jiangsu Province Hospital (the First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University), Professor Liu Yun. He said, ""The Hospital Authority (HA) is adopting China's International Hospital Accreditation Standards (2021 Version) developed by the Shenzhen Hospital Accreditation Research Centre to resume the hospital accreditation programme at its public hospitals. Through independent professional hospital accreditation organisations, various aspects of hospital performance are assessed in an objective manner, with a view to enhancing the quality of healthcare institutions and safeguarding patient safety. Moreover, the HA seeks to optimise the diagnosis process of the relevant specialties and improve the treatment outcomes through the establishment of the first stroke centre at Tuen Mun Hospital, as well as chest pain centres at both Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital in accordance with national accreditation standards, thereby enhancing the survival rate of patients.""

  Professor Lo added, ""The HKSAR Government will continue to promote the accreditation programme under the Standards as well as the establishment of chest pain centres and stroke centres. These initiatives will not only improve healthcare integration within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and support Hong Kong's integration into national development, but also leverage Hong Kong's advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, so as to demonstrate the excellence of the national hospital accreditation standards to the international community.""

  The Assistant Director of Health (Drug), Mr Frank Chan; the Director (Quality and Safety) of the HA, Dr Michael Wong, and the Cluster Chief Executive of Hong Kong West Cluster of the HA, Dr Theresa Li, accompanied Professor Lo to attend today's functions. They will return to Hong Kong this afternoon."
