Water Supplies Department's clarification on water loss issue in Fairview Park,2026-02-08 23:57,2026-02-09 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800765.htm,"The Fairview Park Small Owners' Rights Association (""the Association"") today (February 8) issued a press release concerning water loss issue in Fairview Park. As the press release contains inaccuracies, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) provides the following clarification to avoid public misunderstanding:

The WSD has consistently discharged its regulatory and enforcement duties in accordance with the law in relation to the water loss issue in Fairview Park. As leakage was detected in the inside service of the Fairview Park, the WSD, pursuant to the powers conferred under section 7 of the Waterworks Ordinance, required the registered agent to follow up and rectify the problem. However, the Association has repeatedly and incorrectly attributed the responsibility for the inside service to the WSD, who is in fact the regulator, and has persistently requested the WSD to undertake the maintenance responsibility of the inside service of the housing estate, including detailed inspection and replacement of watermains. This misrepresentation is completely out of order.

Furthermore, clause 42 of the special conditions of Fairview Park's land lease only stipulates that the Government is responsible for maintenance of the water mains only if they were laid by the Government and are located beneath the roads which have been surrendered to the Government. In fact, the majority of the water mains within Fairview Park were laid by the grantee of the land and therefore the above-mentioned clause 42 is not applicable to these water mains. During the construction of Fairview Park, for the purposes of supplying water to the premises, the WSD only laid a small portion of water mains beneath the roads at the entrance and the areas within the housing estate near the entrance. These roads are still private land and have not been surrendered to the Government. Accordingly, under Section 7 of the Waterworks Ordinance and the land lease, the consumers or the registered agent shall be responsible for custody and maintenance of the water mains within Fairview Park. Despite WSD's repeated explanations, the Association continues to misinterpret the land lease provisions. The WSD urges the Association to cease disseminating inaccurate information.

To address residents' concerns and facilitate proper resolution of the water loss problem, the WSD has engaged an independent expert panel. Leveraging on the advanced technology and expertise, the expert panel will provide third‑party professional advice on the water loss issue, thereby assisting the responsible party of Fairview Park in effective planning of water mains repair works. The expert panel has commenced the work and aims to deliver preliminary findings by April. The expert panel is accountable to the WSD. Upon receipt its advice, the WSD will thoroughly consider the advice in order to plan for the follow-up actions, including providing appropriate technical support for the owners and the management office."
水務署就錦綉花園失水事宜作出說明,2026-02-08 22:10,2026-02-08 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800693.htm,"​錦綉花園小業主權益聯會（下稱「聯會」）今日（二月八日）就錦綉花園失水事宜發出新聞稿，內容有失實之處，水務署現作以下說明，以免「聯會」的公布引起公眾誤會：

水務署在錦綉花園失水事件上，一直依法履行規管及執法職責。由於發現屋苑內部供水系統出現滲漏，署方根據《水務設施條例》第七條賦予的權力，要求註冊代理人跟進處理。然而，「聯會」一再把擔當規管角色的本署，錯誤定性為責任方，並不斷要求署方承擔屋苑內部供水系統的保養維修責任，包括詳細檢查及負責更換水管等工程，實屬本末倒置之舉。

另外，錦綉花園地契特別條款第42條只是列明，倘若屋苑內部水管由政府鋪設，而水管位處的道路並已移交給政府，這些水管則由政府負責維修保養。惟事實上，錦綉花園範圍內大部分水管由土地承批人鋪設，因此並不屬上述地契特別條款的適用範圍。當年在建造錦綉花園時，為了達致供水給屋苑的目的，水務署只是在屋苑出入口及屋苑內鄰近出入口一帶的道路下鋪設小部分的供水喉管，上述道路至今仍屬私人土地，沒有移交給政府。換言之，現時錦綉花園內的供水喉管，根據《水務設施條例》第7條及根據地契，應由用戶或註冊代理人負責保管與保養。儘管署方已經再三說明以上情況，「聯會」仍然對錦綉花園地契作錯誤詮釋，署方希望「聯會」停止發放不實資訊。

為釋除居民的疑慮及讓失水問題盡快得以妥善解決，署方已委託獨立專家小組，利用前沿科技和專業知識，就屋苑失水問題提供第三方專業意見，從而協助錦綉花園責任方為喉管復修工程作出有效部署。專家小組已展開工作，爭取在四月有初步結果。小組直接向水務署負責，署方在接獲其意見後會詳細考慮，以便部署跟進工作，包括為業主及管理公司提供適切的技術支援。"

During the operation, the enforcement officers conducted test-buy operations and suspected that five mobile hawkers were visitors taking up employment or establishing or joining in business in Hong Kong. The five mobile hawkers were subsequently arrested by immigration officers on suspicion of being illegal workers. The arrested illegal workers were five women, aged 20 to 40.

Customs, the ImmD and the Police will continue to step up high-profile patrol and enforcement to resolutely combat different kinds of illegal activities in the vicinity of the event venues during mega events.

Customs reminds consumers to purchase goods at reputable shops and to check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt. Traders should be cautious and prudent in merchandising since the sale of counterfeit goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions. Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any goods with a forged trademark commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Under the Copyright Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any infringing goods commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $50,000 per infringing copy and imprisonment for four years.

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-08 17:30,2026-02-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800493.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 8), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。​


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；

CHP reminds public not to consume raw oysters and observe food safety as two more food poisoning clusters involving raw oyster consumption reported,2026-02-08 13:45,2026-02-08 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800382.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (February 8) investigating two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters affecting a total of five persons. The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

New food poisoning clusters
------------------------------------

The clusters involve two males and three females aged between 30 and 38. They developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever about 14 to 49 hours after having dinner at Chef's Cuts located at Unit 229 and 230, 2/F, THE SOUTHSIDE, 11 Heung Yip Road, Wong Chuk Hang, on January 30.

Three of the affected persons sought medical advice but did not require hospitalisation.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that raw oyster was the food item that the affected individuals had in common at the aforementioned restaurant. Officers of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) conducted an investigation at the restaurant and the raw oyster suppliers Jeton International Food and 88 Investment Holdings Limited. The CFS immediately instructed Jeton International Food and 88 Investment Holdings Limited to suspend the sale and supply of raw oysters, and issued press release on the follow-up actions on February 6, instructing the trade should stop selling raw oysters supplied by the company concerned immediately if they possess them. All of the newly reported cases consumed raw oysters concerned before preventive and control measures instituted by the CFS.

The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

Recent surge in norovirus-related food poisoning cases
------------------------------------------------------------------

""Food poisoning cases have continuously increased over the past few weeks, rising from one case a week on average in late December last year to four cases a week on average in January. A total of 27 cases have been recorded in the first week of February. Over the past three weeks (between January 18 and February 7), the CHP has recorded 34 food poisoning cases, affecting 108 persons. Among which, 30 cases (88 per cent) were related to norovirus, affecting 94 persons. Epidemiological investigation showed that all the affected persons of the food poisoning cases related to norovirus had consumed raw oysters during the incubation period. Among the affected persons, five persons were hospitalised for treatment. All are in stable condition. The CHP has notified the CFS on all the food poisoning cases for follow up,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""As oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater, pathogens can accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Raw and partially cooked oysters are considered a high-risk food. Persons who consume undercooked or contaminated oysters may contract food-borne diseases such as norovirus, hepatitis A virus or other bacteria. In view of the drastic increase in food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters recently, members of the public, especially pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, shall stay vigilant and avoid consumption of raw oysters or partially cooked bivalve shellfish to prevent infection,"" Dr Tsui explained.

""In addition to food poisoning, norovirus can also cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE). According to the CHP's surveillance data, the AGE activity level has continued to increase since early January, including AGE outbreaksin institutions and schools. Laboratory testing indicated that over 60 per cent of the outbreaks were caused by norovirus.In addition, there have been increases in the norovirus activity in other popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, including Japan and Korea. Members of the public should remain vigilant and maintain personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of being infected while travelling,"" Dr Tsui added.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------------

Norovirus infection typically causes food poisoning and AGE with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, low-grade fever and malaise. The symptoms are usually self-limiting and most people will get better within one to three days.

In general, norovirus is more active in winter (around December to March). As norovirus is highly contagious, individuals may become infected after being exposed to even a small amount of norovirus. The virus can be transmitted through various means, such as eating contaminated food, contacting with the vomit or excreta of infected persons, and contacting with contaminated objects. In settings where people are staying close together such as schools, elderly homes etc., there is a possibility of a large-scale outbreak.

""As the Lunar New Year holiday is approaching, members of the public have more opportunities to have parties with food delivery services or hotpot. To prevent food poisoning, apart from maintaining personal hygiene, they should also consume thoroughly washed and cooked food. For shellfish, the shells should be well scrubbed and the internal organs be removed before consumption. To prevent AGE and norovirus infection, members of public should perform hand hygiene frequently, especially before handling food or eating, and after using the toilet. Wash hands with liquid soap and water, and rub for at least 20 seconds, then rinse with water and dry with a disposable paper towel or hand dryer. Since alcohol is not effective in killing norovirus, alcohol-based handrubs are not a substitute for handwashing with soap and water,"" said Dr Tsui."

衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「過去數周錄得的食物中毒個案持續增加，由去年十二月底每周錄得平均一宗個案，上升至上月每周平均四宗，二月第一周更急增至27宗個案。過去三周（一月十八日至二月七日）已錄得34宗食物中毒個案（共影響108人），當中30宗（88%）與諾如病毒相關（共影響94人）。流行病學調查發現上述與諾如病毒相關的食物中毒個案的受影響人士全部在潛伏期內曾食用生蠔。受影響人士當中，有五人須留院治理，全部情況穩定。衞生防護中心已將全部食物中毒個案通知食物安全中心作出跟進。」

徐樂堅醫生解釋：「由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有病原體，這些物質便會在蠔的體內積聚。生或未徹底煮熟的蠔是高風險食物，進食受污染及未經煮熟的蠔，可能感染經由食物傳染的疾病，例如諾如病毒、甲型肝炎病毒或其他細菌。鑑於近日與進食生蠔相關的食物中毒個案大幅上升，市民應提高警覺，盡量避免進食生蠔或未徹底煮熟的雙殼類海產，尤其是孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者，以預防受到感染。」

   徐樂堅醫生續說：「除了食物中毒，諾如病毒亦是引致急性腸胃炎的主要原因之一。我們的監測指標顯示本地急性腸胃炎的活躍程度自一月初起持續上升，包括院舍及學校的急性腸胃炎爆發個案，實驗室的檢測顯示超過六成是諾如病毒引致。此外，其他香港人的旅遊熱點近日的諾如病毒活躍程度亦持續上升，包括日本及韓國。市民外遊時要提高警覺，注意個人、環境及食物衞生，以減低受感染的風險。」

市民應採取預防措施

諾如病毒常引致食物中毒及急性腸胃炎，症狀包括噁心、嘔吐、腹瀉、腹痛、輕微發燒及不適。大部分患者一般會自行痊癒，症狀通常在一至三天內有所改善。

一般來說，諾如病毒在冬天（約十二月至三月期間）較為活躍。由於病毒具高度傳染性，受影響人士即使接觸少量病毒，亦有機會受感染。病毒可透過進食受污染的食物、接觸受感染人士的嘔吐物或排泄物，及接觸受污染的物件等不同途徑傳播，在人多聚集的地方，如學校、安老院舍等，有機會導致大規模爆發。

徐樂堅醫生說：「農曆新年假期將至，市民較多機會舉行派對安排食物到會或火鍋，要預防食物中毒，除了注意個人衞生，所有食物亦必須徹底清潔並煮熟後方可食用；處理貝類海產時，須洗淨外殼並去除內臟，才可進食。要預防急性腸胃炎及諾如病毒感染，必須經常保持雙手清潔，尤其在處理食物或進食前及如廁後。洗手時應以梘液和清水清潔雙手，搓手最少20秒，用水過清並用抹手紙或乾手機弄乾。由於酒精未能有效殺死諾如病毒，酒精搓手液不能代替使用梘液和清水潔手。」"
再次錄得涉及進食生蠔的食物中毒個案群組    衞生防護中心提醒市民避免進食生蠔及注意食物安全,2026-02-08 13:30,2026-02-08 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/08/P2026020800356.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心今日（二月八日）正調查兩宗有流行病學關連的食物中毒個案群組，共涉及五人。衞生防護中心呼籲市民保持個人、食物及環境衞生，預防經由食物傳播的疾病。

新增食物中毒個案群組
——————————

受影響的兩男三女年齡介乎30歲至38歲。他們於一月三十日在黃竹坑香葉道11號THE SOUTHSIDE二樓229及230鋪一間名為Chef's Cuts的食肆晚膳後，約14至49小時先後出現腹瀉、腹痛、嘔吐和發燒等病徵。

其中三名受影響人士已求醫，無須入院。全部受影響人士現時情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，受影響人士於上述食肆進食的共同食物為生蠔。食物環境衞生署（食環署）人員（包括食物安全中心和環境衞生部人員）早前已到涉事餐廳及生蠔供應商傑頓國際食品及88投資控股有限公司（Jeton International Food and 88 Investment Holdings Limited）調查。食物安全中心在調查後已經即時指示供應商傑頓國際食品及88投資控股有限公司暫停出售及供應生蠔，並在二月六日發出有關跟進工作的新聞稿，指示業界如持有該公司供應的生蠔，應立即停售。所有新呈報的個案，均在食物安全中心採取防控措施前進食有關生蠔。

衞生防護中心及食物安全中心的調查仍然繼續。
