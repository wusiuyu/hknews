21名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-08-08 16:43,2025-08-08 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800601.htm,"21名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於八月一日及今日（八月八日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款共88,100元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 143宗個案，而就法庭已處理的803宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及696名分間單位業主，罰款介乎400元至41,600元，合計總罰款共2,104,910元，另有340宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該21名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；（二）要求租客付還經分攤的水及／或電費時沒有出示繳費單副本及提供書面帳目；及（三）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。其中一名業主觸犯上述（一）項共16宗罪行而被判處罰款16,000元。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

21 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-08-08 16:43,2025-08-08 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800609.htm,"  Twenty-one landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7), pleaded guilty and were fined a total of $88,100 on August 1 and today (August 8) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 143 cases to date. Among the 803 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 696 SDU landlords with fines ranging from $400 to $41,600, amounting to a total of $2,104,910. In addition, 340 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 21 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; (2) failing to produce copies of the bills and provide an account in writing when requiring the tenant to pay for the reimbursement of the apportioned water and/or electricity charges; and (3) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance). One of the landlords committed 16 offences under (1) and was fined $16,000.

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon an in-depth investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to facilitate SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance.

A male passenger, aged 20, arrived in Hong Kong from Lisbon, Portugal, via Paris, France, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the suspected cocaine, camouflaged as a cheese wheel and weighing about 7.7kg, in his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (August 9).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666.

財經事務及庫務局局長在浦銀環球財富管理平台啓動儀式致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-08 15:20,2025-08-08 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800323.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（八月八日）在浦銀環球財富管理平台啓動儀式的致辭全文：

賈紅睿行長（上海浦東發展銀行（浦發銀行）香港分行行長、浦銀國際執行董事）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今天，我非常榮幸受邀參加浦銀環球財富管理平台啓動儀式，並為大家致辭。我謹祝賀浦發銀行，期望您們不斷優化平台服務，貢獻香港資產及財富管理業的發展。

特區政府發展資產及財富管理業的策略有三大重點，包括（一）不斷做大資產管理規模，為香港在各項國際研究中「拼排名」；（二）加強與內地及粵港澳大灣區合作，擴大香港市場覆蓋面；及（三）通過政策及項目創新提升市場競爭力。

憑藉健全的監管框架、創新的金融政策以及廣泛的全球金融網絡，香港作為國際金融中心的地位始終穩固。通過政府與業界共同努力，我們做大資產管理規模「拼排名」的工作已經取得實際成果。截至二○二四年年底，香港的資產及財富管理業務總值超過35萬億元，按年增長百分之十三，淨資金流入更急升百分之八十一。私人銀行及私人財富管理業務的增長特別亮麗，管理資產按年增長百分之十五至10.4萬億元。今年六月，香港的私募基金管理資本額已突破2,374億美元，在亞洲排名第二，僅次於內地。

此外，根據最新的《全球金融中心指數》報告，香港在「投資管理」及「融資」領域位列全球第一，充分展現其作為國際投資者首選的亞洲財富管理中心地位。依據行業統計，香港同時也是亞洲最大的對沖基金中心，並預計在未來數年內成為全球最大的跨境財富管理中心。在大家的共同努力下，我熱切期待這天的到來。

要保持業務持續增長的動力，加強與內地及粵港澳大灣區合作，擴大香港市場覆蓋面至關重要。《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》明確支持香港作為國際金融中心、全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐、國際資產管理中心及風險管理中心的地位，並致力打造大灣區綠色金融中心以及服務「一帶一路」建設的投融資平台。在跨境金融服務方面，香港已取得顯著成果，其中包括跨境開戶服務及跨境理財通的發展等。

截至今年六月，香港銀行提供超過360個見證開戶服務網點，協助香港居民開設逾43萬個內地銀行賬戶。我們將持續推動進展，適時與內地監管當局探討增加參與銀行的可能性。

此外，跨境理財通（粵港澳大灣區跨境理財通）允許香港、澳門及廣東省內九市居民跨境投資大灣區內的理財產品。我們將持續優化相關措施，豐富投資選擇，促進三地金融市場的互聯互通，協助業界拓展商機，充分發揮跨境理財通的潛力，並鞏固香港作為國際資產管理中心的地位。截至今年六月，參與跨境理財通的個人投資者已超過16萬人，跨境匯劃金額突破1,100億元人民幣。

在「一國兩制」的框架下，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，結合成熟的金融基建和自由流通的資本，成為財富擁有人尋求投資機遇的首選地點。作為全球最大的離岸人民幣業務中心，香港的互聯互通機制助力全球投資者通過香港投資內地市場。未來我們將通過各項政策及項目創新，不斷提升市場競爭力。

在銷售網絡及渠道方面，香港已經與內地及其他市場達成基金互認安排，共有81個基金獲兩地監管機構認可，累計淨認購額超過1,200億元人民幣。與此同時，內地與香港基金互認安排獲進一步優化，包括放寬互認基金客地銷售比例限制，並允許香港互認基金將投資管理職能轉授予與管理人同集團的海外資產管理機構，顯著提升基金產品的多樣性及銷售規模。

家族辦公室業務方面，我們的目標是於今年年底前，協助不少於200間家族辦公室在港設立或擴展業務，構建全球家族辦公室和資產擁有人的蓬勃生態圈。根據目前進度，我們不單會達到目標，更將會超額完成。

去年我們與彭博（彭博有限合夥企業）合作推出「香港家辦匯」計劃，聚焦四大範疇，即家族辦公室生態圈建設、行業知識分享、資訊科技支持以及慈善倡議。此外，我們今年三月舉辦了第三屆「裕澤香江」高峰論壇，以「香港——為全球，向世界」為主題，匯聚全球精英，彰顯香港作為環球家族辦公室樞紐的獨特魅力。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，香港憑藉其獨特優勢、戰略地位、穩健的金融生態系統以及全球連繫，持續鞏固其國際金融中心的領先地位。浦銀環球財富管理平台的啓動，是充分運用這些優勢、提供創新財富管理解決方案的重要一步。我衷心祝願浦發銀行此項目取得圓滿成功，並期待見證這一平台為香港乃至全球金融服務作出卓越貢獻。謝謝大家！"
New arrangement on queue ticketing for direct issue of Hong Kong Full Driving Licence/Temporary Driving Licence from August 13,2025-08-08 15:15,2025-08-08 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800518.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (August 8) that new queue ticketing requirements will be imposed on agents submitting applications for the direct issue of Hong Kong Full Driving Licence/Temporary Driving Licence at the Hong Kong Licensing Office (HKLO) at United Centre, Admiralty, starting from August 13, ensuring fair use by the public.

  Currently, applicants for ""direct issue"" may submit application documents at the counter via making online appointments or obtaining same-day queue tickets at the HKLO. To combat soliciting activities for agent services and disruption of public order after obtaining queue tickets, from August 13, apart from inputting the first four digits/letters of their identification document (ID) number (e.g. K123) into the queue ticketing system, all agents appointed to submit ""direct issue"" applications are also required to input the ID number of each of the respective applicants when obtaining a ticket. Such information will be printed on the ticket. When using counter services, counter staff will verify the ID numbers of both the ticket holder and the applicant(s) entered. If any information does not match that printed on the ticket, the ticket will be voided. All applications concerned will not be processed, and no replacement tickets will be issued.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""We have been very concerned about the queue ticketing situation at Licensing Offices and online appointments for counter services, and have adopted targeted measures to ensure licensing services are used by members of the public in need in a fair and orderly manner. The HKLO has further stepped up staff patrols to maintain the queuing order, specified the sequence of tickets for 'direct issue' on the queue barriers to prevent queue-jumping, and enhanced the queue ticketing system to strengthen verification of queuers' identity to curb the transfer of tickets. The new arrangement aims to further deter individuals from soliciting business with tickets obtained. Any acts disrupting public order will be reported to the Police for follow-up.""

  In addition, the TD will strengthen co-operation with relevant issuing authorities of driving licences and plans to check applicants' information in relation to Mainland driving licences provided via online appointments starting from September. If any information is found to be untrue, the relevant appointments will be cancelled, and such quotas will be reopened for appointment by other applicants, thereby enhancing the effective operation of the system.

  The TD will introduce the new arrangement to the public through on-site notices and staff, the website and social media, keep reviewing the effectiveness of the measures, and make timely adjustments. It will continue to promote digitalisation of licensing services so that more counters can be redeployed for processing applications necessitating handling at the counter, such as the ""direct issue"". As for general driving licensing-related counter services, their queue ticketing arrangements remain unchanged."
​男子因進口未完稅香煙及利用經更改車輛為走私用途罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-08-08 15:06,2025-08-08 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800338.htm,"一名三十二歲男子因進口未完稅香煙及利用經更改車輛為走私用途，違反《應課稅品條例》和《進出口條例》，八月六日在西九龍裁判法院被判罪成，兩項控罪各被判監禁四個月，同期執行。

香港海關透過風險評估及情報分析，於二○二四年六月十二日，在港珠澳大橋香港口岸截查一輛報稱空載的入境私家車。經查檢後，海關人員在私家車的車門、中控台、車尾及車底加裝的暗格內共檢獲三萬零八百支未完稅香煙，遂拘捕該名男司機。涉案私家車亦被檢取。案中檢獲的香煙，估計市值約十八萬元，應課稅值約十萬元。

海關歡迎裁決，認為監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬及監禁兩年。

此外，走私屬嚴重罪行，根據《進出口條例》，任何人為走私用途而更改車輛，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

海關會繼續嚴厲執法，打撃跨境走私活動。

市民如發現懷疑私煙活動，可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報。"
Man convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and making use of altered structure of vehicle for purpose of smuggling articles (with photos),2025-08-08 15:06,2025-08-08 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800339.htm,"A 32-year-old man was convicted at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on August 6 for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and making use of an altered structure of a vehicle for the purpose of smuggling articles, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO). He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment for each of the charges that will run concurrently.

Through risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Hong Kong Customs intercepted an inbound private car, declared to be empty, at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port on June 12, 2024. Upon inspection, Customs officers seized a total of 30 800 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes from the doors, console box, the rear and a compartment installed underneath the vehicle. The male driver was subsequently arrested and the private car was also seized. The estimated market value of the cigarettes seized in the case was about $180,000 and the duty potential was about $100,000.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Moreover, smuggling is a serious offence. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of making use of the altered structure of a vehicle for the purpose of smuggling articles is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Customs will continue to combat cross-boundary smuggling activities with firm enforcement action.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

現時，免試簽發申請人可經網上預約或在香港牌照事務處領取即日籌，經櫃位遞交申請文件。針對部分人士在領取即日籌後招攬代辦服務並影響現場秩序，由八月十三日起，所有獲委託遞交申請的代辦在領取即日籌時，除須於系統輸入其個人身分證明文件號碼首四位數字或字母（如K123）外，亦須同時輸入各名免試簽發申請人的身分證明文件號碼首四位數字或字母，有關資料會列印於其籌號。當使用櫃位服務時，櫃位人員會核對籌號持有人及申請人身分證明文件號碼。如任何資料與籌號所印不符，該籌即告無效，所有申請一概不獲受理，亦不會補發籌號。

運輸署發言人說：「我們一直非常關注牌照事務處輪候取籌及網上預約櫃位服務的情況，並採取針對性的措施確保有需要市民公平和有序地使用牌證服務。香港牌照事務處已派員加強巡查維持輪候取籌的秩序，並於圍欄上標示輪候籌號次序以防止插隊，並提升派籌系統以加強核對身分阻截籌號轉讓。新安排旨在再進一步遏止憑籌號招攬生意的情況。如發現有人影響公共秩序，會交警方跟進。」

此外，署方將與有關駕駛執照簽發機構加強合作，包括計劃由九月起查核經網上預約提供的內地駕駛證的申請人資料。如發現資料不真確，有關預約將會取消，名額會重新開放予其他申請人預約，提升系統有效運作。

署方會透過現場告示和人員、網頁、社交媒體等向市民簡介新安排，並持續檢視措施的成效，適時調整；同時繼續推動牌證服務電子化，從而調動更多櫃位辦理如免試簽發等必須經櫃位處理的申請。至於一般駕駛執照相關櫃位服務，取籌和輪候安排維持不變。"

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-08-08 12:11,2025-08-08 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800352.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-08 06:46,2025-08-08 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/08/P2025080800159.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 8) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

"Government continues to strengthen efforts in mosquito control and elimination, publicity and education in view of imported chikungunya fever cases (with photos)",2025-08-07 22:45,2025-08-08 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700846.htm,"To ensure effective implementation of measures reducing the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF), the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), together with relevant government departments and stakeholders, continue to strengthen efforts in mosquito control and elimination, publicity and education. In response to the imported CF cases announced yesterday (August 6), the Acting Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, and Assistant Director of the FEHD Mr Peter Poon today (August 7) visited several places, including the area outside of Mount Haven in Tsing Yi North, Kwai Tsing District, to review the immediate response measures in the area to reduce the risk of secondary spread of CF. They also visited Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan District to learn more about the specific follow-up actions of various government departments and stakeholders to mitigate mosquito infestation.

 Meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts were held in July to formulate strategies and operations with relevant government departments and stakeholders. During today's visit, the EEB and the FEHD reminded all relevant departments to step up efforts in mosquito control and elimination, publicity and education amidst the recent rainy weather. In addition, the Panel on Food Safety and Environmental Hygiene will discuss preventive and control measures against mosquitoes and CF on August 12. The Government will take into consideration views from stakeholders and residents in its future measures. The FEHD and the Property Management Services Authority will jointly hold a large-scale seminar for the property management sector on August 19. The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health and the FEHD will provide participants with the latest information on CF and details of measures on mosquito control and elimination.

 Two of the imported cases announced yesterday travelled to Bangladesh and developed symptoms there. They returned to Hong Kong on August 3. Both patients live in Kwai Tsing District. The survey area in Tsing Yi North, where their residence is located, recorded a gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes of 15.5 per cent in July this year, which is at Level 2 alert level, indicating a fairly extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In response to the imported cases, the FEHD has immediately commenced vector investigations and targeted mosquito control within 250-metre radius of their residence. Measures include removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and conducting ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes. In addition, the FEHD, jointly with other stakeholders including the Housing Department, District Council members, Community Care Teams and property management companies, held a health talk this morning to answer the residents' enquiries.

 The FEHD staff, representatives of housing estates, persons in charge of nearby hillside construction sites, and related pest control service contractors also provided detailed information on the actions taken and the ongoing work for mosquito control and prevention in public places, housing estates and construction sites. Furthermore, the FEHD convened a meeting of the inter-departmental task force on anti-mosquito work in Kwai Tsing District on July 28. Members of the task force include relevant departments and stakeholders and they will continue to collaborate and carry out related work.

 The FEHD has also been closely monitoring mosquito infestation situations in various districts. The gravidtrap index in the survey area of Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan District was 24.4 per cent in July this year, reaching a Level 3 alert level, indicating an extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. A meeting of the inter-departmental task force on anti-mosquito work in Tsuen Wan District was held by the FEHD on July 24. Members of the task force include relevant departments and stakeholders. Targeted and sustained mosquito prevention and control operations at high-risk locations have been carried out based on the gravidtrap index in Ma Wan at the time.

 The EEB, the FEHD, the District Officer (Tsuen Wan), Mr Billy Au, representatives of related departments, housing estates, theme park, Rural Committees and community members have been conducting joint inspections in areas under their purview to strengthen mosquito prevention and control work. This includes eliminating mosquito breeding places, applying larvicides, conducting fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes, and ensuring that mosquito trapping devices at appropriate locations are operating properly. Various parties and residents are willing to co-operate and provide support. With the concerted efforts of all parties, the situation of mosquito infestation in the survey area improved in the second half of July compared to the first half.

 In recent months, the district offices of FEHD continue to work closely with relevant departments and stakeholders to strengthen inspections, particularly targeting construction sites and locations with higher mosquito infestation risks. Actions include strengthening the clearance of stagnant water and the application of larvicides such as temephos sand granules to stagnant water cannot be cleared immediately, as well as conducting ultra-low volume fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes. Through publicity and educational work, the FEHD, relevant departments and stakeholders continue to appeal to members of the public to inspect and remove stagnant water at home to prevent and control mosquito infestation.

 In addition to the inspections mentioned above, the FEHD staff, along with related departments and stakeholders, will conduct inspections at different places (including Southern District on Hong Kong Island and Kai Tak North in Kowloon City) today and tomorrow to follow up on related works.

 The effectiveness of mosquito control relies on the concerted efforts and active participation of stakeholders from various sectors, including pest control operators in both public and private sectors, venue management and the general public, to prevent CF."

In response to the imported CF cases announced yesterday (August 6), the Acting Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, and Assistant Director of the FEHD Mr Peter Poon today (August 7) visited several places, including the area outside of Mount Haven in Tsing Yi North, Kwai Tsing District, to review the immediate response measures in the area to reduce the risk of secondary spread of CF. They also visited Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan District to learn more about the specific follow-up actions of various government departments and stakeholders to mitigate mosquito infestation.

 Meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts were held in July to formulate strategies and operations with relevant government departments and stakeholders. During today's visit, the EEB and the FEHD reminded all relevant departments to step up efforts in mosquito control and elimination, publicity and education amidst the recent rainy weather. In addition, the Panel on Food Safety and Environmental Hygiene will discuss preventive and control measures against mosquitoes and CF on August 12. The Government will take into consideration views from stakeholders and residents in its future measures. The FEHD and the Property Management Services Authority will jointly hold a large-scale seminar for the property management sector on August 19. The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health and the FEHD will provide participants with the latest information on CF and details of measures on mosquito control and elimination.

 Two of the imported cases announced yesterday travelled to Bangladesh and developed symptoms there. They returned to Hong Kong on August 3. Both patients live in Kwai Tsing District. The survey area in Tsing Yi North, where their residence is located, recorded a gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes of 15.5 per cent in July this year, which is at Level 2 alert level, indicating a fairly extensive distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In response to the imported cases, the FEHD has immediately commenced vector investigations and targeted mosquito control within 250-metre radius of their residence. Measures include removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and conducting ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes. In addition, the FEHD, jointly with other stakeholders including the Housing Department, District Council members, Community Care Teams and property management companies, held a health talk this morning to answer the residents' enquiries.

 The FEHD staff, representatives of housing estates, persons in charge of nearby hillside construction sites, and related pest control service contractors also provided detailed information on the actions taken and the ongoing work for mosquito control and prevention in public places, housing estates and construction sites. Furthermore, the FEHD convened a meeting of the inter-departmental task force on anti-mosquito work in Kwai Tsing District on July 28. Members of the task force include relevant departments and stakeholders and they will continue to collaborate and carry out related work.

CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today (with photos),2025-08-07 20:12,2025-08-07 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700703.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 7) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the CF case in recent days. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of four CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers. The Port Health Division staff members conducted inspections yesterday (August 6) and today respectively at the Lok Ma Chau Control Point and in the vicinity of the Hong Kong International Airport Ground Transportation Centre, and reminded the cross-boundary coach companies operators and the Airport Authority Hong Kong to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and remind residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. As of yesterday, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH has incorporated information of CF prevention into 296 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The CHP today issued another letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong regarding CF to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel to affected areas. If there are suspected CF cases, they should immediately refer the patients to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures. Moreover, for patients with typical clinical symptoms of CF, irrespective of their travel history, doctors should consider to arrange testing based on clinical judgment.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The CHP recommends that the public properly use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients to effectively prevent mosquito bites. The following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has intensified anti-mosquito measures at the residence of the confirmed patients and the locations visited after the onset of illness. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces as well as removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and alsoMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案（附圖）,2025-08-07 19:22,2025-08-07 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700655.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月七日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得四宗基孔肯雅熱個案，全部為輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

衞生署已加強對不同群組有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作。中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並向旅客派發宣傳單張。港口衞生科人員昨日（八月六日）及今日分別到落馬洲出入境管制站及香港國際機場地面運輸中心附近範圍視察，並提醒跨境巴士公司營辦商及機場管理局加強防控蚊患措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。截至昨日，衞生署長者健康服務外展分隊已在296個為長者及照顧者提供的健康推廣活動加入預防基孔肯雅熱的資訊。此外，長者健康服務亦安排在十八區的長者健康中心派發相關的單張，讓長者了解其症狀及加強防患基孔肯雅熱的意識。家庭健康服務亦在轄下的母嬰健康院提醒孕婦及嬰幼兒照顧者有關預防基孔肯雅熱的注意事項。學生健康服務會在轄下的學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心向學生派發宣傳單張，讓他們了解基孔肯雅熱的症狀。

中心今日亦再次就基孔肯雅熱去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意從受影響地區外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現懷疑病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。此外，對於出現基孔肯雅熱典型臨床症狀的患者，不論是否有旅行史，醫生應根據臨床判斷考慮安排檢測。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食物環境衞生署（食環署）已加強確診病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪地點的防蚊滅蚊工作。同時，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

本屆論壇在今年十一月於巴西貝倫召開的第三十屆聯合國氣候變化大會前夕舉辦，將探討如何在創造和改善就業的同時，擴大私營部門投資、加速亞太新興市場綠色轉型、推動氣候創新、應對極端天氣情況和保護生物多樣性。涵蓋的重要議題包括，人工智能與其他新興技術和創新在能源轉型中的應用、重工業減碳、可持續供應鏈、為生物多樣性與氣候適應提供融資方案、以及亞太地區能源轉型投資的最新趨勢。

國際金融公司亞太區域副總裁里卡多·普利蒂（Riccardo Puliti）表示：「亞太地區的新興市場已經充分意識到，引領、制定並投資本土氣候解決方案至關重要。同時，他們也意識到，與私營部門攜手合作，充分調動資本和技術創新，是實現智慧發展的關鍵動力。」

為期一天的論壇將包括主題演講、高級別小組討論及爐邊對話等，匯聚企業領袖、金融機構、開發組織與政策制定者。論壇亦將重點介紹具有變革性的合作項目，包括由國際金融公司發起以支持女性企業家和女性領導的企業積極推動氣候相關解決方案的倡議——女性氣候先鋒（She Wins Climate）；及由金管局與國際金融公司在亞洲合作推動的綠色商業銀行聯盟的最新進展。

反非法勞工行動拘十四人（附圖）,2025-08-07 18:58,2025-08-07 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700647.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）近日展開一項反非法勞工行動，在行動中一共拘捕十四名人士，包括十二名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

入境處執法人員早前跟進調查在港逾期逗留人士時，懷疑他們留港期間在港從事非法工作。經深入調查及情報分析後，入境處於昨日（八月六日）採取執法行動，突擊搜查一個位於元朗區的物流倉庫。連同早前被捕的逾期逗留人士，共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為八男四女，年齡介乎二十四至五十三歲。他們均涉嫌於該物流倉庫從事搬運、包裝及裝卸貨物等工作。當中三名男子亦涉嫌管有懷疑偽造身份證，另外一名女子則涉嫌管有他人身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩名香港居民男子，年齡分別為四十六及五十歲。行動中亦檢獲懷疑非法勞工的出勤紀錄、薪酬記錄、手提電腦及包裝工具。入境處將對非法勞工提出檢控，並繼續調查涉案僱主，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
14 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operation (with photos),2025-08-07 18:58,2025-08-07 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700648.htm," The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted an anti-illegal worker operation recently. During the operation, 14 persons were arrested, namely 12 suspected illegal workers and two employers.

 During follow-up investigations of overstayers in Hong Kong earlier, the ImmD investigators suspected that these overstayers were engaged in illegal work during their stay in Hong Kong. After an in-depth investigation and intelligence analysis, the ImmD conducted an enforcement operation yesterday (August 6), raiding a logistics warehouse located in Yuen Long District. Together with the previously arrested overstayers, a total of 12 suspected illegal workers and two employers were arrested. The arrested illegal workers comprised eight men and four women, aged 24 to 53. They were all suspected of engaging in various logistics tasks, including handling, packaging, and unloading goods at the logistics warehouse. Among them, three men were also suspected of being in possession of forged Hong Kong identity cards, while one woman was suspected of possessing an identity card related to another person. Two men, aged 46 and 50, were Hong Kong residents suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. During the operation, attendance records, payroll records, a laptop, and packaging tools of the illegal workers were also seized. The ImmD will lay charges against the arrested illegal workers while the cases involving the employers remain under investigation. The ImmD does not rule out the possibility of further arrests.

 An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

 The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

 The spokesman emphasised that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

 According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman reminded all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

   Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

Speech by SCST at opening ceremony of ASEAN Film Festival 2025 (English only),2025-08-07 18:38,2025-08-07 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700643.htm," Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the opening ceremony of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Film Festival 2025 today (August 7):

Deputy Director Liu Guangyuan (Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Deputy Commissioner Pan Yundong (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR), Consul-General Ong (Dean of ASEAN Consuls-General in Hong Kong, Consul-General of Singapore in Hong Kong, Mr Ong Siew Gay), Deputy Director Wan Ning (Deputy Director-General of the Youth Department of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR), Chairman Daryl Ng (Chairman of Hong Kong-ASEAN Foundation), Commissioner Nicholas Ho (Commissioner for Belt and Road), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is my pleasure to join you at the opening ceremony of the ASEAN Film Festival 2025.

Tonight, we come together to celebrate the transformative power of film - an art form that transcends borders, connects diverse cultures, and tells stories that resonate with people from all walks of life. This year's festival offers a curated lineup of over 20 acclaimed films, bringing remarkable stories from Southeast Asia to the Hong Kong audience. For the very first time, the festival also features outstanding works from four Belt and Road countries - Egypt, Hungary, Kazakhstan, and Türkiye - further enriching this cultural showcase. 

This festival serves as a unique platform for dialogues and collaborations. I'm pleased to see filmmakers, directors, and actors from some 10 featured films participating in special sharing sessions, engaging with local youth and ASEAN students in Hong Kong. There will also be two collaborative talks between ASEAN and Hong Kong filmmakers, bringing in insightful cross-cultural discussions, paving the way for new ideas and partnerships.

Such cultural exchange activities align perfectly with our strategic vision to establish Hong Kong as a leading East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Moreover, the activities also underscore Hong Kong's steadfast dedication to strengthening connections with countries along the Belt and Road region, solidifying its role as the ""super-connector"" between the Mainland of China and the global community.

Creative industries are vital drivers of our economy, and the Hong Kong film industry stands as a flagship of our creative industry. I am sure many of you have grown up watching at least one or two Hong Kong films, enjoying TVB dramas, or listening to Canto pop hits. These treasures are truly some of the valuable cultural assets of Hong Kong that we are so proud of.

The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is committed to promoting the development of Hong Kong's film industry. Recently, we have launched the Film Production Grant Scheme for Promoting Chinese Culture, encouraging Hong Kong film directors to incorporate Chinese cultural elements into film productions. We also encourage Hong Kong filmmakers to collaborate with European and Asian filmmakers through the Hong Kong-Europe-Asian Film Collaboration Funding Scheme. Furthermore, Hong Kong film programmes are organised regularly in different countries to showcase Hong Kong's cinematic brilliance and to foster cultural exchange and collaboration. These efforts aim not only to bring diverse cultures to Hong Kong but also to share the richness of Chinese culture with the world.

Before I close, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Hong Kong-ASEAN Foundation for organising this wonderful event that furthers regional cultural exchange. I wish the ASEAN Film Festival 2025 every success and all of you an inspiring and enjoyable evening. Thank you very much."

Fresh beef sample found to contain sulphur dioxide,2025-08-07 18:32,2025-08-07 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700650.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (August 7) that a fresh beef sample was found to contain sulphur dioxide, a preservative which is not permitted to be used in fresh meat. The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS, under its routine Food Surveillance Programme, took the fresh beef sample from a fresh provision shop (FPS) on Reclamation Street, Yau Ma Tei, for testing. The test result showed that the sample contained sulphur dioxide at a level of 557 parts per million. The CFS is following up with the FPS concerned about the irregularity.""

According to the Preservatives in Food Regulation (Cap. 132BD) (the Regulation), it is an offence to add sulphur dioxide to fresh or chilled meat. The maximum penalty is a $50,000 fine and six months' imprisonment.

Sulphur dioxide is a preservative which can be used in a variety of foods including dried vegetables, dried fruits, pickled vegetables and salted fish products, but under the Regulation it is not permitted in fresh or chilled meat. Individual meat traders have been found illegally using sulphur dioxide to make meat look fresher. Sulphur dioxide is water-soluble, and most of it can be removed through washing and cooking. However, susceptible individuals who are allergic to this preservative may experience breathing difficulties, headaches and nausea after consumption.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to comply with the law and not to sell fresh or chilled meat adulterated with sulphur dioxide. Members of the public should purchase meat from reliable market stalls or FPSs. They should avoid buying or consuming meat which is unnaturally red, and maintain a balanced diet to avoid malnutrition or excessive exposure to chemicals from a small range of food items.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."
新鮮牛肉樣本含二氧化硫,2025-08-07 18:31,2025-08-07 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700649.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（八月七日）公布，中心在一個新鮮牛肉樣本檢出不可在新鮮肉類中使用的防腐劑二氧化硫，正跟進事件。

中心發言人說：「中心透過恆常食物監測計劃，從油麻地新填地街一新鮮糧食店檢取該新鮮牛肉樣本進行化驗。結果顯示，樣本含百萬分之五百五十七的二氧化硫。中心正與涉事新鮮糧食店跟進有關違規事項。」

根據《食物內防腐劑規例》（第132BD章）（《規例》），在新鮮及冰鮮肉類中添加二氧化硫屬違法，最高可判罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。

二氧化硫是一種防腐劑，可用於乾菜、乾果、醃菜和鹽醃的魚製品等不同種類的食物，但根據《規例》不得用於新鮮或冰鮮肉類。個別販商為使肉類色澤更鮮明，會違法在肉類中添加二氧化硫。二氧化硫可溶於水中，清洗和烹煮可除去食物中大部分二氧化硫。不過，對二氧化硫有過敏反應的人，在食用後可能會出現氣喘、頭痛或噁心等徵狀。

發言人提醒業界必須遵守法例規定，不可售賣摻雜二氧化硫的新鮮及冰鮮肉類。市民則應向可靠的街市檔戶或新鮮糧食店購買肉類，切勿購買或進食顏色異常鮮紅的肉類，同時需注意均衡飲食，因為偏食可引致營養不良或攝取過多的化學物。

中心會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

A male passenger, aged 37, arrived in Hong Kong from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected ketamine and suspected nicotine-containing pouches in two of his check-in suitcases, while the alternative smoking products were found in his carry-on luggage. He was subsequently arrested. An investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance, any person who possesses any poison included in Part 1 of the Poisons List other than in accordance with provisions commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
