CFS to follow up certain batches of powdered infant and young children formula with possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus,2026-01-10 22:48,2026-01-10 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000853.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (January 10) said that, it took initiative to meet with Nestlé Hong Kong again today, and confirmed the company's today announcement of an additional batch of powdered infant and young children formula suspected to have possibly used the raw material concerned. Nestlé Hong Kong has voluntarily stopped sales, removed from shelves the affected products and has initiated a precautionary recall. The CFS has collected samples of powdered infant and young children formula from the market for Bacillus cereus testing, the test results so far were satisfactory. The Environmental and Ecology Bureau is also closely monitoring the supply situation of other formula milk powder and maintaining communication with other major suppliers. It is noted that there is sufficient formula milk powder to meet the demand.

The spokesman said, the CFS has been actively following up on Nestlé company's voluntary and precautionary recalls of certain batches of its powdered infant and young children formula in certain areas in Europe due to possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus in the individual raw material. According to the latest information from Nestlé Hong Kong today, an additional batch of its powdered infant and young children formula imported into Hong Kong might have used the raw material concerned. The CFS had earlier enhanced surveillance in the market and collected a sample from the above batch for testing of Bacillus cereus. The test result of the sample was satisfactory. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure, Nestlé Hong Kong has voluntarily stopped sales, removed from shelves the affected products and has initiated a precautionary recall.

Product details are as follows:

Product name (Net weight): NAN PRO 1 2 HMO (800g)
Batch number: 51670742F2
Best-before date: June 16, 2027
Place of Origin: Germany

""The CFS met Nestlé Hong Kong again today, urging them to properly handle the product recall issue and respond to public enquiries, in order to safeguard consumers' legitimate rights and interests. In addition, the CFS and Nestlé Hong Kong have jointly followed up, six suspected affected batches of infant and young children formula products that had not entered the market were marked and sealed. An additional 15 batches are currently en route to Hong Kong and will also be marked and sealed upon arrival. The CFS will continue to closely monitor the recall matters and remain fully committed to ensuring food safety, "" the spokesman said.

Nestlé Hong Kong has initiated a recall of the affected batches of the products concerned. For enquiries about the recall, members of the public may contact the company through the following channels:

Consumer services hotline: 2599 8874 / 2797 6031/ 2179 8136 (Monday to Sunday, 9am to 9pm)

The CFS, through its Food Incident Surveillance System, noted earlier that certain batches of Nestlé powdered infant formula were being voluntarily recalled in Europe due to possible contamination with Bacillus cereus. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS has immediately initiated follow up actions, published food incident posts to inform the public and the trade about the issue, and has been actively following up on the incident and enhanced surveillance.

Over the past three days (as of 4pm on January 9), the FEHD received a total of 18 food complaints and enquiries suspected to be related to the infant and young children formula products, including one anonymous complaint without contact information. The CFS and the Environmental Hygiene Branch have promptly followed up on all cases, including contacting the parties concerned to obtain details and collecting samples for testing. In addition, the CFS has referred the cases to the health department for follow-up. At present, no food poisoning cases related to the formula have been recorded.
    
Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

The spokesman urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the affected batches of the products, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the products concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of the products immediately.

""The CFS continues to closely monitor the developments of the situation, follow up and take appropriate action,"" the spokesman said."
食安中心跟進個別批次嬰幼兒配方奶粉可能存在源自微生物蠟樣芽孢桿菌的物質,2026-01-10 21:19,2026-01-10 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000796.htm,"​食物環境衞生署（食環署）食物安全中心（食安中心）今日（一月十日）表示，今日再次主動約見雀巢香港，確認雀巢香港今日公布另一個批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉懷疑可能曾使用相關原材料後，已自願將受影響產品停售和下架，並展開預防性的回收。食安中心至今在市面抽檢嬰幼兒配方奶粉的樣本作蠟樣芽孢桿菌（Bacillus cereus）檢測，結果皆為滿意。環境及生態局亦繼續密切留意其他配方奶粉的供應情況，與其他主要供應商保持溝通，知悉配方奶粉足以應付需求。

發言人指，食安中心持續積極跟進雀巢公司在歐洲部分地區自願預防性回收個別批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉，因為個別原材料可能存在源自微生物蠟樣芽孢桿菌的物質。根據雀巢香港今日的最新資料，另有一個批次進口本港的嬰幼兒配方奶粉懷疑可能曾使用相關原材料。食安中心早前在市面加強抽檢，並抽取了上述批次的樣本作蠟樣芽孢桿菌檢測，該樣本的檢測結果為滿意。雖然如此，為審慎起見，雀巢香港已自願將受影響產品停售和下架，並展開預防性的回收。

產品資料如下：

食安中心早前透過食物事故監測系統，得悉雀巢公司在歐洲自願回收部分批次的雀巢嬰兒配方奶粉，因為懷疑個別產品可能受到蠟樣芽孢桿菌污染。食安中心得悉事件後，已即時作出跟進，並發布食物事故報表，讓公眾和業界知悉有關事件，並一直積極跟進事件和在市面加強抽檢。

過去三日（截至一月九日下午四時），食環署共接獲十八宗懷疑與嬰幼兒配方奶粉產品有關的食物投訴和查詢，當中包括一宗並沒有提供聯絡資料的匿名投訴。食安中心及環境衞生部已即時跟進全部個案，包括聯絡當事人以了解詳情，並收取樣本作檢測。此外，食安中心已轉介這些個案予衞生部門作跟進，現時沒有錄得與奶粉有關的食物中毒個案。

蠟樣芽孢桿菌普遍存在於環境中。如製作或貯存食品的過程欠缺衞生，可引致該菌繁殖。致吐毒素是由一些蠟樣芽孢桿菌菌株在食物中產生的耐熱毒素。進食含過量蠟樣芽孢桿菌或其耐熱毒素的食物，可能引致腸胃不適，例如嘔吐及腹瀉。

發言人呼籲市民不要讓嬰幼兒食用受影響批次的產品，如發覺嬰幼兒食用有關產品後不適，應盡快求醫。業界亦應立即停止使用或出售受影響批次產品。

發言人說：「食安中心繼續密切留意事態發展並跟進和採取適當行動。」"

Hospital Authority proactively assists patients and majority of medical fee waiver applications approved on same day,2026-01-10 19:40,2026-01-10 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000696.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

Following the implementation of public healthcare fees and charges reform, the Hospital Authority (HA) has enhanced its medical fee waiver mechanism to facilitate applications from patients with financial needs, strengthening protection for underprivileged and elderly patients. The HA spokesperson announced today (January 10) that the HA proactively assists eligible citizens in obtaining medical fee waivers before accessing medical services. The HA currently has processed an average of 5 000 medical fee waiver applications daily. According to approval records, approximately 85 per cent of applications are successfully approved on average, with some hospital clusters reaching nearly 90 per cent, and waivers are issued on the same day. For patients who are unable to provide all required documents at the time of application, ""conditional waivers"" can be issued within as quickly as 15 minutes, allowing immediate access to fee reduction. This ensures that no patient is denied from medical care due to lack of means.

The HA reported that 54 658 medical fee waiver applications have been approved to date, including 33 759 cases have completed assessment and received formal waiver certificates. Under normal circumstances, waivers will be issued within approximately one hour of submitting all required documents. For patients who require urgent medical services but are unable to provide the necessary documentation for financial assessment, the HA has exercised flexible arrangements. By signing a declaration stating their financial situation meets the medical fee waiver eligibility criteria, patients can receive approval for ""conditional waivers"" within as fast as 15 minutes. The HA has exercised flexible arrangements to approve 20 899 ""conditional waivers"". These patients must submit the relevant documents for financial assessment within three months. If patients fail to submit the required documents within the deadline or do not meet the eligibility criteria, they will be required to settle all applicable fees (if any).

""Patients should allow sufficient time for medical fee waiver applications. For patients without immediate medical needs, it is advisable to begin the application process approximately one to two months before their scheduled appointments. Members of the public can also access information about medical fee waivers, including application procedures and required documents, in advance through the HA website or mobile application HA Go. They can also use the means test calculator to preliminarily evaluate their eligibility, ensuring a smoother application process,"" the HA spokesperson reminded.

The spokesperson emphasised that the enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism is a crucial measure of the public healthcare fees and charges reform to strengthen protection for patients facing financial hardship, and therefore requires financial assessment and not everyone will be eligible. Each application must be handled with due diligence for the use of public money. Patients have the responsibility to provide complete, accurate, truthful, and appropriate information for assessment and verification, ensuring that assistance reaches those truly in need.

While ensuring that no patient is denied from medical care due to lack of means, it is also essential to uphold the principle of prudent use of resources to prevent the limited and precious public resources being abused. Moreover, the supporting documents required for medical fee waiver applications are similar to those required for other social welfare or government subsidy schemes.

Patients need to submit income and asset proof documents for financial assessment while applying for medical fee waivers. In addition to common documentary proof such as land or non-owner-occupied property, cash in hand, bank savings, investments in stocks and shares, some applicants may keep cash in other accounts such as e-wallets, Hong Kong Jockey Club betting accounts, or have accessible insurance savings. Patients are also required to provide relevant supporting documents for these assets to accurately assess their eligibility for medical fee waivers. To ensure appropriate use of medical resources and prevent abuse, the HA will conduct regular reviews of approved cases randomly.

The HA has relaxed eligibility criteria and simplified the application procedures with the implementation of enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism. Patients or their family members who are currently receiving Old Age Living Allowance may be exempted from submitting certain documentary proof for financial assessment, with details as follows:


For a two-member family where both members receive Old Age Living Allowance, the patient only needs to provide proof of receiving the allowance (such as bank statements) and will be exempted from submitting income and asset proof;
For a two-member family where one member receives Old Age Living Allowance, provision of income proof will be exempted; and
For a one-member family where the applicant receives Old Age Living Allowance, provision of asset proof will be exempted.


Furthermore, if a patient has household members included in the financial assessment who already possess approved medical fee waiver, the patient will not need to undergo a complete financial assessment. The HA will refer to the financial information submitted during their household member's medical fee waiver application and, depending on the actual circumstances, will only request necessary or missing information from the patient rather than conducting a full review from scratch. The patient will receive a waiver with the same validity period as their household member.

The HA is gradually enhancing its electronic system ""Medical Fee Assistance Domain"" (the domain) to support medical fee waiver applications. Patients can now upload required documents for financial assessment through the domain, receive push notifications about key application status, and check application details. Starting from the second quarter of 2026, patients will also be able to submit applications through the domain."

何芷韻主席（保良局主席）、林承毅副主席（保良局副主席）、各位嘉賓、各位青年朋友、各位來到V Mart與大家一起歡度這個開幕禮的嘉賓：

大家好。今日我很高興可以出席由康樂及文化事務署（康文署）與保良局攜手呈獻的V Mart維園市集開幕典禮，和大家一齊見證這個洋溢創意與活力的嶄新市場正式揭幕。

V Mart是發展旅遊熱點工作組公布的九個重點旅遊項目之一。這九個項目分布於港九新界，涵蓋歷史建築活化、海濱休閒體驗、夜間經濟及文創市集等不同範疇，不單令香港的旅遊景點更加豐富、多元化，亦有助推動本地深度遊、活化我們的社區空間和展示香港的獨特魅力。V Mart是其中一個以文化帶動社區旅遊的關鍵項目，將有近七十年歷史的維多利亞公園轉化成為充滿現代創意的空間，讓市民與旅客在這片市區綠洲之中，悠然感受貼地的生活氣息與藝術氛圍。

V Mart自剛過去的十二月十二日開始試業，之後每逢星期六、日及公眾假期均會舉行，預計運作會有約一年的時間至今年十一月底。市集有超過三十個精選攤位和工作坊，網羅本地文創產品、手作工藝、原創藝術與潮流特色小食飲品等等，檔主中不乏首次參與市集的本地新晉設計師、藝術家或社會企業，他們通過各式各樣的原創產品，以獨特視角詮釋我們香港的本土文化。市集除配合不同節慶與主題推出多元化的活動，亦設有多個「打卡」位，為本地市民及旅客帶來新鮮的市集體驗。此外，市集亦將會劃出寵物友善的區域，歡迎市民攜同你們的貓貓、狗狗一同到訪，享受你們的共融樂趣。

V Mart已開展了接近一個月，人流暢旺，檔主和參觀者的反應都非常正面。有檔主表示，V Mart營運合理，有利於創業或推廣多元化的產品；至於到訪人士亦普遍覺得市集有新意，更有光顧小食檔的長者表示嚐到他們「小時候的味道」。

V Mart由康文署與保良局攜手合辦。保良局是政府的長期合作夥伴，一直積極服務社會及推動社區發展。我們期望今次跨界別協作，可以將歷史悠久的維多利亞公園轉化為展現不同主題的市集，既為社區注入新動力，亦展現出香港中外文化薈萃、傳統與現代交融的獨特魅力。希望市民及各地旅客都可以在V Mart找到你們喜歡的本地特色創意產品，在車水馬龍的銅鑼灣鬧市中享受嶄新的休憩和休閒空間。

最後，在此祝願V Mart圓滿成功、人氣旺盛，成為香港旅遊和文化的新亮點。現在距離農曆新年還有一個多月，我先在此向大家拜個早年，祝大家馬年身體健康、事事順心，並祝各位檔主生意興隆、貨如輪轉、盆滿缽滿，多謝大家。"

記者：剛才局長在致辭提及，希望導師們要多些培養或提高國安意識，現在已做了一段時間，去到甚麼程度？還有現在可見不停有policy（政策）推出，例如工會不能接受外部勢力捐款，有沒有多些資料，或者怎樣去check（檢查）？

政制及內地事務局局長：今日我參加這個畢業典禮（國際公益法律服務協會國家安全教育中心第七期及第八期國家安全教育（導師培訓）證書課程畢業典禮）很開心，看見不單政府很努力地推廣維護國家安全的工作，也看見民間或其他社會各界都非常支持進行各種形式維護國家安全的推廣和教育工作。這些我們覺得單憑政府的努力去做是不足夠的，必須由整個社會，大家各界齊心合力，維護國家安全才會做得好。正如剛才我所說，這是我們的責任，亦是我們的義務。希望透過社會各界共同努力，大家在維護國家安全方面的工作可以做得更好，可以令國安工作更加牢固。

記者：今年是「十五五」規劃第一年，香港在哪方面可多做一點或具體一點？因為剛才有提及要融入國家發展。

政制及內地事務局局長：正如習主席在行政長官述職中提出了要求，我們必須主動對接「十五五」規劃，就這方面政府在未來的工作上，必定會加大工作。「十五五」規劃綱要即將出台，我們會全方面進行對接，一方面促進香港本身的自身發展，同時亦要助力國家的高質量發展。這一點是今年特區政府相當重要的工作。

記者：國安是否其中一個focus（焦點）？

政制及內地事務局局長：正如剛才所說，國安工作並沒有完成式，永遠都是進行式。無論是國安教育或維護國安的工作，這方面都是恆常要進行，不斷要加強的工作。謝謝。"
醫管局積極協助病人 大部分申請即日獲批減免,2026-01-10 17:43,2026-01-10 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000645.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）在公營醫療收費改革實施後，同時推行優化醫療費用減免機制，方便有經濟需要的病人申請醫療費用減免，加強對貧困或長者病人的保障。醫管局發言人今日（一月十日）表示，醫管局積極協助合資格市民於使用醫療服務前獲得減免證明書。醫管局近日每日平均接獲約5 000宗醫療費用減免申請，根據批核紀錄，平均約八成五申請個案成功獲批減免，部分聯網接近九成，並可於即日獲發醫療費用減免證明書。如果病人於申請時未帶齊所需文件，最快可於約15分鐘獲發「有條件減免」醫療費用減免證明書，可即時使用減免醫療費用，確保病人不會因為有經濟困難而未能接受適切的醫療服務。

醫管局表示，至今已批出54 658宗醫療費用減免申請，包括33 759宗已完成評核及批出減免證明書。一般情況下，病人只需交齊文件，大約一小時內可完成辦理申請手續獲發減免證明書。病人如果未能提交所需證明文件進行經濟審查但急需使用醫療服務，醫管局亦會彈性處理，病人只需簽署聲明書聲明經濟狀況符合減免資格，最快亦可於15分鐘內獲批「有條件減免」申請。醫管局已彈性批出20 899宗「有條件減免」醫療費用減免證明書，這些病人必須在三個月內補交相關文件作經濟評估。如病人未能於限期內提交文件或未符合相關申請資格，屆時必須清繳所有應繳費用（如有）。

醫管局發言人提醒：「病人需預留足夠時間申請醫療費用減免申請，如果病人未有即時醫療需要，可以在覆診期前預留約一至兩個月時間開始辦理申請手續。市民亦可預先透過醫管局網頁或HA Go了解醫療費用減免的相關資訊，包括申請手續及需要備妥的文件，以及使用經濟審查計算程式，初步自行評估是否合乎申請資格，確保申請過程更順暢。」

發言人又重申，優化醫療費用減免機制是公營醫療收費改革中加強保障經濟有困難病人的重要措施，故需要經濟審查，而非任何人皆符合資格。由於涉及公帑運用，必須審慎處理每個申請，病人亦有責任提供完整、準確、真確及合適的資料，以供評估和核對，讓真正有需要的病人獲得援助。

在確保不會有市民因為經濟困難而未能接受合適醫療服務的同時，亦必須秉持審慎運用資源的原則，讓有限及珍貴的公共資源不被濫用。此外，申請醫療費用減免所需提交的證明文件，亦與申請其他社福或政府資助計劃類似。

病人於申請時需要提交入息及資產證明文件以評估其經濟狀況，除了較常見的土地、非自住物業、現金、銀行儲蓄、股票及股份投資等證明文件外，由於有部分申請人可能將現金存放於其他戶口，例如電子錢包、香港賽馬會的投注戶口，或擁有可動用的保險儲蓄，因此申請時亦會要求病人提供有關證明文件，以準確評估病人是否符合資格申請醫療費用減免。為了確保醫療資源運用恰當，並防止被濫用，醫管局會隨機覆查已批核的個案。

醫管局於推行優化醫療費用減免機制時，除了放寬申請資格外，申請手續已有所簡化。如果病人或家人正領取長者生活津貼，可獲豁免提交部分證明文件作經濟審查，詳情如下︰


二人家庭，如二人均領取長者生活津貼，病人只需提交領取長者生活津貼的證明（例如銀行月結單），便可豁免提交入息及資產證明；
二人家庭，如其中一人正領取長者生活津貼，可豁免提交入息證明；及
一人家庭，如申請人正領取長者生活津貼，可豁免提交資產證明。


除此之外，如病人有同住而被納入經濟評估的家庭成員持有有效的醫療費用減免證明書，病人可毋須再進行全面經濟審查，醫管局會參考其家庭成員申請醫療費用減免時所提交的財務資料，並按實際情況只要求病人提供必要或有所欠缺的資料，而毋須逐一從頭審查，而獲得有效期與該家庭成員相同的減免。

醫管局正逐步提升電子系統「醫療費用援助一站通」以支援醫療費用減免申請，病人現時可透過「醫療費用援助一站通」平台上傳經濟審查所需文件，接收申請關鍵進度推送通知及查閱申請詳情；而於二○二六年第二季起，病人更可於平台自助辦理申請。"

何君堯議員、各位導師、各位學員、各位嘉賓：

大家下午好！十分榮幸今天獲邀出席由國際公益法律服務協會轄下的國家安全教育中心所舉辦的第七期及第八期國家安全教育（導師培訓）證書課程畢業典禮。

首先，我謹祝賀各位學員順利完成課程。作為國家安全教育導師，你們將肩負着引導市民加強認識國家安全以及積極推廣國家安全教育的重任。我對大家都是寄予厚望，期待與你們一起共同提高香港市民各界的國家安全意識和愛國情懷，令大家可以自覺堅定地維護國家安全、愛護祖國。

國際公益法律服務協會由何君堯議員在二○一八年創立，一直堅決擁護《憲法》、《基本法》和《香港國安法》。協會在二○二○年開辦國家安全教育中心，一方面着力推動《基本法》第二十三條的立法工作，同時不斷培訓國家安全教育認可導師，至今已培育了超過430名合資格、有信心、有能力、有熱誠的國家安全教育導師。導師們在各中小學、社區、制服團隊及社會機構授課，向市民講解國家安全的必要性及各項與國家安全相關的法例，切實提升市民對國家安全的認識。我對何議員、協會、中心以及各導師們多年來的無私奉獻和不懈努力以及所作出的貢獻表示衷心的感謝。

誠然，香港今天堅定地維護國家安全和維持社會穩定的局面實在是來之不易。二○一九年「黑暴」肆虐，中央果斷出手實施《香港國安法》，迅速有效止暴制亂，並填補了香港在國家安全法律方面多年來的真空。二○二四年三月，《維護國家安全條例》更獲立法會全票通過，完成了特區《基本法》第二十三條立法的憲制責任和歷史使命。現時，特區的國家安全已經得到全面有效的保障，而《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》更為香港的長期經濟繁榮發展提供了最堅實的基礎和保障。

二十大報告中指出，「國家安全是民族復興的根基，社會穩定是國家強盛的前提。」維護國家主權、安全、發展利益是「一國兩制」方針的最高原則，更是每一個中國人的應有之義，是我們的共同義務和責任。

「黎智英案」審訊期間，外部敵對勢力一直嘗試抹黑攻擊特區政府，而潛逃海外的反中亂港分子在外部勢力的包庇下更是不斷試圖作出種種危害國家安全的行為和活動。此外，外部勢力和其代理人更死心不息，不斷透過「軟對抗」等手段試圖煽動市民對中央和特區政府的憎恨。此等情況在在都反映我們仍然面對着國家安全的風險，絕對不能掉以輕心。而黎智英的定罪亦正好說明，任何意圖破壞國家安全團結、繁榮進步的圖謀都將不會得逞，亦絕不會成功，更絕對阻礙不了國家的強國之路和民族復興之途。

各位，維護國家安全只有進行時，沒有完成時。國家安全，人人有責。當今世界變亂交織，單邊霸凌行徑嚴重衝擊國際秩序。此時此刻，我們更加須要堅定信心、團結一致，發揚鬥爭精神，增強鬥爭本領，堅定有力地維護國家安全，居安思危，加強國家安全教育，防範、制止和懲治任何試圖危害國家安全的行為和活動，確保國家安全的牢固。

在座各位學員均是任重而道遠，我期望繼續與協會及各位一同齊心協力，切實履行香港特區維護國家安全的憲制責任，以高水平的國家安全護航國家的高質量發展，確保「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠，為國家的強國建設和民族的偉大復興作出新的更大貢獻！

二○二六年伊始，我謹祝願大家在新的一年事事順利、身體健康、家庭幸福！

多謝大家！"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-10 17:30,2026-01-10 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000627.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 10), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-10 17:30,2026-01-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000625.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​​​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
​一名入境旅客進口未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2026-01-10 16:00,2026-01-10 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000555.htm,"一名入境旅客因進口未完稅香煙及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（一月十日）在九龍城裁判法院被判處監禁六個月和罰款一千元。

海關人員昨日（一月九日）在香港國際機場截查一名四十三歲抵港女旅客，並在她的個人行李內檢獲四萬八千四百支未完稅香煙，市值二十一萬七千八百元，應課稅值約十六萬元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-01-10 16:00,2026-01-10 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/10/P2026011000560.htm,"​An incoming passenger was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts today (January 10) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming female passenger, aged 43, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (January 9), and seized 48 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of $217,800 and a duty potential of about $160,000 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
