"Property owner fined over $180,000 for not complying with removal order ",2025-12-10 11:00,2025-12-10 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000221.htm,"âA property owner was convicted and fined $186,400 in total, of which $36,400 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts yesterday (December 9) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 750 square metres on the roof of an industrial building on Hung To Road, Kwun Tong. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (December 10), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

Coin Collection Programme,2025-12-10 11:00,2025-12-10 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000251.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

âThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (December 10) announced a new service schedule of the two ""Coin Carts"" under the Coin Collection Programme, for the period of January5, 2026 up to March22, 2026. The schedule and other details of the Programme are shown on the HKMA webpage (coincollection.hkma.gov.hk).

Since the launch of the Programme in October 2014 up to November30, 2025, the two Coin Carts had carried out 1 427 000 transactions, collecting 1 088 million coins with a total face value of HK$1,755 million during the period. The collected coins are re-circulated to meet demand.

The Coin Carts provide service at locations that are convenient to the public without affecting the normal flow of traffic and pedestrians. Locations that have suitable power supply facilities, such as the Leisure and Cultural Services Department mobile library service locations, are preferred so as to reduce the need for using the Coin Carts' own stand-by generators. This makes the Programme more environmentally friendly. In selecting the service locations, the HKMA has taken into consideration comments and suggestions given by district councils and members of public; and has consulted the Transport Department and the Hong Kong Police Force as necessary.

The two Coin Carts collect coins from members of public in the 18 districts of Hong Kong on a rotating basis. Under normal circumstances each Coin Cart will stay at a location for a week, subject to availability of the parking space and the maintenance schedule of the Cart. Service hours are from 10am to 7pm. Each vehicle is equipped with two coin counting machines and operational staff will be present to provide assistance. An electrical wheelchair lift is available for use. Users can choose to exchange coins for banknotes or adding value to their stored value facilities, such as Octopus Cards or e-wallets (including AlipayHK, Octopus Wallet, Tap&Go and WeChat Pay). There is also a Community Chest donation box inside each vehicle. The coin collection service is free of charge.

The HKMA will review the Programme from time to time; and will regularly update the service schedule to give advance notice to the public."

Speech by SITI at PolyU Academy of Artificial Intelligence Inauguration (English only) (with photo),2025-12-10 10:40,2025-12-10 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000238.htm,"  Following is a speech by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at the PolyU Academy of Artificial Intelligence (PAAI) Inauguration today (December 10):

Professor Teng (President of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), Professor Teng Jin-guang), Professor Yang (Director of PAAI of PolyU, Professor Yang Qiang), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 On this day of the opening of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Academy for Artificial Intelligence, I am pleased to witness another accomplishment of the PolyU, one of the city's leading tertiary institutions, in promoting global collaboration and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI).

 The country's Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan reaffirm Hong Kong's strategic position as the international innovation and technology centre. Our vision to become a global hub for AI development was underscored in the 2025 Policy Address delivered by our Chief Executive, with promotion of AI being top of our agenda, taken forward through multi-pronged measures on key enablers, including talent, data, industry applications, and more.

 Talents are vital in driving the growth of AI. Supported by landmark programmes such as the AIR@InnoHK research cluster, Hong Kong has gathered over a thousand AI and robotic experts worldwide. New initiatives like the Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme fortify our talent pool by attracting world-class scholars and scientists to Hong Kong and provide a nurturing and thought-provoking environment to foster technological breakthroughs in frontier fields, including AI and quantum information.

 Data is indispensable to AI training and innovation. Secure and trusted flow of data is key. With Hong Kong's unique position under ""One Country, Two Systems"", we are privileged to leverage our distinct advantages in being a meeting point of voluminous amount of data from different places and use cases.

 On this front, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding two years ago in June 2023 with the Cyberspace Administration of China on cross-boundary data flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Specific measures were launched to promote the secure and orderly transfer of personal data within the GBA, facilitating more transparent cross-border flow and use of data.

 Besides, the Government is exploring with relevant Mainland authorities to establish a mechanism to allow cross-boundary flow of research data from the Mainland to the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, thereby supporting, among others, the development of AI and application of big data.

 In parallel, we endeavour to broaden the impact of AI across industries by realising potentials through practical AI applications. Closely following the national strategy of ""AI+"" unveiled last year, the Government's pursuit of the dual objectives of ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"" seeks to embed AI application in both public and private sectors. 

 Taking on the leading role to implement AI in public services, the Digital Policy Office of the Government is introducing AI solutions in areas such as data analytics, customer service and document processing, ensuring that applications are both extensive and secure. Where strong business cases exist, government departments are also encouraged to develop their own tailored AI solutions. 

 On infrastructure, we are also forging ahead to set up the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute (AIRDI) next year. With the mission to link up the academia, industry and government on AI innovation and skill development, the AIRDI will encourage research and breakthroughs in the field of AI, take forward the transformation of research and development outcomes, and enrich application scenarios. I am also happy to share with all of you that a site at Sandy Ridge of Northern Metropolis has also been put to tender in the market for the development of a data facility cluster. We hope this will further strengthen Hong Kong's position as a regional digital infrastructure hub, and advance the development of a digital economy and smart city initiatives.

 With AI influencing every segment of our society, the inauguration of the PolyU Academy for AI marks not just a milestone, but a new chapter in our city's united efforts to expedite the AI development. I am confident that this Academy could inspire ideas, foster collaboration and fuel Hong Kong's AI ecosystem. Thank you."

Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-09 21:49,2025-12-09 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900818.htm,"The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

âFor the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3 billion as of noon today (December 9). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.3 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance to each affected household. As of today, 1 617 cases have been processed. The living allowance is increased from $50,000 to $100,000. In addition, the Support Fund will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 106 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 970 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. SWD staff also paid visits to the affected residents staying in transitional housing units in Kai Tak today and distributed Octopus cards with a face value of $2,000 to facilitate their daily travels and address their imminent needs. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

 As of this morning, a total of 1 431 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 530 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

 The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 700 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 16 000 pieces of donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Handling of reported missing persons
---------------------------------------------

 Officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit completed the search of the area around the buildings and near the collapsed scaffolding, which had been confirmed as safe. Suspected bones were discovered and collected for further testing. In the next phase, search will be conducted after the removal of scaffold nets and scaffolding. In addition, further testing has confirmed that one set of human remains found earlier belongs to two deceased individuals. Therefore, the number of the deceased has increased to 160, with 120 human remains identified. The Police have contacted the families of the missing persons and those who have preliminarily identified the deceased through photographs, and continued to arrange DNA oral swab sampling for them in batches today for scientific identification of the deceased.

Investigations
-----------------

 The Fire Services Department has set up a rope system on the podium of Wang Tai House to access the underground pump room, allowing the DVIU to conduct searches in hard-to-access areas at the fire scene. Additionally, the Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force held another cross-departmental meeting today to continue investigating the causes of the fire.

Regulation and inspection work
-----------------------------------

 The Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau continued to extract concrete core samples from the affected buildings of Wang Fuk Court today. Currently, all seven buildings have been covered.

 Under the ICU's supervision, the miscellaneous items earlier found on some of the scaffolding in the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, namely Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme, have essentially been removed by the contractor. The ICU will continue to inspect regularly and monitor the situation to ensure the safety of residents.

 Regarding the order to remove scaffold nets issued by the Buildings Department (BD), as of today, all 230 private buildings have had their scaffold nets removed from the external walls.

 The BD is striving to announce a new set of arrangements within this week that will require scaffold nets used at construction sites to be sampled on-site and certified as compliant with the relevant standards prior to installation, so that the relevant external wall work can resume as soon as possible.

 The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 371 construction sites, issued a total of 189 written warnings and 101 improvement notices, and taken out 25 prosecutions."

Substantial results were achieved by the meeting, fully demonstrating the positive role of the joint conference mechanism of the legal departments of the three places.

DH announces latest situation on chikungunya fever and advises public not to visit Tsing Yi Nature Trails,2025-12-09 18:50,2025-12-09 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900673.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 9), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 78 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 10 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.Additionally, as the relevant departments will be conducting more intensive mosquito control and prevention work along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails in the near future, the trails will be closed from tonight to the public until further notice. The CHP advises members of the public not to visit the trails for the time being in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF.

  Regarding five local cases of CF who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the CHP yesterday (December 8) held an interdepartmental meeting with representatives from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), the Home Affairs Department, the Drainage Services Department (DSD), the Lands Department, and the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) to discuss ways to enhance anti-mosquito efforts in the area and safeguard public health.

  The five local cases involve two males and three females aged between 49 and 67. The onset dates of their symptoms were between mid-November and December 2. Epidemiological investigations revealed that the activities of the five patients overlapped at the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and that some of them had reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes there. Among them, the latest case visited the trails on November 29.

  Upon receiving notifications of the first case on November 20, the CHP immediately contacted the relevant departments to commence large-scale mosquito prevention and control operations in the vicinity of Tsing Yi. Subsequently, as the sample analysis of some cases have identical genetic sequences, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. As early as November 23, the CHP appealed daily through various channels to individuals who had hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they developed relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). In late November, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission. They were urged to closely monitor whether their patients had compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch provides free testing services.

  Specifically targeting the vicinity of Tsing Yi Nature Trails, various departments have adopted a series of measures:


The FEHD has co-ordinated mosquito prevention and control efforts among relevant departments and stakeholders in their respective purviews through the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts. Tools such as large ultra-low volume foggers and robot dogs have been deployed to conduct more than 40 fogging operations to kill adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails, covering the entire trails and the perimeter. The FEHD has also eliminated about 600 potential mosquito breeding sites and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in 80 areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediatelyand installed new mosquito traps. In addition, pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging the public to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also visited nearby schools and childcare facilities to provide information and assistance on mosquito prevention and control. Furthermore, the FEHD has stepped up inspections of construction sites and residential premises near the trails, instituted two prosecutions against those responsible for violations related to mosquito breeding, and issued eight statutory notices for the elimination of stagnant water.




The Kwai Tsing District Office (K&TDO), which is responsible for the maintenance of the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, has instructed its contractor to enhance mosquito prevention and control measures, including grass cutting, clearing blockages in drainage, conducting fogging operations, and application of larvicide oil or larvicides. In addition, K&TDO has displayed posters at the entrances, pavilions and sitting-out areas along the trails to remind visitors and hikers to use insect repellents and take protective measures. K&TDO also continuously disseminates information on mosquito prevention to residents in the district through the local networks of the District Council Members, Area Committees, and Care Teams.




Since the end of November, the DSD has carried out a number of drainage cleaning operations in the vicinity of the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, removing silt and debris from drainage facilities to ensure the system is functioning and prevent stagnant water and mosquito breeding.




The District Lands Office of Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing has removed illegal cultivations, metal canopies,and bamboo sticks on relevant government land. The CEDD has requested contractors and site supervisory staff to arrangesite inspections, including its surrounding areas, to ensure that the mosquito prevention measures taken are as effective as possible. Regarding mosquito prevention and control measures, these include conducting regular inspections, removing stagnant water, applying larvicidal oil, and setting up mosquito traps on-site with regular checksand replacement of baits.


  Although relevant departments have conducted a series of mosquito prevention and control operations in the past two to three weeks, there are still members of the public who have been infected after visiting the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, indicating that the risk of infection in the relevant area remains. The Tsing Yi Nature Trails are situated in a countryside environment and cover a vast area, with the hiking trails stretching approximately 7 000 metres. Compared with urban settings, mosquito control work there faces greater challenges. Along both sides of the trails, there are various natural breeding grounds for vectors, including puddles on soil surfaces and fallen leaves, which increase the risk of mosquito breeding.

  After discussion yesterday, various departments have further confirmed measures to strengthen mosquito prevention and control in the vicinity of the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Considering that more intensive anti-mosquito operations will be conducted there, the Tsing Yi Nature Trails will be temporarily closed to the public until further notice. During the period, the FEHD, together with other departments, will further strengthen the intensity and frequency of mosquito prevention and control measures along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, including continued fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  The CHP will send letters to doctors again and urge them to pay attention to patients' conditions. In case patients present with relevant symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash, doctors shall arrange relevant testing as soon as possible.

  Meanwhile, regarding the recently announced local case involving a23-year-old female living in Sheung Wan, the epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The CHP continues to urge members of the public residing and working at Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. CHP officers continue to reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind individuals to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 2 700 individuals residing or working in the district through the health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre, its enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past four days. Two individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests. All tested negative for the chikungunya virus.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

衞生署公布基孔肯雅熱最新情況　忠告市民不要前往青衣自然徑,2025-12-09 17:18,2025-12-09 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900603.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月九日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。本港今年累計錄得78宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，10宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。另外，考慮到相關部門近期將在青衣自然徑進行更密集的滅蚊防蚊工作，青衣自然徑將於今日晚上起暫停向公眾開放，直至另行通告為止。中心忠告市民現階段不要前往青衣自然徑，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險。

因應近期有五宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，中心昨日（十二月八日）與食物環境衞生署（食環署）、民政事務總署、渠務署、地政總署和土木工程拓展署代表舉行跨部門會議，討論進一步加強有關地點的防治蚊患工作，以保障公眾衞生和健康。

該五宗本地個案涉及兩男三女，年齡介乎49至67歲。他們於十一月中旬至十二月二日期間發病。流行病學調查顯示，五名患者的活動地點在青衣自然徑重疊，部分報稱在該徑被蚊叮咬，其中最新一宗個案於十一月二十九日到訪該徑。

中心於十一月二十日接獲首宗個案呈報後，已即時聯絡相關部門，在青衣一帶展開大規模防蚊滅蚊行動。及後，鑑於一些個案的樣本分析結果顯示相同基因序列，中心經評估後認為該自然徑風險較高，早於十一月二十三日起透過不同途徑每日呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。中心在上月底亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

特別針對青衣自然徑一帶的情況，各部門已採取一系列措施：


食環署已透過跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內的防蚊滅蚊工作。食環署已利用大型超低微量噴霧器及機械狗等工具在該處一帶進行超過40次霧化處理殺滅成蚊行動，範圍涵蓋整條自然徑及自然徑外圍。食環署亦已清理約600個潛在蚊子滋生地，在80個無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑，並設置新型捕蚊器。此外，食環署向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。同時，食環署亦到訪附近範圍內的學校和幼兒設施，提供防蚊滅蚊資訊及協助。在巡查方面，食環署已加緊巡查自然徑附近一帶的地盤工地及住宅處所，向違規的負責人提出兩宗有關蚊蟲滋生的檢控及發出八張法定消除積水通知書。
負責青衣自然徑保養維修的葵青民政事務處（葵青民政處）已指示承辦商加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括剪草、清理去水渠、進行霧化處理，以及施放蚊油／殺幼蟲劑等。另外，民政處已在青衣自然徑的出入口、涼亭及休憩處等張貼海報，提醒訪客及行山人士使用昆蟲驅避劑及採取防護措施。葵青民政處亦透過區議員、分區委員會和關愛隊的地區網絡向區內居民持續宣傳防蚊資訊。
渠務署自十一月底起於青衣自然徑一帶完成了多次渠道清理工作，將排水設施中的沙泥及雜物清除，確保渠道暢通以防止積水及蚊蟲滋生。
荃灣葵青地政處已清除了在相關政府土地上的非法耕種植物、金屬篷和竹枝。而土木工程拓展署亦要求承建商及駐工地督導人員，巡視工地及其鄰近範圍，確保在工地採取的防蚊措施達到最佳成效。預防及滅蚊措施，包括定期巡查、清理積水及噴灑蚊油，及在工地內設置蚊子陷阱並定期檢查及更換藥餌等。


儘管相關部門在過去兩至三周已進行一連串防蚊滅蚊行動，但仍發現有曾到訪青衣自然徑的市民受感染，顯示有關地帶的感染風險依然存在。青衣自然徑屬郊野環境且覆蓋範圍甚廣，行山徑長約7 000米，與市區環境相比，控蚊工作面臨更大挑戰。該自然徑兩旁的地方均存在着各種天然病媒滋生地，包括泥土表面的水窪、落葉等，增加蚊蟲滋生風險。

各部門昨日經討論後，已敲定進一步在青衣自然徑一帶加強防控蚊患的措施。考慮到近期將在該處進行更密集的滅蚊防蚊工作，青衣自然徑將會暫停向公眾開放，直至另行通告為止。在這段期間，食環署會聯同其他部門進一步在青衣自然徑一帶加強防控蚊患措施的力度及頻次，包括持續進行霧化處理殺滅成蚊行動。

中心將再次致函全港醫生，呼籲他們密切留意患者情況。一旦病人出現相關症狀，如發熱、關節痛或皮疹等，醫生應盡快安排相關化驗。

另外，就上周公布的一宗本地個案（涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子），流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。中心繼續呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾2 700名在當區工作或居住的市民進行評估，而過去四日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為兩名早前出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，全部樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

二零二四年香港對外直接投資統計數字,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900327.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月九日）發表二零二四年香港對外直接投資統計數字。

直接投資存量

於二零二四年年底，香港外來直接投資總存量（即香港直接投資負債頭寸）較上年年底上升9.1%至200,496億元，相當於二零二四年本地生產總值的631%。二零二四年的升幅主要是由於該年內流入香港的直接投資錄得正數。

就香港向外直接投資總存量（即香港直接投資資產頭寸）而言，則較二零二三年年底上升6.7%至188,900億元，相當於二零二四年本地生產總值的595%。二零二四年的升幅主要是由於該年內流出往境外企業的直接投資錄得正數，而匯率波動導致的下跌則抵銷了部分的升幅，原因在於部分直接投資資產以其他貨幣計價。

按投資的直接來源地分析，中國內地（內地）及英屬維爾京群島是最大的兩個香港外來直接投資來源地，在二零二四年年底分別佔32.7%及30.4%。按有接受外來直接投資的香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析，從事投資及控股、地產、專業及商用服務的香港企業集團佔最大比重，在二零二四年年底達68.2%。其次為銀行，佔11.0%；以及進出口貿易、批發及零售，佔10.5%。

按投資的首個目的地分析，內地及英屬維爾京群島也是香港向外直接投資最大的兩個目的地，在二零二四年年底分別佔52.1%及27.6%。按有作出向外直接投資的香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析，從事投資及控股、地產、專業及商用服務的香港企業集團佔最大比重，在二零二四年年底達78.8%。其次為進出口貿易、批發及零售，佔8.6%。

直接投資流量

在二零二四年，直接投資總流入為9,824億元，多於二零二三年的9,549億元。另一方面，二零二四年的直接投資總流出為6,292億元，較二零二三年的7,529億元為少。把流入和流出一併計算，在二零二四年錄得3,532億元的直接投資淨流入。

按投資的直接來源地分析，內地是二零二四年香港直接投資流入的主要來源，達4,660億元。其次為英屬維爾京群島，有2,370 億元。按有接受直接投資流入的香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析，從事投資及控股、地產、專業及商用服務的香港企業集團，在二零二四年吸納了最多的直接投資流入，達5,880億元。

按投資的首個目的地分析，內地佔二零二四年香港直接投資流出的最大比重，達3,729億元。其次為英屬維爾京群島，有1,989 億元。按有作出直接投資流出的香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析，從事投資及控股、地產、專業及商用服務的香港企業集團流出的直接投資最多，達4,529億元。

評論

政府發言人表示，香港仍然是全球其中一個主要對外直接投資目的地及來源地，二零二四年繼續錄得龐大的直接投資總流入和總流出，分別達9,824億元和6,292億元。外來直接投資和向外直接投資總存量亦進一步增加，截至二零二四年年底分別達200,496億元及188,900億元（相當於本地生產總值的631%及595%）。這印證香港作為主要國際金融和商業中心的地位，以及跨國企業的首選據點，並反映全球投資者對香港經濟前景充滿信心。

香港的對外直接投資涵蓋廣闊地域及多種經濟活動，其中內地是香港對外直接投資的重要來源地及目的地。這突顯香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色。

政府將繼續利用香港的獨特優勢發揮「內聯外通」的角色，持續全方位深化香港的國際聯繫，並積極採取措施吸引更多內地企業以香港作為平台出海。政府亦會加強政策，吸引更多策略性企業落戶香港，促進高質量發展。

其他資料

直接投資是指某經濟體的投資者對另一經濟體內的企業所作的對外投資，並對該企業擁有持久利益及在其管理上具有相當程度的影響力或話語權。就統計計算而言，若投資者持有某企業10%或以上的表決權，便視作對該企業的管理具話語權。

根據國際統計標準，上述的直接投資總存量及流量數字是按「資產／負債原則」編製，而按國家／地區及按香港企業集團的主要經濟活動分析的直接投資詳細數字則按「方向原則」編製。由於採用了不同的展示原則，直接投資總存量及流量與按國家／地區或按香港企業集團的主要經濟活動劃分的直接投資詳細數字的總和有所不同。然而，根據這兩種展示原則各自編製的數字所得出的整體直接投資差額是相同的。

二零二三年及二零二四年按選定主要投資者國家／地區及按香港企業集團的主要經濟活動劃分的香港外來直接投資頭寸（即存量）及流量的數字，分別載列於表一及表二。而香港向外直接投資的相應統計數字則載列於表三及表四。

二零二五年第三季服務行業按季業務收益指數,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900346.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月九日）發表的業務收益指數的臨時數字顯示，二零二五年第三季與二零二四年第三季比較，不少主要服務行業以價值計算的業務收益均有不同程度的升幅。

二零二五年第三季與二零二四年第三季比較，保險業（+40.7%）、金融業（銀行除外）（+31.4%）、進出口貿易業（+24.5%）及銀行業（+12.9%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，運輸業的業務收益指數同期則下跌5.8%。

按服務界別分析，電腦及資訊科技服務界別的業務收益指數同期按年上升99.1%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別的業務收益指數亦按年上升4.6%。

二零二五年第三季與二零二五年第二季比較，不少主要服務行業經季節性調整的業務收益（以價值計算）均錄得不同程度的升幅。當中，保險業（+23.9%）的業務收益指數錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，貨倉及倉庫業的業務收益指數同期則下跌5.6%。

按服務界別分析，二零二五年第三季與二零二五年第二季比較，電腦及資訊科技服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數上升20.0%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數亦上升6.8%。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第三季不少服務行業的業務收益較去年同期上升，其中保險業、金融業（銀行除外）、進出口貿易業及銀行業的升幅較為顯著。

展望未來，整體服務行業的業務應會繼續擴張。環球經濟維持溫和增長，加上中美貿易緊張局勢緩和，應會為貿易相關的行業提供支持。本地消費氣氛繼續改善、訪港旅客人次持續增長、金融市場活動暢旺，以及政府多項發展經濟及開拓多元化市場的措施，將繼續惠及各個服務行業。然而，外部不確定性對個別行業的影響仍需密切關注。

進一步資料

表1載列最近五季選定服務行業及服務界別的業務收益指數及其相應按年變動百分率，而表2則載列最近五季經季節性調整的業務收益指數按季變動百分率。

二零二五年第三季的業務收益指數的修訂數字將於二零二六年一月十九日在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/web_table.html?id=660-69001）發布。

編製業務收益指數所用的數據主要來自政府統計處進行的「服務行業按季統計調查」，並輔以香港金融管理局及香港旅遊發展局提供的有關數據。

服務界別有別於服務行業，前者包括橫跨不同行業但與某個共同主題相關的經濟活動。服務界別可能包括某個服務行業內所有公司進行的全部經濟活動，而該服務行業與該服務界別關係密切。然而，在一個與該服務界別關係不太密切的服務行業內，只有部分公司甚或只有這些公司的部分經濟活動是與該服務界別有關。以旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別為例，這界別包括所有會議展覽機構的服務、短期住宿服務及旅行社所提供的服務，以及食肆、零售商及運輸服務營辦商的部分服務（只包括以旅客為對象的服務）。

服務行業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各類經濟統計調查，把經濟單位分類歸入合適的行業類別。

二零二五年十一月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900306.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月九日）發表二零二五年十一月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年十月在收縮區域的44.8下跌至二零二五年十一月的44.5，而未來一個月（即二零二五年十二月）的業務收益展望動向指數為47.5。按行業分析，一些統計調查涵蓋的行業的業務收益現時動向指數在二零二五年十一月較上月下跌，特別是物流業（從43.3下跌至42.2）及進出口貿易業（從45.7下跌至44.7）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年十月的47.1下跌至二零二五年十一月的46.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年十二月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.4。

評論

政府發言人表示，繼在過去數月錄得明顯改善後，十一月中小企的營商氣氛大致平穩。雖然業務收益的現時動向指數從上月高位輕微下跌，但展望未來一個月情況的指數保持在高位。與此同時，整體就業情況較上月輕微改善。

展望未來，香港經濟進一步穩健增長會支持本地營商氣氛。惟外圍環境的不確定因素仍在，政府會密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指從業人數少於50人的公司。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於規模較大的公司的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己公司情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for November 2025,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900342.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (December 9) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for November 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs decreased from 44.8 in October 2025 in the contractionary zone to 44.5 in November 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. December 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 47.5. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts for some surveyed sectors dropped in November 2025 as compared with previous month, particularly for the logistics (from 43.3 to 42.2) and import and export trades (from 45.7 to 44.7).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades decreased from 47.1 in October 2025 to 46.0 in November 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. December 2025) was 47.4.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs was broadly stable in November after having shown some visible improvement over the past several months. While the current diffusion index on business receipts eased slightly from the high in the preceding month, the index on outlook in one month's time stayed at an elevated level. Meanwhile, the overall employment situation improved slightly from the preceding month.

  Looking ahead, further solid growth of the Hong Kong economy will support local business sentiment. Nevertheless, as the uncertainties in the external environment persist, the Government will monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to companies with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent companies in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

Quarterly business receipts indices for service industries for third quarter of 2025,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900525.htm,"  Business receipts in value terms of many major service industries showed increases of varying magnitudes in the third quarter of 2025 when compared with the third quarter of 2024, according to the provisional figures of business receipts indices released today (December 9) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  Comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the third quarter of 2024, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the insurance (+40.7%), financing (except banking) (+31.4%), import/export trade (+24.5%) and banking (+12.9%) industries. On the other hand, the transportation industry recorded a decrease of 5.8% in business receipts index during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 99.1% year-on-year during the same period, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 4.6% year-on-year.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, business receipts in value terms of many major service industries recorded increases of varying magnitudes in the third quarter of 2025 when compared with the second quarter of 2025. In particular, a double-digit increase was recorded in business receipts index of the insurance (+23.9%) industry. On the other hand, business receipts index of the warehousing and storage industry decreased by 5.6% during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the second quarter of 2025 on a seasonally adjusted basis, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 20.0%, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 6.8%.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business receipts of many service industries increased in the third quarter of 2025 over a year earlier, with more notable increases seen for the insurance, financing (except banking), import/export trade and banking industries.

  Looking ahead, business of the service industries as a whole should continue to expand. Sustained moderate growth of the global economy, coupled with easing China-US trade tensions, should provide support to trade-related sectors. Continued improvement in local consumer sentiment, sustained growth in visitor arrivals, vibrant financial market activities, and the Government's various measures to develop the economy and diversify markets will continue to bode well for various service industries. Notwithstanding, the impact of external uncertainties on certain industries still warrants close attention.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the business receipts indices and their corresponding year-on-year rates of change in respect of selected service industries and service domains for the recent five quarters, while Table 2 shows the corresponding quarter-to-quarter rates of change in the business receipts indices for the recent five quarters based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures of business receipts indices for the third quarter of 2025 will be released at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=660-69001) on January 19, 2026.

  Data for compiling the business receipts indices are mainly based on the Quarterly Survey of Service Industries conducted by the C&SD, supplemented by relevant data provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

  A service domain differs from a service industry in that it comprises those economic activities which straddle different industries but are somehow related to a common theme. It may include all activities carried out by all companies in a service industry that is closely related to the domain. For a service industry that is less closely related, however, only a portion of the companies in the industry or even only part of the economic activities of the companies is related to the domain. Taking the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain as an example, it includes all services of convention and exhibition organisers, short-term accommodation services and services of travel agents, and some of the services (only those involving visitors as customers) of restaurants, retailers and transport operators.

  The classification of service industries follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into relevant industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Quarterly Business Receipts Indices for Service Industries, Third Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520).

External Direct Investment of Hong Kong in 2024,2025-12-09 16:30,2025-12-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900320.htm,"  Hong Kong's external direct investment (DI) statistics for 2024 were released today (December 9) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

Stocks of DI

  At the end of 2024, the total stock of Hong Kong's inward DI (i.e. the position of Hong Kong's DI liabilities) increased by 9.1% over a year earlier to $20,049.6 billion. Its ratio to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stood at 631% in 2024. The increase in 2024 was mainly attributable to the positive DI inflow to Hong Kong.

  As for the total stock of Hong Kong's outward DI (i.e. the position of Hong Kong's DI assets), it increased by 6.7% over 2023 to $18,890.0 billion. Its ratio to GDP was 595% in 2024. The increase in 2024 was mainly attributable to the positive DI outflow to enterprises outside Hong Kong, partly offset by the decrease resulting from exchange rate variations, as some DI assets are denominated in other currencies.

  Analysed by immediate source of investment, Chinese Mainland (the Mainland) and the British Virgin Islands (BVI) were the two largest sources for Hong Kong's inward DI, with a share of 32.7% and 30.4% respectively at end-2024. Analysed by major economic activity of Hong Kong enterprise groups (HKEGs) which had received inward DI, those engaged in investment and holding, real estate, professional and business services took up the largest share, at 68.2% at end-2024. This was followed by banking, at 11.0%; and import/export, wholesale and retail trades, at 10.5%.

  Analysed by immediate destination of investment, the Mainland and the BVI were also the two largest destinations for Hong Kong's outward DI, with a share of 52.1% and 27.6% respectively at end-2024. Analysed by major economic activity of HKEGs which had made outward DI, those engaged in investment and holding, real estate, professional and business services took up the largest share, at 78.8% at end 2024. This was followed by import/export, wholesale and retail trades, at 8.6%.

Flows of DI

  In 2024, total DI inflow amounted to $982.4 billion, larger than that of $954.9 billion in 2023. On the other hand, total DI outflow in 2024 amounted to $629.2 billion, smaller than that of $752.9 billion in 2023. Taking the inflow and outflow together, a net DI inflow of $353.2 billion was recorded in 2024.

  Analysed by immediate source of investment, the Mainland was the major source of Hong Kong's DI inflow in 2024, amounting to $466.0 billion. The BVI came next, at $237.0 billion. Analysed by major economic activity of HKEGs which had received DI inflow, those engaged in investment and holding, real estate, professional and business services attracted the largest amount in 2024, at $588.0 billion.

  Analysed by immediate destination of investment, the Mainland accounted for a predominant share of Hong Kong's DI outflow in 2024, at $372.9 billion. The BVI came next, at $198.9 billion. Analysed by major economic activity of HKEGs which had made DI outflow, those engaged in investment and holding, real estate, professional and business services took up the largest amount, at $452.9 billion.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that Hong Kong remains one of the world's major destinations for and sources of external DI. Total DI inflow and outflow continued to be significant in 2024, at $982.4 billion and $629.2 billion respectively. The stocks of overall inward and outward DI also increased further to $20,049.6 billion and $18,890.0 billion (631% and 595% of GDP) respectively at end-2024. These testify Hong Kong’s status as a prominent international centre for finance and commerce and a preferred base for multinational corporations, while also reflect strong global investor confidence in Hong Kong's economic prospects.

  Hong Kong's DI covers a large geographical spread and a wide range of economic activities, with the Mainland featuring prominently both as a source and as a destination. This underscores Hong Kong's pivotal roles as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"".

  The Government will continue to leverage on Hong Kong's unique advantages in fulfilling its role in connecting the Mainland with the world. Persistent efforts have been made in deepening Hong Kong's international connectivity on all fronts, and proactive measures have been taken in attracting more Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong as a platform to go global. The Government will also strengthen its policies for bringing in more strategic enterprises to set up in Hong Kong, thereby promoting high-quality development.

Further Information

  DI represents external investment in which an investor of an economy acquires a lasting interest and a significant degree of influence or an effective voice in the management of an enterprise located in another economy. For statistical purpose, an effective voice is taken as being equivalent to a holding of 10% or more of the voting power in an enterprise.

  According to the international statistical standards, the total stocks and flows of DI presented above are compiled based on the ""asset/liability principle"", while detailed DI figures analysed by country/territory and by major economic activity of HKEGs are based on the ""directional principle"". Owing to the adoption of different presentation principles, the total stocks and flows of DI are different from the sums of the detailed DI figures by country/territory or by major economic activity of HKEGs. However, the overall direct investment balance compiled from figures based on these two presentation principles respectively is the same.

  Tables 1 and 2 show the positions (i.e. stocks) and flows of inward DI in Hong Kong by selected major investor country/territory and by major economic activity of HKEGs respectively for 2023 and 2024. Similar statistics on outward DI from Hong Kong are presented in Tables 3 and 4.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""External Direct Investment Statistics of Hong Kong 2024"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040003&scode=260).

Winfried (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges), Moray (Executive Director of Security, Integrity and Information Security of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Moray Taylor-Smith), David (President of the Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute, Mr David Simmonds), Irene (Assistant Director of Corruption Prevention of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), Ms Irene Wang), Edgar (Honorary Secretary General of the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC), Mr Edgar Yang), friends from the sports sector, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon and good to see you all here today.

It has been a difficult two weeks for Hong Kong, as we collectively and gradually come out of the haze of the Tai Po fire. In times like these, it is vital for our entire community to join the Government in providing every possible support to those affected. So I must start by acknowledging the Hong Kong Jockey Club for its generous donation through the Jockey Club Emergency Relief Fund and for pledging the gross income of its November 30 race meeting to the Hong Kong Government's support fund. I also hope that the sports sector can contribute positive energy to help Hong Kong through this period.

As our Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, has stated, the Government is committed to investigating the causes of this incident and addressing the issues that it has raised across multiple fronts. Systemic reform is essential - not only in response to this tragedy, but as a principle that we must uphold in all areas of public service.

Supporting systemic reform in any organisation begins with what we term a ""good design of top-level governance structure"", for those who know Cantonese, éå±¤è¨­è¨çé«å¶å»ºè¨­. Within such a structure, principles like ""governance"" and ""integrity"" are not just important - they are indispensable. They are key to delivering results, ensuring accountability, and achieving long-term success. It is precisely for these reasons that governance within the sports sector has been a priority of mine since I assumed the role of the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism a year ago - in fact, it is this very topic that I addressed in one of my first speeches in this position.

In my remarks today, I will first outline why governance is so important from a policy perspective, then share what we have been doing to strengthen it, and finally touch on the path ahead.

First, good governance ensures integrity and accountability. A sound governance framework guides how organisations make critical decisions and establishes appropriate checks and balances. It helps build a healthy ecosystem for the sports sector, enabling national sports associations, NSAs in short, to modernise their management and operations, and to grow sustainably. As the Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute aptly states in its purpose: ""Better governance leading to better decisions for a better world"". This succinctly captures the objective of upholding strong governance.

Second, good governance fosters professionalism and impartiality. Put simply, it ensures NSAs always act in the best interests of their organisations and athletes. Senior executives must place the organisation's mission above any personal interests. This is especially important in areas such as athlete selection for representing the Hong Kong, China team - a process that, when conducted fairly, helps elevate overall athletic performance.

Third, good governance ensures public funds are used effectively and responsibly. To provide context, in the 2025-26 financial year, the budget for sports development exceeds HK$9 billion - more than double the amount from a decade ago. Of this, over HK$1 billion is dedicated to elite sports development. We have a duty to ensure that public money is spent wisely and productively. As we consider how to increase investment in sports development, a robust governance framework is an essential prerequisite. We could not possibly allocate precious additional resources to NSAs unless we are confident that there is satisfactory governance. To put it bluntly, pouring good money after bad is never an option.

Fourth, we should aspire to be a global standard-setter in sports governance. This is no small ambition. But as a modern society that takes pride in its rule of law and professional services - including the governance experts here today - I believe we should aim high.

Now let me turn to what the Government has done to promote governance in the sports sectors.

In recent years, the sports sector in Hong Kong has embarked on an important journey to enhance transparency, accountability, integrity and operational efficiency. In November 2024, under the steer of the Government, the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China completed a comprehensive review of NSA operations and corporate governance standards. I would like to thank the ""three wise men"" - Dr York Chow, Mr KS Tang (Mr Tang King-shing) and Mr CN Ma (Mr Ma Ching-nam), who I believe are with us today - for their invaluable guidance throughout this process.

The SF&OC has since promulgated a code of practice covering board governance, integrity management, athlete selection, coach and umpire management, membership administration, and general administration.

Over the past year, the SF&OC has worked diligently with NSAs and key stakeholders, including the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute and the ICAC, to implement this code in full.

Some NSAs are further along in achieving full compliance than others, and I expect these NSAs to set an example for others to follow. The SF&OC has also enlisted pro bono legal support from the Law Society of Hong Kong to assist NSAs with code-related legal matters. I am also very pleased to note that the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the HKCGI will soon launch a Sports Governance Programme to equip NSA officers and executives with essential governance skills.

Ladies and gentlemen, what we are witnessing is a true team effort - one that demonstrates our shared determination to modernise Hong Kong's sports sector through updated governance practices. This will not only benefit our athletes and support the professional, sustainable development of sports, but also strengthen Hong Kong's influence in the global sports arena.

Before I conclude, I would like to thank the Hong Kong Jockey Club and the HKCGI for echoing the Government's call to enhance the corporate governance in sports. I am most encouraged by today's symposium, such a big turnout, and its excellent lineup of local and international speakers.

The SF&OC and our NSAs are entrusted with significant and exciting responsibilities in advancing sports development in Hong Kong. Their professionalism, competence and capability have never been more important. This symposium is only the beginning of a series of programmes, and I look forward to your continued support.

I wish you all a fruitful day filled with inspiration and meaningful exchange.

Thank you."

日本進口水產的檢測情況,2025-12-09 15:36,2025-12-09 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900550.htm,"因應日本政府單方面決定把福島核電站核污水排放大海，食物環境衞生署署長已發出《食物安全命令》，禁止源自日本10（都）縣的水產、海鹽和海藻食品進口本港，受禁（都）縣包括東京、福島、茨城、宮城、千葉、群馬、栃木、新潟、長野和埼玉。

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由十二月八日中午截至今日（十二月九日）中午，食安中心已對162個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對50個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共186 708個日本進口食物樣本（包括121 140個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共41 614個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-12-09 15:36,2025-12-09 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900551.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 8 to noon today (December 9), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 162 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 186 708 samples of food imported from Japan (including 121 140 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 41 614 samples of local catch respectively.

政府就實施加密資產申報框架和與共同匯報標準有關修訂展開公眾諮詢,2025-12-09 15:00,2025-12-09 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900284.htm,"政府今日（十二月九日）就在香港實施經濟合作及發展組織（經合組織）頒布的加密資產申報框架和與共同匯報標準有關的修訂展開公眾諮詢。

香港一直支持國際間提升稅務透明度及打擊跨境逃稅的工作。自二○一八年起，香港按經合組織制定的共同匯報標準，每年與夥伴稅務管轄區自動交換財務帳戶資料，讓相關稅務當局可運用該等資料作稅務評估，以及偵查和打擊逃稅。

隨着數碼資產市場近年急促發展，經合組織於二○二三年公布申報框架，讓夥伴稅務管轄區每年自動交換與加密資產交易相關的稅務資料，以及將新數碼金融產品及優化的申報及盡職審查規定納入共同匯報標準。

財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇表示：「為展現香港致力推動國際稅務合作及打擊跨境逃稅的決心，履行國際義務，我們會修訂《稅務條例》（第112章）（《條例》）以實施申報框架及新修訂的共同匯報標準。這舉措亦對維持香港作為國際金融和商業中心的聲譽至為重要。」

「政府計劃明年內完成所需的本地立法修訂，目標是從二○二八年起與相關夥伴稅務管轄區自動交換與加密資產交易相關的稅務資料，以及由二○二九年起實施新修訂的共同匯報標準。香港會在互惠原則下與合適夥伴自動交換稅務資料，當中，夥伴須符合與保障資料保密和安全相關的標準。」

此外，經合組織自二○二四年起就香港落實共同匯報標準的行政框架的成效展開第二輪成員相互評估。考慮過經合組織的意見後，政府建議透過修訂《條例》，強制申報財務機構登記以加強識辨，並提高罰則及優化執法機制，以期在經合組織成員相互評估中維持良好評級，鞏固香港作為國際金融和商業中心的聲譽。

諮詢文件已上載財經事務及庫務局網頁（www.fstb.gov.hk/tb/tc/others/consultation.htm）。文件介紹經合組織頒布的申報框架及新修訂的共同匯報標準，並闡述上述立法建議的詳情及相關實施事宜（包括申報流程、備存紀錄要求、罰則及執法工作等）。歡迎公眾於二○二六年二月六日或以前，以郵寄（香港添馬添美道2號政府總部24樓）或電郵（carf@fstb.gov.hk）方式，就各項建議提交意見。"

Public consultation on implementation of Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework and amendments in relation to Common Reporting Standard launched,2025-12-09 15:00,2025-12-09 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/09/P2025120900283.htm,"The Government today (December 9) launched a public consultation on the implementation of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and amendments in relation to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) promulgated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong has long been supportive of international efforts to enhance tax transparency and combat cross-border tax evasion. Since 2018, Hong Kong has been exchanging financial account information automatically with partner jurisdictions on an annual basis in accordance with the CRS developed by the OECD, which enables the relevant tax authorities to utilise such information for tax assessments, as well as for detecting and combating tax evasion.

In light of the rapid development of digital asset markets in recent years, in 2023, the OECD published CARF to provide for the automatic exchange of tax information on crypto-asset transactions with partner jurisdictions on an annual basis, and incorporated into the CRS new digital financial products and enhanced requirements regrading reporting and due diligence.

The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said,""To demonstrate our commitment to promoting international tax co-operation and combating cross-border tax evasion, as well as to fulfil our international obligations, Hong Kong will make amendments to the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (the Ordinance) for implementing CARF and the newly amended CRS. This is also of paramount importance in maintaining Hong Kong's reputation as an international financial and commercial centre.

""The Government plans to complete the necessary local legislative amendments in the coming year, with a view to commencing the automatic exchange of tax information on crypto-asset transactions with relevant partner jurisdictions starting from 2028, and implementing the newly amended CRS starting from 2029. Hong Kong will implement the automatic exchange of tax information with suitable partners, which are required to meet the standards relating to the protection of data confidentiality and security, on a reciprocal basis.""

In addition, since 2024, the OECD has been conducting the second round of a peer review on the effectiveness of Hong Kong's administrative framework for implementing the CRS. Having taken into consideration the OECD's views, the Government proposes, through amendments to the Ordinance, to introduce mandatory registration for financial institutions to enhance identification, as well as to raise the penalty levels and enhance the enforcement mechanism, in order to maintain a favourable rating in the OECD's peer reviews and maintain Hong Kong's reputation as an international financial and commercial centre.

The consultation paper is available on the website of the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (www.fstb.gov.hk/tb/en/others/consultation.htm). It outlines CARF and the newly amended CRS promulgated by the OECD, and sets out in detail the abovementioned legislative proposals and relevant implementation matters (including reporting procedures, record-keeping requirements, penalty levels and enforcement, etc). Members of the public are welcome to forward their views on the proposals by post (24/F, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong) or email (carf@fstb.gov.hk) by February 6, 2026."

  The carpark provides 146 parking spaces, comprising 116 for private cars as well as 10 each for motorcycles, light goods vehicles and light buses. All of them, except for those for light buses, are equipped with fee-paying electric vehicle charging facilities. Smart equipment including the access control system, licence plate recognition system with automatic barrier arm and parking bay information system have been adopted in the carpark to enhance motorists' travel and parking experience. The carpark also supports multiple payment means. Motorists may access the real-time information about the vacancy of the carpark through the TD's mobile application HKeMobility.

  The carpark is leased to an operator for its management and operation via the Government Property Agency, while parking spaces within the hospital area are managed by CMHHK.

  A spokesman for the TD said that the Government will continue to pursue a host of measures to increase the supply of parking spaces, including incorporation of carparks in suitable government, institution or community facilities and public open space projects in accordance with the ""single site, multiple use"" principle, thereby increasing the supply of parking spaces to address the public's demand and achieving optimal land use."

Mr Hocquard (Director General of the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), Mr Simon Hocquard), Mr Han (Director-General of theCivil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Chair of the Asia Pacific CANSO, Mr Han Kok-juan), Mr Arel (Chair of CANSO, Mr Tim Arel), Messrs Ma (Deputy Administrator of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), Mr Ma Bing, and Regional Director of Asia Pacific Office, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Mr Ma Tao), Mr Miao (Director-General of the Air Traffic Management Bureau of the CAAC, Mr Miao Xuan), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning, and to our friends from abroad, a very warm welcome to Hong Kong. It is my great honour to address the CANSO Airspace Asia Pacific 2025. With our prime location right at the heart of Asia, half of the world's population are within five hours by air. Not to mention as a premier southern gateway to the world's second largest economy - the Chinese Mainland - Hong Kong is truly the perfect place to host this remarkable event.

Backed by firm national support and strong global connectivity, Hong Kong is widely recognised as an international aviation hub. Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is a world leader in air cargo and a top international passenger airport. Last year, it handled 53 million passengers, an increase of one-third year-on-year, ranked among the top 10 busiest international passenger airports in the world. Over the first 10 months this year, HKIA already handled over 50 million passengers, representing 15 per cent growth compared to the same period last year. Cargo volume rose by 2.3 per cent year-on-year to over 4.1 million tonnes. Currently, about 140 airlines are operating, connecting us to over 200 destinations around the world. I'm very happy to say today that HKIA is just named by the 2025 World Travel Awards as the world's leading airport in terms of customer experience.

As we have turned our dual-runway into a three-runway system, we are accelerating the expansion of the aviation network. Over the past two years, we have expanded bilateral air services agreements with more than 10 countries. I am happy to tell you that just the past two months, we have managed to strike deals and detailed agreements with a handful of South American countries, namely Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Cuba, as well as Poland in Europe and Togo in West Africa. These are all countries in our major aviation partner network, including under the Belt and Road Initiative. In a way, we hope that we will extend our air connectivity to support our business and tourism sectors when dealing with all these countries.

While managing the very busy high-altitude air traffic, we are also actively exploring the opportunities presented by emerging unmanned air mobility technologies flying at the low altitude. As one of the themes of this conference, ""Seamless Airspace: Integrating Manned, Uncrewed, and Advanced Air Mobility"" is a powerful reflection of both the dynamic skies around the world. Today, allow me to take you through our journey of turning this vision of seamless integration from concept into tangible reality.

In Hong Kong, a city known for its ambition and innovation, we are building a new layer of intelligent, connected infrastructure in the airspace below 1 000 metres. We recognise that the low-altitude economy (LAE) is a very powerful convergence of aviation, digitalisation and green technology. But its success hinges on one critical factor: the safe, efficient and scalable integration of new air mobility technologies and solutions into our existing airspace system.

Our strategy to achieve this is built on a disciplined, three-phase approach, and together we mapped out a roadmap that helps us to move from very controlled testing scenarios to real-life, full-scale applications.

First, we began with conceptualisation and proof of concept. In March this year, we launched our LAE ""Regulatory Sandbox"". This initiative marked our practical starting point for integration, inviting enterprises, technology and academic institutions to establish very tightly and well-managed controlled corridors to test real-world applications. The initial results are very promising just over the past nine months. To name a few:


We have achieved a groundbreaking 18-minute cross-sea medical delivery by drone, cutting delivery time by over 60 per cent and proving the efficiency of unmanned logistics.
Partners like the MTR Corporation (MTR Corporation Limited) are integrating and implementing AI-enabled drone systems for railway infrastructure maintenance, surveillance, and preventive maintenance. In a way, they are creating a smart eye in the sky that enhances both safety and efficiency.
Crucially, over a dozen government departments are already adopting low-altitude economy applications by using drones, embedding this new opportunity into the fabric of public services and urban management.


These are not isolated trials. They are the fundamental and foundational steps in helping us to build trust, reliability and operational data for a shared airspace.

Second, we are now advancing to consolidation and complex integration through the LAE ""Regulatory Sandbox X"" scheme, which was just launched two weeks ago. ""X"" in the project's name denotes extra complexity and extended scale, so it is really limitless opportunities. Directly aligned with CANSO's theme, this phase deliberately introduces more sophisticated integration scenarios. We are heading to more challenging scenarios like cross-boundary logistics, using heavier drones and even passenger-carrying drones. Our focus will be on the key modules including an unmanned aircraft traffic management system, eVTOLs and an integrated platform.

The fundamental objective of this phase is to address a critical question before us: What creates outsized economic value while maintaining acceptable risk? It serves as our practical, real-world laboratory for pioneering the harmonisation of both air traffic and unmanned air traffic management system.

And ultimately, our path leads to a codified action plan. By the end of next year, the data and experience from these two phases of ""Regulatory Sandbox"" schemes will help us to culminate data into a comprehensive action plan. Underpinning this roadmap are two essential enablers.

First, an adaptive regulatory framework. We have actually, with the help of the past Legislative Council, already started our legislative amendment exercise. We will also embark on an exercise to map out a dedicated law to enable us to advance to a more complex and integrated low-altitude air traffic management and safety system. Compliance is our top priority. It is a guardrail from the start and absolutely will not be a checkpoint at the end. With the successful implementation of the Legislative Council General Election, we are here to work closely with our new elected Legislative Councillors in partnership so as to advance and expedite our law amendment exercise.

The second enabler is a collaborative ecosystem for regional leadership. Seamless airspace cannot be achieved in isolation. Hong Kong, with our strengths as an international financial centre and a hub for legal and insurance services, is mobilising our capital and risk-management expertise in order to provide solutions for the entire industry. Furthermore, our position in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of the Chinese Mainland gives us unrivalled access to world-class manufacturing and R&D (research and development) hubs. This synergy between Hong Kong's international standards and the region's innovation capacity creates a perfect launchpad for the low-altitude economy. We are actively engaging in global standard-setting technologies and dialogues, including those with ICAO, to ensure the frameworks we develop contribute to regional and global harmonisation.

Ladies and gentlemen, our journey follows a simple, evidence-based cadence: plan, test, learn and decide. We are building more than a low-altitude economy; we are building a blueprint for the seamless, safe, innovative and efficient airspace of the future - not just locally, but globally.

Hong Kong is fully committed to collaborating with all of you - our partners across the Asia-Pacific region and the world - to ensure that our skies remain a realm of limitless opportunities. Together, we will pioneer an airspace where manned and unmanned vehicles integrate seamlessly and safely, fuelling economic growth and connecting our communities in once unimaginable ways.

Thank you again, and I wish you a very fruitful, positive and collaborative conference today. Thank you very much."
