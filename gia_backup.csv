  The Model PECC-cum-Award Presentation Ceremony for the Hong Kong Committee for Pacific Economic Cooperation (HKCPEC) Youth Programme (Youth Programme) 2024/2025 - ""Model PECC – Innovating through Youth Voices"", co-organised by the HKCPEC and the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG) Leadership Institute, was successfully held today (July 6) at the HKFYG Leadership Institute in Fanling. The Chairman of the HKCPEC, Professor Tam Kar-yan, and the Director-General of Trade and Industry, Mr Aaron Liu, were the officiating guests at the Award Presentation Ceremony.

  In his opening remarks, Professor Tam depicted that this year marked the tenth edition of Youth Programme held by the HKCPEC. This year's Programme enabled students to engage in discussions on issues related to economic development in the Asia-Pacific region in a model Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) meeting setting, as well as motivating them to think creatively and contribute meaningfully to regional economic co-operation dialogues.

In his speech, Mr Liu expressed his appreciation for HKCPEC to continue organising the Youth Programme this year, as youth development is one of the priorities of the current term Government. Against the backdrop of a complicated and ever-changing global economic landscape, the Programme provided an opportunity for the younger generation in Hong Kong to deepen their understanding on issues in regional economic co-operation. He also encouraged the students to seize the opportunity to participate in the activities relating to regional economic co-operation in preparation for their future development in the society.

  The theme of this year's Youth Programme is ""Model PECC – Innovating through Youth Voices"", which attracted over 190 secondary students in 74 teams from 46 secondary schools to take part. Participating secondary school students took part in a series of nurturing activities since March, including seminars, workshops and a 24-hour case study, to deepen their understanding on regional economic development and co-operation. In the Model PECC held yesterday (July5) and today, each of the 11shortlisted teams was assigned to represent one of the PECC Member Committees to conduct research and develop policy recommendations on a designated topic, and to present their findings and policy recommendations under a simulated setting of PECC Meeting.

The team formed by Valerie Shek from the Independent Schools Foundation Academy, Adrian Wong and Nika Zhang from Hong Kong International School was awarded the Champion of the competition whereas team from SKH Lam Woo Memorial Secondary School was the first runner-up. Two teams from Maryknoll Convent School (Secondary Section) and Pui Ching Middle School were awarded the second runners-up. Adrian Wong from Hong Kong International School, Ling Man Yin from Maryknoll Convent School (Secondary Section) and Yu Ka Yu from Wa Ying College were awarded the Best Speakers Awards.

  The HKCPEC Youth Programme aims at advancing young people's understanding on regional economic development as well as the role and contributions of Hong Kong in economic and trade development in the Asia-Pacific region; and broadening their knowledge, developing their analytical skills and encouraging their strategic thinking in the process.

  The HKCPEC (www.hkcpec.org) was established in March 1990 to co-ordinate Hong Kong, China's participation in the PECC. In line with the nature of the PECC, the composition of the HKCPEC is tripartite, comprising members from the Government, the business sector and academia.

  The PECC is a non-governmental organisation set up in1980 to develop closer co-operation in trade and economic issues among economies in the region. Currently, the PECC has 24member committees, of which 21are full members. For details, please visit the PECC's website at www.pecc.org."

The year-long Programme, sponsored by The Hong Kong Jockey Club, combines basketball training with anti-drug and crime prevention education. Through organising school seminars, basketball training and tournaments, volunteering service, as well as exchange tours in the Greater Bay Area, values of healthy life are promoted among the youth.

Speaking at the ceremony, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, said that the Programme, firstly launched last year, has achieved remarkable results in delivering crime prevention messages via sports training which is good for the physical and mental well-being. This year, the Programme will be extended to 66 secondary and primary schools across Hong Kong, with nearly 6 000 teachers and students participating.

Mr Chow stated that, it is hoped to convey three important messages to young people through the Programme: to firmly stay away from drugs, especially the recently emerging etomidate, and to strengthen the defence against drug; to establish and reinforce legal awareness and law-abiding behavior as well as safeguarding national security; and to foster correct values, cultivate a caring spirit and a sense of responsibility to contribute to the society. He sincerely thanked The Hong Kong Jockey Club, the Teens and Elderly Mission Committee, schools and community stakeholders for their support and participation.

From January to May this year, 83 youths were arrested for serious drug-related offences, marking a year-on-year increase of 40 per cent. On February 14 this year, the Government has listed etomidate and its three analogues (metomidate, propoxate and isopropoxate) as dangerous drugs. As at May 31, 94 individuals under the age of 21 (the youngest being 12) were arrested for offences related to “space oil drug”.

To promote anti-drug education, besides holding seminars, the Programme also arranges school visits by players from the Hong Kong A1 Division Championship basketball teams to provide professional coaching, aiming to help participants develop a healthy lifestyle and stay away from drugs. At the ceremony, students having joined the Programme last year shared that professional training enhanced their basketball skills and confidence. They also learnt about various scam tactics through the Programme and actively shared crime prevention tips with their families and friends."

警務處處長周一鳴在開展禮致辭時表示，培訓計劃去年首辦，透過有益身心的運動訓練傳遞防罪信息，成效顯著。今年培訓計劃將擴展至全港66間中小學，近6 000名師生參與。

周一鳴指，希望透過培訓計劃向年輕人傳遞三個重要信息：堅決遠離毒品，尤其是近期較盛行的依托咪酯，鞏固禁毒防線；建立和強化識法守法和維護國家安全的意識；以及建立正確價值觀，培養關愛樂助、回饋社會的責任感。他衷心感謝香港賽馬會、天使長行動委員會、學校及社區持份者的支持和參與。

今年一月至五月，涉及嚴重毒品案件被捕的青少年人數為83人，按年上升百分之四十。今年二月十四日，政府將依托咪酯及其三種類似物（即美托咪酯、丙帕酯和異丙帕酯）列為毒品，截至五月三十一日，涉及「太空油毒品」相關案件被捕的21歲以下青少年共94人，當中最年輕的是12歲。

為推廣禁毒教育，培訓計劃除舉辦相關講座外，亦安排香港甲一組聯賽籃球隊成員走進校園，提供專業球技指導，以期學員建立健康的生活模式，遠離毒品。去年參與計劃的學生在開展禮上分享他們在專業球員指導下提升球技和自信，亦透過計劃了解不同的騙案手法，並積極與家人和朋友分享防騙資訊。

Speech by DSJ at International Symposium on Global Corporate Restructuring Center (English only) (with photo),2025-07-06 13:00,2025-07-06 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/06/P2025070600362.htm,"Following are the opening remarks by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung kwok-kwan, at the International Symposium on Global Corporate Restructuring Center today (July 6):

The Honourable Professor Leung (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Deputy to the National People's Congress, Member of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Member of the Legislative Council, Professor Priscilla Leung) , Dr Sun Jin (Director-General of the International Organization for Mediation Preparatory Office), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is my honour to join this International Symposium on Global Corporate Restructuring Centre. We all know that today's global economy is interconnected yet volatile. In order to maintain financial stability and investor confidence, we must keep abreast with market changes and cope with the need of cross-border businesses.

Corporate restructuring is inherently a crucial strategic tool wielded in financial distress, which is vital for survival, renewal and resilience of the businesses. Indeed, successful restructuring preserves value of the businesses. Successful restructuring protects jobs of the employees. Successful restructuring instills confidence of the creditors. In short, successful corporate restructuring allows businesses to navigate adversity and becomes stronger for sustainable growth.

Hong Kong is unique in the sense that it is the only common law jurisdiction in China and is deeply integrated with the Mainland market. It is therefore ideally positioned as a global centre for corporate restructuring. Now, I would like to outline how Hong Kong's legal system delivers unparalleled advantages for business and investment, corporate restructuring and dispute resolution across Asia and beyond.

The Foundation: ""one country, two systems"" and Common Law

Hong Kong's distinctiveness lies in the framework of ""one country, two systems"", which preserves the common law system which is highly regarded by international community and reinforce our unique position to bridge the East and the West. This is not just theoretical - it translates into tangible expertise through our 13 000 solicitors and barristers, 560 Hong Kong lawyers licensed to practice in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), as well as 1 500 registered foreign lawyers, many of whom are multilingual and qualified in multiple jurisdictions. The accounting profession also plays a crucial role in corporate restructuring. We currently have over 6 500 establishments providing accounting, auditing and tax consultancy services. The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants boasts a membership of over 47 000, who are recognised globally in such diverse places as Australia, Canada, England and Wales, South Africa etc.

What does this mean? When international investors face cross-border restructuring or insolvency, they can count on our professionals who master common law principles and international standard as well as the complexities of the Mainland market.

Connectivity: Mutual Legal Assistance

Such expertise is amplified by Hong Kong's unmatched connectivity with the Mainland, offering effective pathways through nine mutual legal assistance arrangements in civil and commercial matters.

Consider this: a European investor restructuring a Mainland-based joint venture could gain critical tools simply by choosing Hong Kong.

Firstly, in assets preservation, businesses may obtain Mainland court orders to freeze assets or preserve evidence — a relief which is not available for arbitration seated in common law jurisdiction other than Hong Kong.

Secondly, in direct enforcement: Businesses may enforce Hong Kong arbitral awards and court judgments in the Mainland, the coverage of which is the widest globally, including judgments on intellectual property rights which are not covered in international conventions.

Thirdly, streamlined restructuring and liquidation: A Hong Kong-appointed liquidator can access Mainland courts in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Xiamen to take control of the company's assets and records in the Mainland, facilitating an effective corporate restructuring or at times, winding up.

This seamless integration makes Hong Kong the optimal choice for business and investment and also cross-border restructuring with Mainland elements.

Dispute Resolution: Arbitration and the New Era of Mediation

Our advantages also extend to dispute resolution. The evidence is compelling — Hong Kong ranked globally number two as an arbitration seat under the 2025 Queen Mary University of London and White & Case International Arbitration Survey; last year, over 76 per cent of the cases handled by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre were international, with claims averaging HK$375 million, reflecting international trust in Hong Kong's role in high-stakes cases.

We recognise that modern challenges require diverse solutions, which is why we are promoting mediation in the Greater Bay Area. The recent establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong highlights this commitment, as the city positions itself as the capital of mediation.

In terms of local capacity building, we have generally mandated mediation clauses in government contracts and have been enhancing training of mediators.

For regional integration, we are closely collaborating with our GBA partners to deploy Hong Kong mediation organisations to handle commercial mediation cases as referred to by the GBA courts; export Hong Kong's best practice to develop GBA standard, including specialised mediation rules; and establish a unified GBA Mediators Panel for cross-border expertise.

The Greater Bay Area: Where Policies Meet Practice

These initiatives reflect Hong Kong’s strategic role in the GBA. Innovative policies have created unprecedented opportunities.

For example, a Shenzhen company with Hong Kong shareholders of any investment ratio can now choose Hong Kong law to govern contracts, and choose Hong Kong as the arbitration seat. And the impact is visible: international investors can benefit from comprehensive legal protection under Hong Kong's common law regime while navigating in Mainland's dynamic markets with certainty and efficiency.

In an era of growing complexity, businesses need to anchor in a jurisdiction that offers stability and connectivity. Hong Kong delivers precisely this – a common law system integrated with the world's second largest economy, powered by world-class professionals conversant in global commerce and a robust and reliable dispute resolution mechanism.

Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you would fully explore the China advantages and the international advantages offered by Hong Kong in today's Symposium. The Government will continue to solidify Hong Kong's role as the premier global hub for business and investment. We support business ventures at every stage – from set-up, financing, management and operation to disputes resolution and restructuring.

On this note, I wish this Symposium every success. Thank you very much."

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-06 11:00,2025-07-06 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/06/P2025070600299.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.
