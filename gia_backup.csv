CHP investigates two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters,2026-02-02 22:20,2026-02-02 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200889.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (February 2) investigating two epidemiologically linked food poisoning clusters affecting a total of four persons. The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The clusters involve one male and three females aged between 30 and 59. They developed diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting and fever about 25 to 38 hours after having dinner at L'Amour located at Shop A & B, G/F, Grand Progress Building, Nos. 58-62 D'Aguilar Street, Nos. 15-16 Lan Kwai Fong, Central, on January 27.

One of the affected persons sought medical advice but did not require hospitalisation.All of the affected individuals are currently in stable condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that raw oysters and salad were the food items that the affected individuals had in common at the aforementioned restaurant. Officers of the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch) conducted a joint investigation and examined the handling processes and food hygiene at the restaurant. The CFS's field investigation revealed that affected persons may have contracted food poisoning from consuming raw food. The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend serving the incriminated food items and to carry out cleaning and disinfection of the premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

The investigation of the CHP and the CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children, are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

CFS continues to follow up certain batches of powdered infant and young children formula with possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus,2026-02-02 21:42,2026-02-02 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200821.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to actively follow up on the precautionary recall of certain batches of powdered infant and young children formula in different areas worldwide due to possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus in the individual raw material.

Nestlé Hong Kong had already stopped sales and removed the 22 affected batches (including the aforementioned three batches) of products from shelves, and had initiated a precautionary recall earlier. According to Nestlé Hong Kong, as of January 30, about 159 000 cans of affected products had been recalled. The CFS and Nestlé Hong Kong have jointly followed up, marked and sealed 233 000 cans of suspected affected batches of infant and young children formula products, including those kept in warehouse and those already recalled. An additional 16 suspected affected batches are currently en route to Hong Kong and will also be marked and sealed upon arrival.

From January 7 to 4pm on February 2, the FEHD received a total of 48 food complaints and enquiries suspected to be related to the infant and young children formula products. The CFS and the Environmental Hygiene Branch have promptly followed up on these cases, including contacting the parties concerned to obtain details and collecting samples for testing. In addition, the CFS has referred the cases to the health authority for follow-up.

The CFS has enhanced surveillance of the relevant powdered infant and young children formula. Since January this year, a total of 171 samples have been collected for various microbiological and chemical tests. Together with the five samples announced in the CFS's press release on January 24, a total of 10 samples have so far tested positive for Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus, all were among the 22 batches of Nestlé Hong Kong products that were previously recalled and are no longer available on the market. The test results of the remaining 161 samples were satisfactory. Follow-up investigation by the CFS is still ongoing. In addition, the CFS is pursuing the cases involving samples tested positive for Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus, and will initiate prosecution procedures if sufficient evidence is available.

The CFS will continue to closely monitor the recall matters and remain fully committed to ensuring food safety. Follow up investigation is ongoing.

Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

The spokesman urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the 22 affected batches of the products, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the products concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of the products immediately.

The CFS has established a designated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/powdered_formula/index.html) to facilitate public access to more information."

Speech by FS at Financial Services Development Council Annual Cocktail Reception 2026 (English only)(with photos),2026-02-02 20:58,2026-02-02 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200794.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Financial Services Development Council (FSDC) Annual Cocktail Reception 2026 today (February 2):

Benjamin (Chairman of the FSDC, Mr Benjamin Hung), FSDC Board Members, King (Executive Director of the FSDC, Dr King Au), Rocky (Executive Director-designate of the FSDC, Dr Rocky Tung), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is a pleasure to join you tonight at the Financial Services Development Council's annual cocktail reception. This gathering is a welcome opportunity to reconnect with friends and partners across our financial community - and to look ahead as we begin a new year.

2025 was a good year for Hong Kong's financial services sector. We saw solid momentum across multiple segments and a renewed sense of confidence, but we should be clear-eyed. In a geopolitically fast-moving and complex world, compounded by technology disruptions, we must never stop moving. The question is how to position Hong Kong for the next phase of high quality and resilient growth.

Two weeks ago, I was in Davos. The discussions among world leaders on the global arena were highly relevant to Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre.

First, asset reallocation. In a world marked by heightened geopolitical tensions, many global investors are reassessing exposures, seeking greater diversification and looking to allocate more to markets where policy clarity, connectivity and compelling opportunities converge.

Second, technological transformation is creating new investment opportunities. The global community expressed strong and sustained interest in AI, quantum computing, robotics, biotech and new energy. With our country advancing rapidly in these areas, new avenues are opening up for long term capital deployment.

Against this backdrop, Hong Kong's enduring value proposition is clear. We are not only an international financial centre connecting China and the world; we are also an emerging international innovation and technology hub that attracts global talent and capital. One focus of our next phase of development will be very much on this dual role, where we harness our capital markets to power technological innovation and drive the real economy.

In this light, the work of the FSDC continues to be both important and impactful. The Council continues to look ahead to the frontiers of financial services, and I am delighted that it has been putting forward concrete recommendations in several high potential areas.

One example is developing our bond market, and that includes deepening the ecosystem and broadening funding channels to meet growing investor interest in high quality fixed income and longer-tenor instruments. Another is impact investing, where Hong Kong can leverage our position as a trusted international platform, to mobilise capital to support low carbon transition, inclusive growth and philanthropy.

I would like to thank the FSDC for its continued contributions through policy research, market engagement and international outreach. Your work helps sharpen our thinking on how we can reinforce Hong Kong's attractiveness as a preferred market to invest and grow.

Finally, on a personal note, may I extend my warmest wishes to Dr King Au, Executive Director of the FSDC, on his retirement from the Council. King, we are grateful for your dedicated and outstanding service for the past six years.

Ladies and gentlemen, in about two weeks, we will be celebrating the Year of the Horse, an emblem of vitality, agility and perseverance, which are the very qualities that sustain Hong Kong's success on the global stage. Looking ahead, despite complex headwinds, I remain confident that Hong Kong will continue to thrive as an international financial centre of choice.

For now, I hope you will enjoy the evening and the company, over a drink or two. Thank you very much."

"FEHD holds awards ceremony to commend property management agents, owners' corporations and district organisations for assisting in tackling dripping air conditioners (with photos)",2026-02-02 20:15,2026-02-02 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200763.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (February 2) held the Awards Ceremony for Tackling Dripping Air-conditioners 2025 to commend and express gratitude to property management agents (PMAs), owners' corporations and district organisations for their dedicated efforts and contributions over the past year through active participation in the Scheme of Participation by Property Management Agents in Tackling Dripping Air-conditioners. The ceremony also echoed the department's slogan, ""Fix Air-con Drips, Harmony Comes Without Gripe"", encouraging more organisations and citizens to join hands in paying attention to and properly addressing dripping air conditioner issues, so as to improve the community environment together.

A spokesman for the FEHD said the department has been adopting a multipronged approach to tackle dripping air conditioner issues. The FEHD stepped up inspections and enforcement across districts in Hong Kong last summer. By combining publicity and education, the application of innovative technology and adjustments to operational strategies, the measures have achieved notable results.

The spokesman said, ""The FEHD has handled a cumulative total of approximately 8 600 dripping air conditioners in 2025, a number that has risen by approximately three times compared to 2023, and recorded an increase of more than 30 per cent compared to 2024. The problem of dripping air conditioners has shown considerable improvement at locations identified as black spots.""

The FEHD adopted a new operational strategy last year. In addition to sustaining the effort in handling public complaints, FEHD officers proactively conducted door-to-door inspections and took enforcement action at about 300 key follow-up locations with dripping air conditioners across districts. Thirty dripping black spots causing significant nuisance to the public, including bus stops, minibus stops and pedestrian passages, were also targeted, with enforcement actions conducted at least once a week. To address the prevalence of dripping issues during night-time and early morning hours, the department reallocated manpower for investigations, shifting from the previous 70 per cent daytime and 30 per cent night-time distribution to 30 per cent daytime and 70 per cent night-time.

By leveraging innovative technology, the FEHD also collaborated with the Logistics and Supply Chain MultiTech R&D Centre under the Innovation and Technology Commission to develop the Dripping Air Conditioner Investigation System. Equipped with infrared night-vision recording, the system can quickly identify the source of dripping at night or in low-light conditions. With a detection range of up to 120 metres, it can cover buildings of around 40 stories high, significantly reducing the time required for investigation and evidence collection and enhancing work efficiency.

In addition, the FEHD strengthened publicity and education in collaboration with District Council members, district organisations, owners' corporations and PMAs. Leaflets and posters were distributed, promotional materials were displayed at bus stops, and feature videos were released through social media, radio and television, reminding the public to check their air conditioners regularly and promptly address any dripping issues to avoid creating a nuisance.

The spokesperson emphasised that PMAs play a key role at the district level. The FEHD collaborated with the Property Management Services Authority to develop the Best Practice Guide on Handling Dripping Air Conditioners, providing guidance for licensed PMAs and property management personnel. Moreover, as PMAs are familiar with the situation of their housing estates and the residents, they are capable of handling the issue of dripping air conditioners in housing estates effectively. Therefore, the FEHD initiated the Scheme to solicit the assistance of PMAs in handling complaints about dripping air conditioners in private housing estates during the summer season (from May to November). Currently, over 290 PMAs are participating in the Scheme. On average, over 5 000 complaints against dripping air conditioners were followed up and handled through the Scheme annually in the past three years.

To commend participating PMAs, as well as owners' corporations and district organisations assisting in the implementation of the new strategy, the FEHD held an awards ceremony today to express gratitude for their efforts.

The spokesman added, ""PMAs, owners' corporations, District Council members and district organisations play an important role in addressing dripping air conditioners and other environmental hygiene matters. The FEHD looks forward to continuing and enhancing co-operation with them to create a better living environment for the public.""

The FEHD calls on members of the public to check their air conditioners regularly and take immediate action if water dripping happens.

食環署頒獎典禮表揚協助處理冷氣機滴水的物管公司、大廈業主立案法團和地區團體（附圖）,2026-02-02 20:15,2026-02-02 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200760.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（二月二日）舉行「2025《協助處理冷氣機滴水》頒獎典禮」，以表揚及感謝積極參與物業管理公司協助處理冷氣機滴水事故計劃的物業管理公司、大廈業主立案法團和地區團體過去一年的努力和貢獻。是次活動亦響應署方宣傳口號「冷氣滴水處理好社區和諧無煩惱」，鼓勵更多團體與市民攜手關注並妥善處理冷氣機滴水問題，共同改善社區環境。

食環署發言人表示，署方持續以多管齊下方式打擊冷氣機滴水問題，去年夏季在全港各區加強巡查及執管，並結合宣傳教育、創新科技應用及行動策略調整，取得一定成效。

發言人說：「食環署二○二五年累計已處理約8 600部冷氣機的滴水問題，較二○二三年多出約三倍，與二○二四年比較亦增加超過三成。當中，在署方鎖定的黑點，冷氣機滴水問題有顯著改善。」

食環署去年採取全新行動策略，除繼續處理市民投訴外，署方人員主動出擊，以「洗樓」形式重點跟進各區約300個冷氣機滴水地點，亦鎖定30個對市民造成較大滋擾的黑點，包括巴士站、小巴站及行人通道等，展開每星期最少一次的執法行動。因應滴水問題多在夜間及清晨出現，署方亦調整調查人手分配，由以往日間七成、夜間三成，改為日間三成、夜間七成。

食環署亦積極應用創新科技，與創新科技署轄下的物流及供應鏈多元技術研發中心合作研發冷氣機滴水調查系統。該系統配備紅外線夜視錄像功能，能在夜間或低光環境下快速鎖定滴水源頭，偵測範圍達120米，足以覆蓋約40層高的大廈，大幅縮短調查取證時間，成效顯著。

此外，食環署與各界協作加強宣傳教育，包括與區議員、地區團體、大廈業主立案法團及物管公司派發宣傳單張和海報、在巴士站張貼宣傳海報，並透過社交媒體、電台及電視台等發布專題短片，呼籲市民定期檢查冷氣機，及早處理滴水問題，以免造成滋擾。

發言人強調，物管公司在地區層面扮演關鍵角色。食環署與物業管理業監管局共同制定「處理冷氣機滴水問題」良好作業指南，為持牌物管公司及人員提供相關指引。此外，物管公司熟悉屋苑情況並與居民熟稔，能有效處理屋苑內的冷氣機滴水問題。因此，食環署在私人屋苑推行計劃，邀請物管公司在夏季（五月至十一月）協助處理冷氣機滴水投訴。現時有290多個私人屋苑的物管公司參與計劃，過去三年平均每年完成跟進和處理五千多宗冷氣機滴水投訴個案。

為嘉許積極參與計劃的物管公司，以及協助推行行動策略的大廈業主立案法團和地區團體，食環署今日舉行頒獎典禮，感謝他們的努力。

發言人說：「物管公司、大廈業主立案法團、區議員和地區團體在處理冷氣機滴水以至其他環境衞生事宜上均擔當重要角色，食環署期待與他們繼續加強合作，為市民營造更理想的居住環境。」

食環署呼籲市民定期檢查冷氣機，如發現滴水問題應盡快處理。更多資訊可參閱食環署網頁上的小冊子（www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/library/aircon/Pamphlet_water_dripping_from_air_conditioner.pdf）。"

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2026-02-02 17:30,2026-02-02 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200649.htm,"An incoming male passenger was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and fined $600 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (February 2) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted a 48-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on January 11 and seized 2 665 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $11,000 and a duty potential of about $8,800 from his personal baggage and on his body. He was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Members of the public should not defy the law.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-02 17:30,2026-02-02 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200622.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月二日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-02 17:30,2026-02-02 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200619.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 2), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Housing Bureau awards two operation and management contracts of Light Public Housing projects (with photo),2026-02-02 17:27,2026-02-02 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200486.htm,"The Housing Bureau (HB) today (February 2) awarded the seventh and the eighth operation and management contracts of the Light Public Housing (LPH) projects (Contract No. LPH20250005 and LPH20250006) to Creative Property Services Consultants Limited - Pok Oi Hospital Joint Venture, at tender sums of about $200.6 million and $159.7 million respectively.

The seventh and the eighth contracts cover the projects at Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 2A) and (Phase 2B), which will provide about 4 500 and 3 250 units respectively. A total of about 7 750 units is expected to be completed gradually for tenant intake in the third quarter of this year.

The Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, said, ""Under the leadership of the HB, six projects providing a total of about 9 500 units were completed for tenant intake last year. The project at Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak, which is the largest LPH project providing a total of about 10 700 units, will be completed in two phases and benefit tens of thousands of families. Among them, the Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 1) LPH, with approximately 3 000 units, commenced intake in December last year and is expected to be fully occupied within the coming one to two weeks. I am glad to see that another 3 000 families that faced many difficulties in the past can now live in a much better, safer and tidier environment to ring in the Chinese New Year. With the appointment of the operating organisations for Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 2A) and (Phase 2B) LPH today, this social project will further benefit nearly 20 000 people and enable about 7 750 families in need to live a better life.""

  ""The two contracts are awarded to Creative Property Services Consultants Limited - Pok Oi Hospital Joint Venture. With the synergy of the two highly experienced organisations, sharing of resources can be achieved in the overall operation and management, thereby enhancing cost-effectiveness. I expect that the two operators responsible for the LPH at Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak, will deepen collaboration, foster mutual benefits, and work wholeheartedly to build a caring and inclusive community, so that both our residents and the neighbourhood can benefit from the high-quality property management and targeted social services. I would also like to appeal to other organisations that are interested in operating LPH projects to actively participate in the tenders for the remaining two projects, and work together with the Government to improve the living environment of the grassroots and help them in their pursuit of happiness,"" she added.

In addition to providing accommodation, the LPH projects will also offer various services and facilities for the residents and local communities nearby. Therefore, unlike general property management contracts, the requirements for LPH's operation and management services not only cover occupant management, property management, and daily maintenance but also a range of social services (such as facilitating residents' integration into the community, providing assistance in job seeking and schooling, offering support to the elderly and persons with disabilities, and providing services for children and social work support), as well as the management and operation of ancillary facilities (such as retail and catering facilities, a reading room and study/activity rooms).

To ensure service quality, the HB has, in the assessment process, carried out a technical assessment based on a series of criteria including the management capability and relevant experience of the tenderers, as well as the proposed modes of operation and management, social services to be provided, exit plan and the use of innovation and information technology. The tender price was then comprehensively evaluated to decide on the most suitable operating organisation.

The response to LPH applications has been overwhelming, with about 28 952 applications received by end-January this year. This fully demonstrates that with affordable rent, comprehensive facilities and services, as well as a better living environment, LPH projects are highly popular among citizens currently facing housing difficulties.

  Besides, LPH has been opened for Phase 3 application since January 30, covering the projects at Sheung On Street, Chai Wan; Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 2); Yan Po Road, Tuen Mun; and Tsing Fat Street, Tuen Mun, which will provide a total of about 8 820 units for gradual intake anticipated from the second quarter of this year onwards.

HKPF and INTERPOL co-organise INTERPOL's Cybercrime Expert Group In-Person Annual Meeting (with photos),2026-02-02 17:23,2026-02-02 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200651.htm,"The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and INTERPOL are co-organising the INTERPOL's Cybercrime Expert Group (CyberEX) In-Person Annual Meeting today and tomorrow (February 2 and 3), under the theme ""Disrupting the Industrialisation of Cybercrime"". The event has attracted over 120 participants, including law enforcement officers and experts from the industry and international organisations from more than 30 countries/regions. The meeting, being held in Hong Kong for the first time, highlighted the Force's close co-operation with law enforcement agencies worldwide in international policing, as well as its influence in the global stage of combating cybercrime.

In his opening remarks, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, said that there is no challenge more borderless, or more urgent, than cybercrime today. To address the threat, the Force is committed to developing next-generation technologies, fostering public-private partnerships, and creating a public safety ecosystem through various collaboration platforms, advanced technology projects, and industrial participation.

He cited as an example that the Force, having noted emerging trends in virtual asset-related crimes, engaged with the Web3 industry last year to establish the Virtual Asset Intelligence Taskforce as a public-private co-operation platform. This brings together regulators and licensed service providers to jointly address challenges posed by Web3 technology, and promote innovation and security in digital asset development. The Force has also developed an automated system, CryptoTrace, to visualise virtual asset investigations and fully support investigators within the Force.

Mr Chow emphasised that cybercrime respects no borders, and effective combat requires strengthened cross-border co-operation, cross-sector partnerships, and continuous capacity building. Today's meeting serves as a platform bringing together international law enforcement agencies, academia, and the industry to transform collective insight into collective impact against cybercrime through experience sharing, intelligence exchange, and co-ordinated action.

He added that the 94th INTERPOL General Assembly will be held in Hong Kong this year. The HKPF will continue to maintain close liaison with INTERPOL to further strengthen international policing co-operation, deepen partnerships, and combat cross-border cybercrime syndicates.

The INTERPOL Cybercrime Director, Mr Neal Jetton, thanked the HKPF for jointly hosting the meeting and promoting cross-border collaboration. He noted that the meeting demonstrated Hong Kong's proactive role as a key hub for international policing co-operation, and expressed hope that the meeting would achieve practical solutions and collective action to effectively combat and dismantle cybercrime.

The Chief Superintendent of the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau of the HKPF, Mr Lam Cheuk-ho, chaired the meeting as the Chairman of CyberEx. He emphasised the importance of international co-operation, professional training, and cross-sector collaboration in response to the trend of cybercrime industrialisation.

The meeting provides a platform for law enforcement experts, technology companies, and relevant stakeholders from around the world to engage in in-depth discussions on combating the cybercrime industry supply chain, covering multiple topics including cybercrime ecosystems, online extortion, artificial intelligence (AI), and virtual asset tracing. The participants shared and exchanged views on cross-border intelligence exchange, co-ordinated operations, and capacity building. The meeting also featured multiple exhibition booths showcasing the latest AI technologies and products, allowing participants to explore the latest developments in various technologies and innovative technology applications.

The HKPF will continue to maintain close co-operation with local and overseas partners, enhancing the overall effectiveness of combating cross-border cybercrime through intelligence exchange, capacity building, and co-ordinated operations, safeguarding the security and confidence of the public and enterprises in the digital era."

警務處處長周一鳴致辭時表示，現今沒有任何挑戰較網絡罪行更具跨境性和迫切性。為應對有關威脅，香港警隊致力發展嶄新技術、促進公私營合作，並透過多元協作平台、尖端科技項目及業界參與，共同建立一個公共安全生態系統。

他舉例說，香港警隊留意到虛擬資產相關犯罪的新興趨勢，去年與Web 3產業接洽，成立虛擬資產情報工作組，作為公私營合作平台，匯聚監管機構與持牌服務供應商，共同應對Web 3技術帶來的挑戰，並推動數位資產發展的創新與安全。警隊同時開發虛擬資產追蹤系統CryptoTrace，視覺化呈現虛擬資產調查過程，並全面支援警隊的調查人員。

周一鳴強調，網絡罪行無彊界，要有效打擊，必須加強跨境合作、跨界別夥伴關係，以及持續提升應對能力。是次會議正是一個匯聚國際執法機關、學術界和業界的平台，通過經驗分享、情報交流和聯合行動，將集體智慧轉化為打擊網絡罪行的力量。

他指，第94屆國際刑警組織周年大會今年將在香港舉行，香港警隊與國際刑警組織將繼續保持緊密聯繫，進一步加強國際警務合作，深化夥伴關係，打擊跨境網路犯罪集團。

國際刑警組織網絡犯罪主管Neal Jetton發言時感謝香港警務處合辦會議，共同推動跨境協作。他指出，是次會議充分展現香港作為國際警務合作樞紐的積極角色，期望會議能推進切實可行的解決方案和聯合行動，有效打擊並瓦解網絡罪行。

香港警務處網絡安全及科技罪案調查科總警司林焯豪以專家組主席身分主持會議。會上，他強調在網絡罪行產業化的趨勢下，國際合作、專業培訓及跨界別協作模式的重要性。

是次會議提供平台予來自世界各地的執法機構專家、科技公司和相關持份者，就打擊網絡罪行產業鏈作深入探討，涵蓋多個議題，包括網絡罪行生態、網上勒索、人工智能，以及虛擬資產追蹤等。與會者亦就跨境情報交流、協同行動，以及能力建設等進行分享和交流。會議同時設置多個攤位，展示最新人工智能技術和產品，讓與會者即場探討各種科技的最新發展、創新技術應用等。"
​房委會公布西環邨和馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建計劃的清拆及遷置安排,2026-02-02 17:09,2026-02-02 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200309.htm,"下稿代香港房屋委員會發出：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）今日（二月二日）公布西環邨和馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建計劃的清拆及遷置安排。

房委會轄下策劃小組委員會今早討論上述兩項計劃。商業樓宇小組委員會和資助房屋小組委員會其後在聯席會議上通過對受西環邨及馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建計劃影響的住宅及商業租戶的遷置及相關安排。

西環邨重建計劃的清拆及遷置安排

西環邨的清拆及遷置將一次過進行。受影響住戶由今日起至二○二九年九月的目標清空日期內，有多於40個月的通知期安排遷出單位。鄰近的加惠民道第一期公營房屋發展項目將會用作接收屋邨，提供足夠的公屋單位讓西環邨街坊鄰里一同搬遷，保留原來屋邨的人情溫暖及延續對社區的歸屬感。

馬頭圍邨重建計劃的第一期清拆及遷置安排

馬頭圍邨將會分兩期重建，第一期清拆的樓宇包括洋葵樓和水仙樓。受影響住戶由今日起至二○二九年七月的目標清空日期內，有多於40個月的通知期安排遷出單位。土瓜灣道公營房屋發展項目和部分新美東邨公營房屋發展項目會用作接收受第一期清拆影響的住戶，令重建期數由三期縮減至兩期，搬遷所有居民的時間亦由14年大幅縮減至七年。

與民共議凝聚社區

房委會根據在社區參與活動及區議會諮詢中收集到的持份者意見進行以下重建相關安排。

（一）多元遷置選擇

受影響住戶可按其需要選擇不同的遷置選項。受西環邨和馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建計劃影響的住戶除了可選擇遷往接收屋邨外，亦可選擇遷往其他地區的合適翻新公屋單位，並可優先選購於目標清空日期前推售的資助出售單位。

（二）津貼詳情

受影響的住戶將獲發放住戶搬遷津貼，視乎住戶家庭人數，金額由10,350元至33,050元不等，以協助他們支付部分搬遷開支。合資格單身人士和二人家庭住戶亦可選擇領取現金，即替代配屋津貼，以代替入住公屋。今日的聯席會議亦通過單身人士和二人家庭的替代配屋津貼金額分別為82,700元及100,220元。

（三）社區服務隊

房委會會為西環邨和馬頭圍邨成立駐邨社區服務隊，與受影響住戶保持溝通，尤其是長者，並為他們提供服務，包括協助他們遷離現時居住單位及適應新居住環境等。

（四）邨內調遷安排

房委會會協助受馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建影響的有需要住戶（二人或以上家庭，特別是長者戶）進行邨內調遷。現居於馬頭圍邨（第一期）清拆樓宇的住戶，如有特別情況需要調遷往第二期的樓宇，可以提出申請，房委會會酌情處理。而由於西環邨的接收屋邨可以一次過容納所有受重建影響的居民，因此無須安排邨內調遷。

（五）保留邨內特色商舖

以往為華富邨及彩虹邨商戶特設的招標安排亦同樣適用於設有商舖的馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建計劃。為保留邨內特色商舖及延續其文化情懷，房委會會透過社區參與活動發掘馬頭圍邨別具特色和值得保留的商戶，讓他們以特設性投標競投在接收屋邨或原址重建邨預留的新商業單位。房委會將收集意見及了解受影響商戶的意向，再敲定細節。另外，受馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建計劃影響的所有合資格商戶皆可獲發放金額相等於正式公布清拆安排當日於租約內所訂明每月淨額租金15倍的特惠津貼，並可參與特設性投標以競投房委會現有零售設施內的指定空置商舖。若商戶選擇不參與或未能在特設性投標中中標，便會獲發放一筆過替代津貼113,500元。

房委會將繼續與居民溝通，並按西環邨及馬頭圍邨（第一期）重建計劃的進度，適時公布最新消息及發展。"
HA announces clearance and rehousing arrangements for redevelopment of Sai Wan Estate and Phase 1 of Ma Tau Wai Estate,2026-02-02 17:09,2026-02-02 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200314.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Housing Authority:

  The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) announced today (February 2) the clearance and rehousing arrangements for the redevelopment of Sai Wan Estate (SWE) and Phase 1 of Ma Tau Wai Estate (MTWE).​

  The HA's Strategic Planning Committeediscussed the above two plans this morning. The Commercial Properties Committee and the Subsidised Housing Committee, at a joint meeting, subsequently approved the rehousing and associated arrangements for the domestic and commercial tenants affected by the SWE and MTWE (Phase 1) redevelopment plans.
​
Clearance and rehousing arrangements for redevelopment of SWE

  The clearance and rehousing of SWE will be carried out in one go. Affected tenants will have a notification period of more than 40 months before the target clearance date in September 2029 for making arrangements to move out of their units. Phase 1 of the Ka Wai Man Road public housing development nearby will serve as the reception estate, providing sufficient public rental housing (PRH) units for SWE tenants to move together with their neighbours, maintaining warm neighbourhood relationships and continuing the sense of community.

Clearance and rehousing arrangements for Phase 1 redevelopment of MTWE

  MTWE will be redeveloped in two phases, with Phase 1 clearance covering Geranium House and Narcissus House. Affected tenants will have a notification period of more than 40 months before the target clearance date in July 2029 for making arrangements to move out of their units. The To Kwa Wan Road public housing development and part of the new Mei Tung Estate public housing development will serve as the reception estates for tenants affected by the Phase 1 clearance, reducing the number of redevelopment phases from three to two, hence significantly shortening the rehousing period for all MTWE residents from 14 years to seven years.

Public participation to improve the community

  Based on the views of stakeholders collected during the community engagement activities and District Council consultation, the HA will carry out the associated arrangements of the redevelopment.

(1) Diverse rehousing options

  Affected households can select from different rehousing options to suit their needs. Tenants affected by the SWE and MTWE (Phase 1) redevelopment plans may choose to move either to reception estates or to suitable and refurbished PRH units in other districts, and will be accorded priority to purchase subsidised sale flats launched for sale before the target clearance date.

(2) Details of allowance

  Affected households will be offered a Domestic Removal Allowance ranging from $10,350 to $33,050, depending on the household size, to help cover part of their moving expenses. Eligible one-person and two-person households may also opt for cash in lieu of rehousing to a PRH unit under the Alternative Rehousing Allowance, with the rates for one-person households and two-person households endorsed at the joint meeting today standing at $82,700 and $100,220 respectively.

(3) Community service teams

  The HA will set up on-site community service teams at SWE and MTWE to maintain communication between the HA and affected households, in particular elderly people, and to provide them services, including support in moving out of their current units and adapting to their new living environment.

(4) Internal transfer arrangements

  The HA will take care of the households in need during the MTWE (Phase 1) redevelopment (for families of two or more, especially elderly households) through internal transfer. Tenants who have special circumstances may apply for transfer to a unit in Phase 2 of MTWE. The applications will be considered with discretion. No internal transfer arrangements are necessary for SWE as the reception estate can accommodate all of the affected tenants in one go.

(5) Preserving featured shops in the estate

  The tailor-made tender arrangements previously adopted for the commercial tenants in Wah Fu Estate and Choi Hung Estate will also apply to the retail shops in Phase 1 of the MTWE redevelopment. To preserve featured shops with cultural affinities in the estate, the HA will identify shops with unique characteristics and values of retention through community engagement exercises, and engage the shop tenants in bidding for new commercial premises reserved in the reception estates or the redeveloped estates by way of restricted tenders. The HA will gauge the views of the community as well as the intention of affected shop tenants before finalising the detailed arrangements. Moreover, all eligible commercial tenants affected by the MTWE (Phase 1) redevelopment will be offered ex-gratia allowances equivalent to 15 times the monthly exclusive rent as specified in the tenancy agreement applicable on the day of the formal announcement of the clearance, and will be allowed to participate in the restricted tender exercises to lease selected vacant shops in the HA's existing retail facilities. If the retail tenants choose not to participate or are unsuccessful in the restricted tender exercises, they will be granted a lump sum payment of $113,500 in lieu.

  The HA will continue to communicate with the residents and announce the latest news and development in due course based on the progress of the SWE and MTWE (Phase 1) redevelopment plans."

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2026-02-02 17:00,2026-02-02 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200602.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 2) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From January 25 to 31, the CHP recorded one community-acquired and one imported LD case. Both patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


a 57-year-old male patient living in Yuen Long District, classified as a community-acquired case; and
an 82-year-old male patient who travelled to Australia during the incubation period, classified as an imported case.


​The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these two cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

  As of January 31, seven LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2025 and 2024, there were 167 and 135 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpool spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or ships.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) or less and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.


​The public may visit the CHP'sLD page, theCode of Practice for Prevention of LDand theHousekeeping Guidelines for Cold and Hot Water Systems for Building Managementof the Prevention of LD Committee, and the CHP'srisk-based strategyfor prevention and control of LD.

Additionally, as smokers and alcoholics are more susceptible to LD, the Government urgesmembers of the public to quit smoking and avoid drinking. Members of the public may call the DH Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline at 1833 183, which is answered by registered nurses who provide professional counselling and referral to a wide range of free smoking cessation services. The public may also visit the smoking cessation thematic website (www.livetobaccofree.hk) for more information on smoking cessation.

二○二五年第四季中小企貸款狀況調查,2026-02-02 16:30,2026-02-02 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200577.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（二月二日）公布二○二五年第四季「中小企貸款狀況調查」結果。調查顯示，中小企信貸狀況大致保持穩定。

關於中小企對銀行貸款批核取態（即難易程度）的觀感，撇除回答「沒意見／不知道」的受訪者，70%認為銀行在二○二五年第四季貸款批核的取態與六個月前相比「沒有分別」或「較容易」，高於前一季的59%（附件圖1）。30%認為銀行的有關取態「較困難」，而上一季度則為41%。貸款較困難的觀感並不一定反映中小企在借貸上遇到實質困難，而是可以受多項因素（如媒體／新聞報道、生意經營狀況及親友的意見等）所影響。

在已獲批貸款的受訪者中，1%表示銀行對其貸款的取態有所「收緊」，較前一季的3%下降（附件圖2）。在本調查中，貸款收緊的含義包括各種可能，例如降低備用信貸額和貸款額、信貸利率上升、增加抵押品要求或縮短貸款年期等。因此，受訪者表示銀行對其貸款的取態並不直接反映銀行實際對中小企的貸款投放。

調查亦收集有關中小企新貸款申請的結果。2%受訪者表示曾於二○二五年第四季向銀行申請新貸款。在已知申請結果的受訪者中，表示申請完全成功或部分成功的受訪者佔77%，高於前一季的72%（附件圖3）。

由於季內有已獲批貸款的中小企及有申請新貸款的中小企數目較少，分別僅佔受訪中小企的14%及2%，調查結果容易出現較大波動，詮釋時需要注意。

關於「中小企貸款狀況調查」

鑑於中小企對香港經濟的重要性，以及過去幾年中小企可能面對融資困難，金管局委託香港生產力促進局由二○一六年第三季起進行是項調查。調查按季進行，每次涵蓋約2 500間不同行業的中小企。調查結果有助從需求角度了解中小企獲得銀行貸款的狀況。

讀者需要小心詮釋調查結果。正如其他意見調查一樣，調查期間可能會出現特殊事件影響到受訪者的觀感，令調查結果變得波動。讀者在詮釋調查結果時應同時參考其他經濟及金融資訊。此外，收集所得意見僅反映受訪者對不同季度之間預期變動的趨勢（例如「收緊」、「沒有改變」或「放寬」），而並非具體變動的幅度。

Survey on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' Credit Conditions for fourth quarter 2025,2026-02-02 16:30,2026-02-02 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200576.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (February 2) the results of the Survey on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)' Credit Conditions for the fourth quarter of 2025. According to the survey, SMEs' credit conditions remained broadly stable.

  Regarding SMEs' perception of banks' credit approval stance relative to six months ago, excluding respondents who answered ""no idea/don't know"", 70 per cent perceived a ""similar"" or ""easier"" credit approval stance in the fourth quarter of 2025, up from 59per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 1 in the Annex). 30per cent perceived a ""more difficult"" credit approval stance, compared to 41per cent in the previous quarter. The perception of a more difficult credit approval stance may not necessarily reflect actual difficulties faced by SMEs in obtaining bank credit as the perception could be affected by a number of factors, such as media/news reports, business conditions and opinions of relatives and friends.

  Among respondents with existing credit lines, 1 per cent reported a ""tighter"" banks' stance, down from 3 per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 2 in the Annex). In this survey, a tighter stance on existing credit lines denotes a range of possible measures or arrangements, such as reducing unused and used credit lines, raising the interest rate, imposing additional collateral requirements, or shortening loan tenor. Therefore, respondents' indication of banks' stance on existing credit lines may not directly reflect banks' supply of credit to SMEs.

  The survey also gauged the results of new credit applications from SMEs. 2 per cent of the respondents reported that they had applied for new bank credit during the fourth quarter of 2025. Among the respondents who had already known their application outcomes, 77 per cent reported fully or partially successful applications, up from 72per cent in the previous quarter (Chart 3 in the Annex).

  Owing to small sample sizes of SMEs with existing credit lines (14 per centof surveyed SMEs) and with new credit applications (2per cent of surveyed SMEs) during the quarter, the results could be prone to large fluctuations, and hence should be interpreted with care.

About Survey on SMEs' Credit Conditions

  In light of the importance of SMEs to the Hong Kong economy and concerns about potential funding difficulties facing SMEs over the past few years, the HKMA has appointed the Hong Kong Productivity Council (HKPC) to carry out this survey, starting from the third quarter of 2016. This survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, covering about 2 500 SMEs from different economic sectors each time. The results of this survey can help monitor the development of SMEs' access to bank credit from a demand-side perspective.

  The results of this survey should be interpreted with caution. Similar to other opinion surveys, views collected in this survey may be affected by changes in sentiment due to idiosyncratic events that occurred over the survey period, which can make the results prone to fluctuations. Readers are advised to interpret the results together with other economic and financial information. In addition, views collected are limited to the expected direction of inter-quarter changes (e.g. ""tighter"", ""no change"" or ""easier"") without providing information about the magnitude of these changes.

  Detailed tables and technical information of this survey are published on the website of the HKPC (smecc.hkpc.org)."

Consul General（意大利駐香港及澳門總領事Carmelo Ficarra）、Edgar（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會義務秘書長楊祖賜）、寶基（2026冬季奧運會中國香港代表團團長黃寶基）、各位嘉賓、各位運動員、各位朋友：

大家好。我很高興出席今日的授旗典禮，為出戰第二十五屆冬季奧運會（冬奧）的中國香港健兒加油打氣和授旗。

在二○○二年，中國香港代表團首次參加冬季奧運會，當年在美國鹽湖城。多年來，體育總會積極培訓有潛質的運動員，令冰雪運動能在香港這個「無雪之城」扎根發展，近年更得到國家大力支持，不論在場地和教練方面都提供大量支援，讓我們漸漸取得突破。剛才楊秘書長提到我們在滑冰項目和冰壺也有好成績。滑冰項目已發展為香港體育學院的「A級」精英體育項目，在國際賽事屢獲佳績。在去年哈爾濱亞洲冬季運動會，香港運動員更創下歷屆最好成績，中國香港男子冰壺隊歷史性取得第四名，而高山滑雪選手亦躋身頭十名，充分展現了中國香港運動員在冰雪運動的潛質和能力。

今屆在意大利舉行的冬奧會共有93個國家及地區參賽，超過3500名頂尖運動員匯聚於Milano Cortina競逐最高榮譽。中國香港隊今年是連續第七次派出隊員參加冬奧，今次將派出四位運動員參加短道速滑及高山滑雪項目，當中既有資深健將，也有首次參賽的新星。我衷心鼓勵各位運動員奮力拼搏，突破自我，勇敢追尋冬奧夢想。

特區政府一直以來持續投入資源，為運動員提供全面支援，助力大家專心訓練，爭取好成績。在二○二五至二六年度，政府透過精英運動員發展基金向香港體育學院撥款超過10億元，支持精英運動發展。中國香港運動員也不負眾望，佳績頻傳，令香港市民引以為傲。

今日大會授予中國香港代表隊這面區旗，承載着我們對運動員爭勝的渴望和夢想，也盛載廣大市民對你們的期望和祝福。我祝願中國香港代表團發揮出色，贏取佳績。謝謝大家。"

Over 120 participants from the local government, business and academic sectors attended the events.

  Themed ""Unleashing Trade Potential and Building Sustainable Economic Ties between Hong Kong and Brunei"", the seminar was co-organised with the Brunei Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and the Brunei Economic Development Board (BEDB). As an event under the Economic and Trade Express (ETE) initiative, the speakers illustrated to the audience Hong Kong's unique roles in the region, and how the ETE initiative would assist Hong Kong enterprises in expanding their regional reach, thus contributing to the diversification of the economy in Brunei. Other topics covered included how the Bruneian business sector could better utilise the ASEAN-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement, and how Hong Kong enterprises could collaborate with Brunei in the areas of fintech, the digital economy and agri-food technology, thus helping Hong Kong businesses explore opportunities in Brunei.

  In his welcome speech, the head of HKETO Kuala Lumpur, Mr Owin Fung, highlighted that bilateral trade in goods between Hong Kong and Brunei reached US$21 million in the first nine months of 2025, representing a robust 34 per cent year-on-year growth.

  Mr Fung added that Hong Kong is a ""super connector"" to the world, readily partnering with Bruneian businesses to ""go global"". Recently launched initiatives such as the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global and the ETE platform further strengthen Hong Kong as the premier springboard for Chinese Mainland enterprises expanding internationally, and empower Hong Kong small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups to unlock business opportunities in worldwide markets including Brunei.

Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 41, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (February 1) and seized about 20 380 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $91,700 and a duty potential of about $67,400, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

律政司司長在香港青年國際法律人才借調計劃暨第二屆香港青年國際法律人才帶路行活動宣介會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-02-02 12:25,2026-02-02 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200342.htm,"以下是律政司司長林定國資深大律師今日（二月二日）在香港青年國際法律人才借調計劃暨第二屆香港青年國際法律人才帶路行活動宣介會的致辭：

尊敬的張副特派員（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署（外交部駐港公署）副特派員張長偉）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好。歡迎大家在百忙之中抽空出席宣介會。今天是二月二日，在今天舉行宣介會格外有意義。數字「二」在中國文化中寓意成雙成對、同心協力，而今天的宣介會充分展現出兩個「二」的寓意。第一，宣介會由外交部駐港公署和律政司雙方共同合辦；第二，宣介會推廣兩個為香港青年法律人才而設的重要計劃，分別是每年的香港青年國際法律人才借調計劃和第二屆香港青年國際法律人才帶路行（「帶路行」）活動。公署和律政司攜手合作啓動這兩項計劃，定能相得益彰。

培育本地年輕的法律人才，尤其是在涉外法律事務方面， 一直是律政司一項重要的政策措施。二○二二年七月一日，習近平主席在香港回歸祖國25年發表重要講話，強調「青年興，則香港興；青年發展，則香港發展；青年有未來，則香港有未來」，指出香港要引領青年深刻認識國家發展方向和世界變化大勢，讓青年未來可以開拓未來、貢獻社會。習主席特別關愛香港的年輕人，在一封對香港中學生的回信中提出，希望香港青年學生把讀萬卷書與行萬里路結合起來，深刻認識世界發展大勢，深入了解祖國的歷史文化和現實國情。為此，安排香港青年赴國際組織工作和實地參訪「一帶一路」沿線國家和地區，是貫徹落實習主席重要指示的具體行動，為有志走向國際舞台的香港青年法律人才提供了發展平台和成長階梯。

香港青年國際法律人才借調計劃

在中央政府的大力支持下，香港特區政府與多個著名的國際機構，包括海牙國際私法會議、國際統一私法協會、聯合國國際貿易法委員會和亞洲基礎設施投資銀行達成合作安排，讓香港特區的年輕法律人員可以借調到這些國際機構工作。過去幾年，香港特區已推送多名青年法律人才親身赴國際法律組織任職，開拓他們的國際視野，使他們獲益良多。

隨着國際調解院的總部落戶香港，今年的借調計劃擴展到國際調解院。較早前，中央政府與國際調解院互致照會，並通過香港特區政府與國際調解院簽訂的諒解備忘錄達成借調香港法律專業人員往國際調解院的安排。通過借調到國際調解院工作，參加者可親身了解世界上首個專門以調解方式解決國際爭端的政府間國際法律組織的運作，掌握國際爭議解決的最新發展趨勢，並提升在跨境爭議解決、國際協商及法律協作方面的專業能力，進一步突顯香港作為國際法律及爭議解決中心的地位。

第二屆香港青年國際法律人才帶路行

除了香港青年國際法律人才借調計劃，也讓我介紹香港青年國際法律人才帶路行活動。去年首屆「帶路行」，有16位本地青年國際法律人才參訪了北京及新疆喀什兩個「一帶一路」倡議的重要城市。通過沉浸式的參訪和交流活動，參加者不單親身感受到國家在外交、涉外法治、創新科技及歷史文化等方面的最新發展，也深入了解國家推進「一帶一路」的宏大格局，探索「一帶一路」法律服務實踐和合作機遇。回顧首屆成果，參加者表示收穫豐富，對國家在國際法律事務中及香港在國家發展大局中的角色有了更深刻的體會。這些成果印證了「帶路行」的初衷，就是讓青年國際法律人才通過親身體驗，更好地認識國家、擁抱世界，從而在國際法律舞台上貢獻香港力量。

本屆「帶路行」的行程比去年更豐富，除了參訪作為「一帶一路」其中一個重要窗口的雲南地區，考察當地法治實踐、跨境司法合作及邊境治理經驗外，更會「走出去」，參訪老撾，了解中國老撾鐵路等「一帶一路」標誌性合作項目，讓香港青年法律人才親身體驗區域法律實務、多邊合作機制，以及中老合作的豐碩成果。

還記得去年我在「帶路行」的分享會曾說：「千里之行，始於足下」。今天的宣介會正是香港青年國際法律人才踏進國際舞台的重要第一步。借調計劃體現了國家對香港青年的深切關懷和厚望，同時彰顯「一國兩制」的獨特優勢。「帶路行」則為香港青年法律人才提供親身走進共建「一帶一路」國家和地區、了解當地法律制度、拓展國際視野的寶貴機會。兩項計劃都讓參加者以更宏觀的視角，思考法律在促進國際合作與全球發展中的關鍵角色。我衷心希望各位青年朋友把握機遇，積極報名參加這兩項計劃，勇敢踏出第一步，為國家和香港的未來發展作出貢獻。

最後，我代表律政司再次衷心感謝外交部的信任和支持。有賴雙方緊密的合作，我們得以為香港青年法律人才創造更多「走出去」的機遇。我在此鼓勵香港年輕的法律人才通過律政司網頁踴躍報名，並預祝今年的香港青年國際法律人才借調計劃和第二屆香港青年國際法律人才帶路行活動再次順利完成。

​農曆新年將至，我藉此機會祝願各位身體健康、馬到功成。謝謝。"

財經事務及庫務局副局長在立法會財經事務委員會會議就修訂《稅務條例》以實施加密資產申報框架和共同匯報標準的最新安排開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-02 12:22,2026-02-02 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200344.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）副局長陳浩濂今日（二月二日）在立法會財經事務委員會會議就修訂《稅務條例》以實施加密資產申報框架和共同匯報標準的最新安排的開場發言全文：

主席、各位委員：

香港一直支持國際間提升稅務透明度及打擊跨境逃稅的工作。二○一八年起，香港按經合組織（經濟合作及發展組織）制定的共同匯報標準，每年與夥伴稅務管轄區自動交換相關稅務居民的財務帳戶資料，以協助偵查及打擊跨境逃稅。

數碼資產市場近年急促發展，各國及地區需要填補潛在的跨境逃稅漏洞。經合組織於二○二三年公布加密資產申報框架，讓相關稅務管轄區每年自動交換相關交易資料，並將新數碼金融產品及優化的申報及盡職審查規定納入共同匯報標準。

二○二五年《施政報告》公布，政府將於今年向立法會提交立法建議，以期在二○二七年實施加密資產申報框架，規定加密資產服務提供者收集有關資料，以供稅務局由二○二八年起與夥伴稅務管轄區交換。政府亦計劃由二○二八年起實施新修訂的共同匯報標準。在無損加密資產申報框架有效實施的前提下，我們會採取措施便利申報加密資產服務提供者，包括設立加密資產申報框架平台、於稅務局網站發布指引及常見問題，以及由稅務局設立專責小組，為業界提供技術支援和解答查詢。

另一方面，經合組織自二○二四年起，就香港實施共同匯報標準的成效展開成員相互評估。經合組織認為香港應加強識辨申報財務機構，並優化罰則及執法。香港須於二○二六年中前作出回應，以期在成員相互評估中取得良好評級以維持香港作為國際金融和商業中心的聲譽，避免香港被評為「不合作稅務管轄區」而增加香港財務機構與其他稅務管轄區業務往來時的申報和合規負擔。

我們亦藉此機會就實施全球最低稅的相關《稅務條例》條文作技術性修訂，以納入經合組織的最新註釋文件。這項修訂不會影響相關措施的實施。

我們已就加密資產申報框架和共同匯報標準的立法建議展開公眾諮詢，諮詢期至本周五，即二月六日。根據初步收到的意見，持份者普遍理解及支持政府的建議。財庫局和稅務局亦於二○二六年一月中舉辦三場交流會，向稅務及法律專業人士、金融業界及加密資產業界等持份者介紹政府的建議及交換意見。今天希望聽取委員的意見，以期於今年上半年向立法會提交兩項條例草案。

現在請稅務局局長為委員簡介立法建議。多謝主席。"
財經事務及庫務局局長在立法會財經事務委員會會議就財經事務及庫務局財經事務科及香港警務處首長級職位建議開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-02 12:14,2026-02-02 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/02/P2026020200336.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（二月二日）在立法會財經事務委員會（財委會）會議就財經事務及庫務局財經事務科及香港警務處首長級職位的開場發言全文：

主席：

本文件向委員簡介兩項有關人事編制的建議。第一項，在財經事務及庫務局財經事務科開設兩個首長級有時限編外職位，負責籌辦二○二六年亞太經合組織（亞太區經濟合作組織）財長會議（財政部長會議）；以及第二項，將香港警務處財富情報及調查科的一個首長級有時限職位轉為常額職位，以維持政府在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。

首先，我向各位委員介紹有關籌辦二○二六年亞太經合組織財長會議的人事編制建議。

香港一直以來，積極參與亞太經合組織不同範疇的工作，包括有關財長會議的工作，以進一步提升香港的國際性，以及促進地區宏觀經濟和金融市場發展。中國作為二○二六年亞太經合組織的東道主，負責籌備及主持亞太經合組織領導人非正式會議、一系列部長級會議和其他會議。中央政府早前宣布，會以國家財政部主辦，特區（香港特別行政區）政府承辦的方式，於本年十月在香港舉行財長會議，特區政府對此深感榮幸，並會全力以赴辦好辦妥財長會議，彰顯香港在「一國兩制」下作為世界公認的國際金融中心的地位。

這是香港首次籌辦亞太經合組織財長會議。財長會議正好提供平台，讓組織成員的財政部長就地區以至全球經濟前景交換意見，同時亦可讓香港向各與會成員展示本地金融、經濟發展等方面的最新發展，促進相互經濟合作，有助鞏固和提升香港作為國際金融中心的地位。

今年十月的財長會議暫定為期三天。屆時，21個亞太經合組織成員的財政部長、高級財金官員，以及以觀察員身分參與的國際組織代表將來港出席會議。初步預計，屆時將會有大約500名訪客來港出席會議。特區政府需負責整個會議的籌辦工作，包括提供會議場地、酒店住宿、交通、禮遇及宣傳等。

籌辦如此重要的國際會議，需要周詳的前期計劃，以及專責人員的有效執行，故有必要成立由首長級人員領導的專責會議統籌小組，做好各方面的聯繫及籌備工作，確保會議順利舉行。

我們建議由一名首長級乙級政務官擔任主管，帶領在財經事務科內設立的會議統籌小組，並由一名高級首席行政主任擔任副主管，監督會議的整體籌備工作。因此需開設兩個首長級有時限職位，由財委會批准當日起至二○二六年十一月三十日止。

我們已審慎評估兩個擬設職位可否由財經事務科現有的同事兼任。然而，兩個擬設職位須在財長會議籌備和舉行期間，全職負責繁重的籌備工作。如調配現有同事兼任，必定會影響他們本身的政策及立法工作，並不可取。

至於第二項人事編制建議，是把警務處財富情報及調查科的一個首長級有時限職位轉為常額職位，以維持政府在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作。

警務處在二○二一年五月開設了一個總警司有時限職位，為期五年，負責掌管在二○二一年六月起投入運作的財富情報及調查科。自成立至今，在財富情報及調查科總警司的督導下，警務處推行了周詳的策略，讓香港在打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集方面的工作達到最高水平，得以符合財務行動特別組織的標準，並切合香港的國際金融中心地位。

儘管已取得不少成果，但與此同時洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集的犯罪形勢不斷在演變，例如科技進步導致洗錢不斷出現新手段、洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集活動持續數字化，及跨境罪案上升令調查工作更加複雜和敏感。

為應對以上挑戰，我們建議將此總警司有時限職位轉為常額職位，以領導財富情報及調查科繼續提升能力。事實上，立法會人事編制小組委員會於五年前審議此有時限職位時，已有議員提出把總警司職位設於常額編制。

我懇請委員支持這兩項建議。獲得委員支持後，我們會在三月中諮詢人事編制小組委員會，然後在四月徵求財委會的批准。

我們樂意回答議員的提問。多謝主席。"
