天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-09 06:46,2026-01-09 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900133.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月九日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-09 06:46,2026-01-09 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/09/P2026010900134.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 9) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

CEDD commended by Ombudsman on slope safety work,2026-01-08 23:22,2026-01-08 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800884.htm,"​Regarding the report on the direct investigation into the Government's work on landslide prevention and mitigation and management of government slopes released by the Office of the Ombudsman today (January 8), the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) welcomed the Office's high commendation and recognition of the department's efforts in implementing the Landslip Prevention and Mitigation Programme (LPMitP) and regulating slope safety. The CEDD accepts the Office's recommendations and will fully implement various initiatives while continuously reviewing their effectiveness. In response to the Office's recommendations, the CEDD will continue to strengthen its overall capability in responding to landslide risks in four areas, namely preparedness, early warning, emergency response and recovery, to keep enhancing slope safety.

On preparedness, applying a risk-based approach under the LPMitP, the CEDD systematically selects government man-made slopes for upgrading works and natural hillside catchments for mitigation measures annually. Starting from 2025, the CEDD has been progressively increasing the annual targets under the LPMitP and optimising the slope selection mechanism to strengthen resilience of slopes to heavy rain. The CEDD will review the LPMitP's targets and effectiveness in response to environmental changes, ensuring the LPMitP's continued efficacy.

The CEDD plans to fully roll out the Smart Slope Catalogue this year, integrating records of mitigation works, maintenance, rainfall endured, and landslides to expand comprehensive monitoring and data management related to slopes. By applying artificial intelligence for big data analysis, the catalogue will improve the functionality and efficiency of slope safety management, thereby better preparing for extreme weather.

On early warning, the CEDD will fully commission the AI Landslip Warning System in the wet season of this year. The system integrates Hong Kong's rainfall data and information in the Smart Slope Catalogue, and applies machine learning and big data analytics, to boost the accuracy of the predicted number of landslides during heavy rain, thereby enhancing the capability for landslide risk assessment and improving the reliability of the issuance of Landslip Warning.

On emergency response and recovery, the CEDD will stay abreast of the technological advancements in slope safety, and developing and introducing innovative technologies. This includes piloting applications of a smart unmanned drone management system on slope monitoring and emergency management to expand data collection and analytics capabilities. The CEDD will also continue to strengthen collaboration with relevant departments, such as sharing on common maintenance issues and assessment of the impact of heavy rain on slopes, with a view to enhancing slope safety and reducing landslide risk.

The Office noted that the landslide incident rate for government slopes is relatively higher and that there are cases of repeated occurrences. In fact, this is mainly related to the categorisation of slopes and their potential impact, reflecting the government's risk-based approach to slope management. The man-made slopes maintained by the government are distributed over an extensive area, possess diversified nature, and have different levels of risks. These include slopes with relatively high, medium, and relatively low potential impacts, categorised mainly by the risk of loss of life in the event of a landslide. To ensure public safety, the government will prioritise landslide prevention works on slopes that pose a higher potential impact. Some of the government slopes that fall into medium or relatively low potential impact categories may not be accorded priority because of their relatively remote locations or a lower risk of loss of life. As such, those government slopes with medium and relatively low potential impacts may also experience landslides under a risk-controlled condition. On the contrary, private man-made slopes are more similar in nature. Most of them are close to private residences and would pose greater impact on the residents in the event of a landslide. They are generally categorised as having relatively high potential impact and receive a higher level of attention. This explains why the overall landslide incident rate for government slopes appears higher, and why landslides may occur repeatedly on some individual slopes with medium or relatively low potential impacts.

In fact, between 2020 and 2024, the annual landslide incident rates for both government and private man-made slopes remained below one per cent (ranging from 0.1 per cent to 0.6 per cent for government slopes and 0.03 per cent to 0.3 per cent for private slopes), which is a very low level. Overall, an average of about 214 incidents were recorded annually over the past decade (2015 to 2024), representing a decrease of nearly one-third compared to the average of about 300 incidents between 1989 and 2014. This reflects the notable results achieved through the ongoing prevention and mitigation efforts.

In response to the landslide incidents triggered by the extreme rainstorm in September 2023, the CEDD has completed a systematic review and study, putting forward a number of recommendations to optimise the LPMitP. New measures include expediting the progress of LPMitP and prioritising, under a risk-based approach, the risk management of man-made slopes located along sole vehicular accesses and those with a greater potential impact on the public's daily lives. The CEDD thanks the Ombudsman for recognising in its report the department's timely review and adjustment of the direction of the LPMitP, acknowledging that such an approach is proactive and effective in adapting to changing circumstances.

The CEDD will continue to closely monitor slope safety in Hong Kong and remains committed to enhancing slope safety management through collaboration, driving Hong Kong's development as a resilient and livable world-class city."
Public healthcare fees and charges reform shows initial success Accident and Emergency Departments focus resources on critical care,2026-01-08 21:17,2026-01-08 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800783.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

​The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson announced today (January 8) that since the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform one week ago, operations in Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) of public hospitals have been functioning smoothly. The overall number of attendances has decreased. A&Es have been able to concentrate resources to serve critical and emergency patients, ensuring timely treatment for all critical and emergency patients and improving the efficiency of patient care.

During the past week (from January 1 to 7), a total of 32 147 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA. Among them, 1 807 patients were triaged as critical or emergency cases, 14 077 as urgent cases, while the remaining 16 263 as semi-urgent or non-urgent cases.

During this period, the daily average A&E attendances was 4 592, which included an average of 258 critical or urgent cases (5.6 per cent), 2 011 emergency cases (43.8 per cent), and 2 323 semi-urgent or non-urgent patients (50.6 per cent). Compared to the full year of 2025, the daily average A&E attendances was 5 210, comprising 228 critical or emergency cases (4.4 per cent), 2 156 emergency cases (41.4 per cent), and 2 826 semi-urgent or non-urgent cases (54.2 per cent).

The HA spokesperson said, ""Over the past week, the number of A&E attendances and the proportion of patients of various triage categories at A&Es indicate that the public healthcare fees and charges reform has yielded initial results. Not only have the number and proportion of semi-urgent and non-urgent patients decreased, but all critical and emergency patients arriving at A&Es have been able to receive immediate treatment from healthcare staff. The vast majority of emergency patients received treatment within 15 minutes of arrival. Additionally, the proportion of urgent patients receiving treatment within 30 minutes has increased from 82.7 per cent last year to 88.8 per cent, while the average waiting time for urgent patients has decreased from 22 minutes to 19 minutes.""

Following the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the HA has regularised the A&E refund arrangements, which can facilitate less urgent patients in opting to other healthcare institutions after triage. From January 1 to 7 this year, a total of 257 A&E patients applied for refund, compared to 691 patients during the same period in 2025. The spokesperson reiterated that A&E is positioned to serve critical, emergency and urgent patients. Individuals with minor conditions or episodic illnesses, such as common colds, are encouraged to visit Family Medicine Clinics, private doctors, or 24-hour outpatient services of private hospitals. This enables A&E to concentrate resources on treating patients with urgent medical needs.

Currently, all A&Es are operating smoothly. While a small number of semi-urgent and non-urgent patients might experience longer waiting time when A&Es were handling a large volume of critical cases at certain period, the majority of these patients were treated and discharged within a few hours. All patients requiring admission after treatment in A&E can be admitted within four hours, with no patient remaining in the A&E for extended periods awaiting admission.

The HA will continue to closely monitor the operations of A&E to ensure that resources are focused on patients with urgent medical needs, in line with the objectives of the public healthcare fees and charges reform to strengthen support for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients."

醫管局發言人說︰「在過去一星期，從急症室的就診人數及各分流類別病人的比例可以觀察到，公營醫療收費收革對急症室服務已產生初步成效。不但次緊急及非緊急病人的數量及所佔百分比有所減少，所有危殆病人在送抵危症室後，均可以即時由醫護人員搶救治療；絕大部分危急病人，亦可於抵達急症室的15分鐘內獲得治療。至於緊急病人在30分鐘內接受治療的比率，亦由去年的82.7%增加至88.8%，緊急病人的平均等候時間亦由22分鐘縮短至19分鐘。」

醫管局在公營醫療收費改革實施後，將急症室退款機制恆常化，亦有助非緊急病人在分流後選擇轉往其他醫療機構就診。今年一月一日至七日，共有257名急症室病人申請退款，而二○二五年同一時段，則有691名急症室病人申請退款。發言人重申，急症室的定位在於服務危殆、危急及緊急病人，病情較輕或患上偶發性疾病，例如普通傷風感冒，相關人士應該盡量前往家庭醫學診所、私家醫生或私家醫院24小時門診就診，讓急症室可以集中資源治療有緊急醫療需要的病人。

現時所有急症室的運作都暢順。由於部分急症室在個別時段需要處理大量需要搶救的病人，所以有少數次緊急或非緊急病人需要等候較長時間，但大部分次緊急或非緊急病人均可以在數小時內完成治療出院。至於經急症室治療後需要入院的病人，全部可以在四小時內獲安排入院留醫，沒有病人需要長時間滯留在急症室等候入院。

醫管局會繼續密切監察急症室的運作情況，會確保急症室集中資源照顧有緊急醫療需要的病人，以達致公營醫療收費改革中，加強保障貧、急、重、危病人的宗旨。"
土拓署規管斜坡安全工作獲申訴專員公署嘉許,2026-01-08 20:50,2026-01-08 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800773.htm,"就申訴專員公署今日（一月八日）發表「政府的防治山泥傾瀉工作及對政府斜坡的管理」的主動調查報告，土木工程拓展署（土拓署）欣悉公署對土拓署在推展「長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃」及規管斜坡安全的工作予以肯定和高度嘉許，並表示接納公署的建議，繼續全力推行各項政策措施，持續檢視執行成效。就公署的各項建議，土拓署會繼續在準備、預警、應急和復原四方面，持續強化整體應對山泥傾瀉風險的能力，提升斜坡安全。

在準備方面，土拓署的「長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃」會按風險為本原則，每年有系統地選取政府人造斜坡進行鞏固工程，以及選取天然山坡進行風險緩減工程。由二○二五年起，土拓署逐步增加每年處理斜坡的目標數量，持續優化選取機制，強化斜坡抵禦暴雨的能力。署方會持續檢視計劃的目標和成效，以切合環境變化，讓計劃有效推行。

另外，土拓署計劃於今年內全面推展「智慧斜坡記錄冊」，包括防治工程記錄、維修保養記錄、曾承受雨量記錄、山泥傾瀉記錄等，增強與斜坡相關的全面監測與數據管理，應用人工智能進行大數據分析，提升斜坡安全管理的功能和效率，為應對極端天氣作更好的準備。

在預警方面，土拓署將於今年雨季正式啓用「人工智能山泥傾瀉警告系統」。系統整合香港的降雨數據及「智慧斜坡記錄冊」內的資料，應用人工智能進行大數據分析，進一步提高暴雨下估算山泥傾瀉數目的準確性，從而提升山泥傾瀉風險評估的能力，令「山泥傾瀉警告」的發放更為可靠。

在應急和復原方面，土拓署會繼續密切留意有關斜坡安全的科技發展，持續研發及引入各類創新科技，包括透過智能化無人機管理系統，測試應用於斜坡監察及應急管理等工作，加強數據收集和分析能力。土拓署亦會繼續與各相關部門持續深化協作，例如分享常見的維修保養問題、評估暴雨對斜坡的影響，進一步提升斜坡安全及減低山泥傾瀉的工作。

公署指出政府斜坡的山泥傾瀉事故比率相對較高及有重複發生的情況。其實，這主要與斜坡的分類和構成潛在影響程度有關，並反映政府以風險為本的原則處理斜坡。政府負責的人造斜坡範圍很廣、性質多元、風險程度不一，當中包括構成較高、中度及較低潛在影響的斜坡，這些潛在影響級別主要是根據斜坡發生山泥傾瀉後可能造成的人命傷亡風險來劃分的。政府會優先對構成較高潛在影響的斜坡進行防治工程，以保障公眾安全。至於部分政府斜坡屬於構成中度或較低潛在影響的類別，因其位置較偏遠或人命傷亡風險較低，所以未必是優先處理對象，以至這些屬中度或較低潛在影響的政府斜坡可能在風險可控的情況下發生山泥傾瀉。相對而言，私人負責的人造斜坡性質較為單一，多位於私人民居附近，一旦發生山泥傾瀉，對居民影響較大，所以一般屬於構成較高潛在影響的斜坡，注視程度亦因而較大。這解釋了為何整體上政府斜坡的山泥傾瀉比率看似較高，或有個別屬中度及較低潛在影響的斜坡重複出現山泥傾瀉的情況。

事實上，在二○二○至二○二四年，無論是政府或私人人造斜坡，其年度山泥傾瀉事故比率均低於1%（政府斜坡介乎0.1%至0.6%，私人斜坡介乎0.03%至0.3%），屬於相當低的水平。整體而言，過去十年（二○一五至二○二四年）每年平均約錄得 214宗事故，較以往（一九八九至二○一四年）平均約300宗的水平下降近三分之一，反映持續的防治工作已取得顯著成效。

針對二○二三年九月極端暴雨引發的山泥傾瀉事故，土拓署已完成有系統的事故調查與研究，並就「長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃」提出多項優化建議。新措施包括加快計劃進度，並在風險為本的原則下，優先關注位於唯一行車通道旁、對市民日常生活可能構成較大潛在影響的人造斜坡的風險管理。土拓署感謝公署在報告中對署方及時檢視和調整「長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃」方向的肯定，認同處理上能達致因時制宜的果效，做法正面可取。

土拓署會繼續密切監察香港斜坡安全狀況，透過多方協作，致力進一步提升本港斜坡安全管理水平，推動香港成為具抗禦力和宜居的世界級城市。"

李慧琼當選第八屆立法會主席後會見傳媒的發言（只有中文）,2026-01-08 18:35,2026-01-08 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800677.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是李慧琼今日（一月八日）當選第八屆立法會主席後，於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言：

我十分榮幸當選為第八屆立法會主席，衷心感謝議員對我的信任和支持，同時，我亦對陳振英議員表達由衷的感謝和尊重。無論我們誰參選，都是本着服務香港、貢獻國家的初心。

今次立法會主席選舉非常激烈，我們雙方都以理性務實的態度，透過政綱理念爭取議員同事的支持，充分展現一場高質素的君子之爭。

而今早的特別論壇上，各位議員對我們兩位候選人提出許多很寶貴的意見，對我而言是一個極大的收穫。這些意見將幫助我在未來四年更好地履行主席的職責。

第八屆立法會是完善選舉制度、全面落實「愛國者治港」的第二屆立法會。在此，我特別感謝梁君彥前主席，他帶領上屆立法會擺脫內耗，並在推動經濟和改善民生方面取得亮麗成績。新一屆立法會同樣匯聚一班愛國愛港的有能之士，我相信我們全體議員必定會繼往開來，延續上屆立法會的高質素、高效議政，造福市民。

我和全體議員都非常明白，第八屆立法會沒有適應期，市民期望我們盡快投入工作，處理各項迫切而備受社會關注的問題，這是完全可以理解的。我知道許多議員甚至在宣誓就任之前，已經爭分奪秒開展工作。行政長官亦已表示，首次立法會大會將由政府當局提出議案，聚焦討論大埔火災的善後工作、推動重建復常的安排及制度改革。按照行政長官的指示，我亦將安排本屆立法會的首次會議於下星期三，即一月十四日舉行。

此外，其他重要工作還包括財政司司長將於下月向立法會發表新一份《財政預算案》。預算案除了就當前公共財政提出務實建議外，議員亦將為改善民生及香港長遠經濟發展提出寶貴建言，幫助香港更好地應對未來挑戰。

今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，也是香港發展的關鍵時刻。立法會必定全力協助特區政府，積極落實習近平主席的囑咐，主動對接國家「十五五」規劃，堅持完善行政主導，推動經濟高質量發展，深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設，助力香港更好地融入和服務國家發展大局。

香港正處於由治及興的關鍵轉折點，正如行政長官在宣誓儀式上所言，他對新一屆立法會寄予厚望。我們以「行政主導」的原則，與特區政府既保持良性制衡，亦追求高效合作。我們要牢記，議員不應只是評論者，而是建設者；不應只善於發現問題，更要勇於解決問題。

我們務實貢獻，以宏觀視野和大局擔當為己任，時刻以市民福祉、國家利益和香港社會整體發展為依歸，成為特區政府推動管治和改革路上的必然夥伴。

我將積極與行政當局以及不同板塊的議員多溝通、多協作、多對接，持續優化行政和立法機關的良性互動。而新一屆立法會生效的《立法會議員守則》，將進一步提升議會的效益和問責性，讓議員更好地為市民服務，達到以民為本的目標。

新一年，新角色。出任立法會主席，我深感責任重大。香港未來仍會面對很多挑戰，仍有許多棘手的問題需要處理。我深信「事雖難，做則必成」，只要我們全力以赴，一定能夠迎難而上。我將運用多年來在議會內外擔任不同角色崗位所累積的經驗，以公平公正、不偏不倚的態度處理各項事務；加上立法會秘書處專業團隊的支持，我相信我們必定能夠事半功倍。

「單絲不成線，獨木不成林」，九十位議員就是九十股守護香港的力量。我們與特區政府共同推動變革創新，促進香港長期繁榮穩定，貢獻國家所需。謝謝大家！"
Two incoming passengers convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2026-01-08 18:15,2026-01-08 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800603.htm,"  Two incoming passengers were sentenced to four months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,200, andthree months' imprisonment, respectively by the courts today (January 8) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

  Customs officers intercepted a 41-year-old incoming female passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on August 31, 2025, and seized 10 880 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $44,000 and a duty potential of about $35,000 from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested and was sentenced to four months' imprisonment with a fine of $1,200 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today.

  In addition, Customs officers intercepted a 39-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on January 6. About 8 080 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $36,000 and a duty potential of about $27,000 were seized from the inner pockets of his jacket and his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today.

  Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
兩名入境旅客進口未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2026-01-08 18:15,2026-01-08 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800602.htm,"兩名入境旅客因進口未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（一月八日）分別在法院被判處監禁四個月和罰款一千二百元，以及監禁三個月。

海關人員於二○二五年八月三十一日在落馬洲支線管制站截查一名四十一歲抵港女旅客，在她攜帶的個人行李內檢獲一萬零八百八十支未完稅香煙，估計市值約四萬四千元，應課稅值約三萬五千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。她今日在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁四個月和罰款一千二百元。

另外，海關人員於一月六日在香港國際機場截查一名三十九歲的抵港男旅客，並在他身穿的外套內袋及其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約八千零八十支未完稅香煙，估計市值約三萬六千元，應課稅值約二萬七千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日在西九龍裁判法院被判處監禁三個月。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映即使旅客屬初犯，亦可能被判處監禁。監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
DH urges public to stay vigilant as summer influenza season concludes while winter influenza season approaches,2026-01-08 17:51,2026-01-08 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800597.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 8) announced that the summer influenza season has concluded. Seasonal influenza activity has continued to decline in the past few weeks and dropped below the baseline levels during the most recent week. However, influenza activity may rise again as the weather gradually turns colder. With the winter influenza season approaching, the CHP strongly urged those who have not yet received the 2025/26 seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), particularly high-risk groups such as pregnant women, the elderly, children and those with chronic illnesses. These groups should receive their SIV promptly to reduce the risk of severe illness and death from infection.

Summer influenza season concludes and winter influenza season approaches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Hong Kong entered the summer influenza season in early September last year. Seasonal influenza activity peaked in mid-to-late October last year and has since been gradually declining. The latest surveillance data shows that the percentage of respiratory specimens tested positive for seasonal influenza viruses during the most recent week (December 28, 2025, to January 3, 2026) was 4.08 per cent, while the influenza admission rate in public hospitals was 0.23 cases per 10 000 population. As both indicators have dropped below the baseline levels (i.e. 4.94 per cent and 0.27 cases per 10 000 population respectively), the CHP confirmed that the summer influenza season has ended. Hong Kong entered the summer influenza season in September last year and it has lasted about four months. The summer influenza season started later than usual,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The predominant virus circulating during this seasonal influenza season was the influenza A (H3) virus strain. As in the past, severe or fatal cases associated with seasonal influenza primarily affect the elderly and children. This summer influenza season recorded 25 severe paediatric influenza cases, including three fatal cases. The affected children were aged between 6 months to 17 years old. Among them, 20 cases (80 per cent) had not received an SIV (including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only four days before onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, the case was not protected by the vaccine. Therefore, it is not counted as being vaccinated). During the same period, 507 severe influenza cases were recorded among adults, including 342 deaths. About 80 per cent of severe adult influenza cases involved elderly persons aged 65 or above while over 70 per cent of the patients did not receive an SIV.

""This summer influenza season has ended, meaning there was no overlap between the summer and winter influenza seasons. However, influenza activity may rise again as the weather gradually turns colder in the first quarter of this year and it cannot be ruled out that the circulating virus strains may change as the winter influenza season approaches. Therefore, I once again urge all individuals aged 6 months or older, except those with known contraindications, to act promptly if they have not yet received an SIV. This includes those who contracted influenza during the summer influenza season in order to guard against other circulating virus strains that may emerge during the upcoming winter influenza season. Furthermore, although there are some antigenic differences between the currently circulating influenza A (H3) virus strain and the virus strain contained in the vaccine, an SIV can still offer protection against the variant strain of subclade K, as well as the influenza A (H1) and influenza B strains included in the vaccine,"" Dr Tsui said.

""Influenza seasons started earlier than usual in multiple regions worldwide last year. Influenza activity in the United States remains at high level and continues to increase, with approximately 11 million persons infected, 120 000 hospitalisations, and 5 000 deaths recorded this season. Influenza activity is anticipated to continue for several more weeks. Meanwhile, influenza activity has recently begun to decline on the Chinese Mainland, in the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Japan,"" he added.

2025/26 SIV Programmes
------------------------------

Getting vaccinated against influenza is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection. With the concerted efforts of all sectors of the community (including the medical sector, schools, parents and residential care homes), as of January 4, over 1.91 million doses of influenza vaccine were administered under various SIV programmes in the year 2025/26, representing an increase of approximately 4.4 per cent compared with the same period in the previous influenza vaccination season. Regarding schools, vaccination rates among schoolchildren in different age groups are 2 to 10 percentage points higher compared to the same period last year.

""Although the influenza activity has declined to below the baseline level at the moment, sporadic outbreaks caused by influenza viruses are still possible in schools and residential care homes. For children who did not join the SIV School Outreach Programme, parents should promptly bring their children to private doctors enrolled in the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme to receive an SIV. Moreover, residents and staff of residential care homes for the elderly should get vaccinated promptly. In addition, the SIV coverage rate for children aged 6 months to under 2 years is only about 22 per cent. Although this represents an approximate 5 percentage point increase compared to the same period last year, it is still much lower than that of other age groups. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to allow their children to receive an SIV,"" Dr Tsui said.

The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years to receive the vaccine; as well as the District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission in the 18 districts, 75 Family Medicine Clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For the list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccination at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system.

Members of the public may refer to the CHP'sCOVID-19 & Flu Express,Seasonal Influenza Webpage,COVID-19 Vaccination Programme Webpage, andVaccination Schemes Webpage, for the latest information."

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-08 17:30,2026-01-08 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800579.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 8), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

The Expo runs until February 1 and is open to the public for free.

The ""Hong Kong Art Toys Expo"" reminisces on the legendary journey of Hong Kong's toy industry, from being an original equipment manufacturer to nurturing internationally renowned art toy artists. The Expo showcases the exquisite craftsmanship and innovation of Hong Kong designers, featuring 12 popular large-scale original intellectual property (IP) figures and over 100 collectibles from nearly 30 Hong Kong toy brands and original IPs, offering visitors a full experience of the unique charm of Hong Kong's art toy culture.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, remarked that Hong Kong creators have excelled globally in the art toys realm with their innovative designs and increasing influence in the IP market. They are the key representatives of Hong Kong's creative force. The Government has been fully committed to promoting the development of creative industries, continuously nurturing local talent and supporting expansion into the Chinese Mainland and overseas markets, fostering a conducive environment to facilitate the sustainable development of the industry.

The ""Hong Kong Art Toys Expo"" is the first event in the ""A Tribute to Art Toys of Hong Kong"" series, and will be immediately followed by the launch in late January of the Hong Kong Art Toys Chronicle website in which the section of ""Masters' Hall"" will feature the lives and creative journeys of original character designers.

InvestHK hosts Chinese Medicine Forum to drive global expansion of Chinese medicine (with photos),2026-01-08 17:00,2026-01-08 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010700499.htm,"  ​Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (January 8) hosted the Chinese Medicine Forum, bringing together leaders from government, academia and industry for comprehensive discussions on research translations, clinical practices and standards development. The forum showcased Hong Kong's strengths in driving Chinese medicine (CM) enterprises' global expansion, attracting the participation of over 150 industry stakeholders.

 With the launch of the Government's first Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint and the opening of Hong Kong's first Chinese medicine hospital, the industry's focus on modernisation and international development of CM continues to grow. InvestHK hosted the forum to spark discussions on CM and actively attract and support CM enterprises to develop in Hong Kong, through providing one-stop support services to assist companies' expansion to overseas markets, achieve international certifications, and establish regional headquarters.

 The Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, said, ""As highlighted in the 2025 Policy Address, the Government is committed to advancing the development of CM. Hong Kong's advantages lie in its ability to leverage the Chinese Mainland's robust CM capabilities while possessing internationalised systems and standards. With the advantages of 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong is committed to becoming the 'super platform' linking CM enterprises between the Chinese Mainland and the world. InvestHK will assist the industry in accessing global capital and markets, positioning Hong Kong as a springboard for CM to go global.""

 The Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint covers service enhancements, professional training, standards development, research translation and international co-operation, providing a systematic framework for high-quality development. The Commissioner for Chinese Medicine Development of the Health Bureau, Dr Vincent Chung, said, ""The Blueprint is Hong Kong's first comprehensive policy document in this area, offering a clear direction for the high-quality development of CM. The Government will work closely with the industry to build Hong Kong into a bridgehead for CM to go global.""

 As the flagship institution, The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong is actively driving clinical, research, and teaching initiatives. It is driving partnerships with international institutions to develop Hong Kong's integrated Chinese-Western medicine model into a global reference. The Hospital Chief Executive of The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong, Professor Bian Zhaoxiang, stated, ""Our hospital will fully support the Government in implementing the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint, taking on the role of both flagship and 'change driver'. By specialising in disciplines and strengthening treatment of specific diseases, we will gather top talent to provide personalised services. At the same time, we will enhance the 'Hong Kong model' of collaboration between Chinese and Western medicine, developing high-standard clinical and research prototypes to set industry benchmarks. We will make good use of Hong Kong's international gateway advantages, and have already established strategic partnerships with institutions such as Chinese medicine hospitals on the Chinese Mainland, TCM-Klinik Bad Kötzting in Germany and Western Sydney University in Australia. Together, we will promote training, applications, and the development of Chinese patent medicines, supporting the high-quality growth of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong, the Greater Bay Area, and internationally to bring it to the world.""

 Hong Kong will accelerate its contribution to the internationalisation of CM standards. The Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute combines local and national expertise and works with international specialists to set standards for Chinese medicinal materials, actively participating in the development of global technical platforms. The Assistant Director of Health (Chinese Medicine), Dr Edmund Fong, said, ""Hong Kong will continue to contribute to the international application of CM standards and testing technologies. The Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute under the Department of Health has already established internationally recognised reference standards for 357 Chinese materia medica, and will continue to strengthen exchanges and collaborations with testing institutions both locally and globally. To establish Hong Kong as a bridgehead for CM to go global, we will continue to actively participate in international herbal medicines platforms and, through our role as a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine, make greater contributions to the global development of CM.""

 The General Manager of the Guangzhou Pharmaceutical Baiyunshan Hong Kong Company Limited, Mr Bruce Chan, added, ""The Blueprint offers clear development pathways and new opportunities for internationalisation. Hong Kong's financial and innovation advantages make it a key platform for CM enterprises to expand globally. We look forward to deepening collaboration with local financial institutions, universities and research bodies to support the development of The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong and the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute.""

 The Chinese Medicine Forum featured two panel discussions focusing on ""Research and Clinical Practice in CM"" and ""Modernisation and Internationalisation of CM"", in which speakers explored how research outcomes can be translated into clinical applications, the role of CM in modern healthcare systems, and strategies for setting international standards and promoting global certifications. Industry representatives shared practical experiences in achieving international certifications such as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and discussed strategies for cultural exchanges, standard promotion, and dissemination of clinical model to global. Following the forum, participants visited The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong in Tseung Kwan O and toured the Northern Metropolis to explore opportunities presented by Hong Kong's development in CM."
投資推廣署舉辦中醫藥發展論壇　助力中醫藥國際化發展（附圖）,2026-01-08 17:00,2026-01-08 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010700498.htm,"投資推廣署（投資署）今日（一月八日）舉辦中醫藥發展論壇，匯聚來自政府、學術界及中藥業界領袖，圍繞科研轉化、臨床實踐及標準制定進行深入交流，展示香港在推動中醫藥企業走向國際的優勢，吸引逾150位業界持份者參與。
  
隨着政府公布首份《中醫藥發展藍圖》及香港首間中醫醫院正式啓用，業界對中醫藥現代化與國際發展的關注持續增加。投資署舉辦論壇，激發業界對中醫藥的討論，積極吸引和協助中醫藥企業在港發展，透過提供一站式支援服務，協助企業藉香港開拓海外市場、完成國際認證及建立地區總部。
  
投資署署長劉凱旋表示：「正如二○二五年《施政報告》所強調，政府會持續推動中醫藥發展。香港的優勢在於既能依託祖國雄厚的中醫藥實力，同時擁有國際化的制度和標準。憑藉『一國兩制』優勢，香港將致力成為中醫藥企業連通內地與世界的超級平台。投資署將繼續協助業界對接全球資本和市場，推動香港成為中醫藥走向世界的橋頭堡。」
  
《中醫藥發展藍圖》涵蓋服務提升、專業培訓、標準制定、科研轉化與國際合作，為中醫藥邁向高質量發展提供系統性框架。醫務衞生局中醫藥發展專員鍾志豪博士表示：「《中醫藥發展藍圖》是香港首份中醫藥系統性政策文件，為中醫藥邁向高質量發展提供明確方向。特區政府將持續與業界攜手，建設香港成為中醫及中藥走向世界的橋頭堡。」
  
香港中醫醫院作為旗艦機構，正積極發揮臨床、科研及教學的帶動作用。醫院與國際機構建立合作關係，將香港的中西醫協作模式發展成可供全球參考的範本。香港中醫醫院行政總監卞兆祥教授指：「本院將全力配合政府落實《中醫藥發展藍圖》，擔當旗艦與『轉化者』角色，以『分科做專、專病做強』匯聚精英，提供個人化服務；同時深化中西醫協作的『香港模式』，發展高標準的臨床與科研範本，樹立行業標杆。我們將善用香港國際窗口優勢，並已與多家內地中醫醫院、德國魁茨汀醫院和澳洲西悉尼大學等國際機構建立戰略合作，推動培訓、應用及中成藥開發，助力中醫藥在香港、大灣區及國際高質量發展，走向世界。」
  
在標準制定方面，香港持續為中藥國際化作出貢獻。政府中藥檢測中心結合本地和國家檢測機構的專業力量，與國際專家合作制定中藥材標準，並積極參與國際技術平台建設。衞生署助理署長（中醫藥）方浩澄醫生表示：「香港將繼續為中藥標準和檢測技術的國際應用作出貢獻。衞生署轄下政府中藥檢測中心已為357種中藥材制定國際認可的參考標準，並會持續加強與海內外檢測機構的交流合作。為建設香港成為中醫藥走向世界的橋頭堡，我們將繼續積極參與國際草藥平台，並透過作為世界衞生組織傳統醫藥合作中心的身分，為全球中醫藥發展作出更大貢獻。」
  
廣藥白雲山香港有限公司總經理陳志釗補充：「《中醫藥發展藍圖》為業界提供清晰發展方向，特別是在推動中醫藥國際化方面開創新機遇。香港憑藉金融與科創環境優勢，成為中藥企業拓展全球市場的重要平台。我們期待與本地金融機構、高校及科研機構深化合作，共同支持香港中醫醫院及政府中藥檢測中心的發展。」
  
中醫藥發展論壇設有兩場專題討論，分別聚焦中醫藥的科研與臨床實踐及中醫藥的現代化與國際化。講者深入探討中醫藥科研成果如何轉化為臨床應用、中醫藥在現代醫療體系中的定位，以及如何制定國際標準與推動全球認證。業界分享了在國際認證方面的實踐經驗，例如生產質量管理規範（GMP）和國際標準化組織（ISO）等，並探討了文化傳播、標準輸出以及臨床模式輸出的策略。論壇後與會代表參觀位於將軍澳的香港中醫醫院，以及前往北部都會區考察，實地了解香港在發展中醫藥所帶來的機遇。"

Green Minibus service to High Island Reservoir East Dam to be suspended on Sunday morning amid temporary traffic and transport arrangements for marathon in Sai Kung,2026-01-08 16:09,2026-01-08 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800546.htm,"  The Government today (January 8) reminded members of the public and visitors that the following temporary road closures will be implemented at Tai Mong Tsai Road and Sai Kung Man Yee Road this Sunday (January 11) to facilitate the holding of a marathon event at Pak Tam Chung and Sai Kung Man Yee Road, Sai Kung:

(1) The section of Tai Mong Tsai Road between Pak Tam Chung Physically Handicapped and Able-bodied Site and Sai Kung Man Yee Road will be intermittently closed from 7.25am to 7.35am and 7.55am to 8.05am; and

(2) The section of Sai Kung Man Yee Road from its junction with Tai Mong Tsai Road to a point about 8.3 kilometres south of the same junction will be temporarily closed from 7.30am to 1.30pm.

  As for public transport, during the closure of Sai Kung Man Yee Road, the service of New Territories Green Minibus (GMB) Route No. 9A (Pak Tam Chung - East Dam, High Island Reservoir) will be suspended from its first departure from Pak Tam Chung at 9.30am until 1.30pm, and taxi access will also be prohibited, until the reopening of the road.

  The Government spokesman urged visitors to heed the temporary traffic and transport arrangements and said that they may only access the East Dam on foot during the suspension of public transport services. Visitors should plan their journeys well in advance, pay attention to on-site instructions, and observe their safety. Departments concerned have maintained close liaison with the event organiser and have been steering the GMB operator for early preparations, so that vehicles can be deployed as soon as the road reopens to enhance services to meet passenger demand, in co-ordination with the Police's traffic control measures to ease passenger flow.

  Other temporary road and traffic control measures, including adjusting the extent of road closures and alteration or suspension of public transport services, may be implemented by the Police at short notice depending on the actual traffic conditions.

夏季流感季節完結　冬季流感季節即將到臨　衞生署提醒市民預防流感切勿鬆懈,2026-01-08 16:00,2026-01-08 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800467.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月八日）宣布，夏季流感季節已經完結。季節性流感活躍程度在過去數周持續下降，並於最近一周降至基線水平以下。但隨着天氣漸轉寒冷，流感活躍程度可能會再度上升，冬季流感季節即將到臨，故中心強烈呼籲仍未接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗的人士，特別是孕婦、長者、兒童及長期病患者等高危人士，應盡快接種，以減低因流感而出現併發症和死亡的風險。

夏季流感季節完結冬季流感季節即將到臨
———————————————————
中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港自去年九月初踏入夏季流感季節，季節性流感活躍程度於去年十月中下旬達到最高水平後開始輾轉回落。最新的監測數據顯示，最近一周（二○二五年十二月二十八日至二○二六年一月三日）的呼吸道樣本中季節性流感病毒陽性百分比為4.08%，同期公立醫院的流感相關入院率為每一萬人0.23宗，兩者皆降至低於基線水平（分別為4.94%和每一萬人0.27宗），中心確定夏季流感季節已經完結。本港於去年九月初宣布進入夏季流感季節，共持續了約四個月，夏季流感季節較過往遲開始。」

今次的季節性流感季節流行的主要病毒為甲型（H3）流感病毒。與季節性流感相關的嚴重或死亡個案和以往一樣，主要影響「一老一幼」。今個夏季流感季節錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。當中，20宗（80%）個案沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前四天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗。由於接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，所以該病例未能受到疫苗保護。因此，該個案被視為未接種疫苗）。同期共錄得507宗成人嚴重流感個案，當中包括342宗死亡個案。成人嚴重流感個案中約八成為65歲以上長者，當中超過七成沒有接種季節性流感疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生說：「這次夏季流感季節已經完結，意味夏季及冬季流感季節沒有出現疊加，但隨着天氣在今年首季逐漸寒冷，而流行病毒株亦不排除會發生改變，流感活躍程度可能會再度上升，冬季流感季節即將到臨。因此，我再次呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗，應從速行動，包括在夏季流感季節曾感染流感的人士，以預防未來的冬季流感季節可能出現其他流行病毒株。此外，雖然目前流行的甲型（H3）流感病毒與疫苗所含的病毒株存在一些抗原差異，但季節性流感疫苗仍能對亞分支K的變異病毒株，以及疫苗中包含的甲型（H1）及乙型流感病毒提供保護。」

他補充說︰「全球多個地區於去年提前出現流感季節。美國的流感活躍程度正處於高水平及繼續上升，當地本季已錄得約1100萬人受感染、12萬人住院，以及5000人死亡，預計其流感活躍程度還會持續數周。另一方面，中國內地、英國、韓國及日本等的流感活躍程度在近期均開始出現回落。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃
————————————————————
接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。在社會各界（包括醫療界、學校、家長、院舍等）的通力合作下，截至一月四日，二○二五／二六年度各項流感疫苗接種計劃共接種超過191萬劑疫苗，較上一流感疫苗接種季度同期增加約4.4%。學校方面，不同年齡組別學童的接種率較去年同期高約兩至十個百分點。

徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然流感活躍程度目前已回落至低於基線水平，但仍有機會出現由流感病毒引致的學校及院舍零星爆發。如果學童沒有參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，家長應盡快帶子女到參加疫苗資助計劃的私家醫生接種季節性流感疫苗。另外，安老院舍院友及員工亦應盡快接種疫苗。此外，六個月至未滿兩歲的幼兒的季節性流感疫苗接種率只有約22%，雖然較上一季度同期上升近五個百分點，但仍遠低於其他年齡組別的接種率。中心已經透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵家長讓子女接種季節性流感疫苗。」

政府已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有六個月至兩歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的75間家庭醫學診所和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

有關最新的資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞、流感網頁、新冠疫苗接種計劃網頁和疫苗接種計劃專頁。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on January 7 to noon today (January 8), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 187 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由一月七日中午截至今日（一月八日）中午，食安中心已對187個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

風雨連場的二○二五年,2026-01-08 15:30,2026-01-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800327.htm,"根據世界氣象組織的初步評估，二○二五年正邁向成為全球有記錄以來第二或第三暖的一年。年內北極及南極的海冰覆蓋範圍持續遠低於平均水平。其中，北極海冰覆蓋範圍的全年最高值是自有衛星記錄以來的最低。二○二五年極端天氣事件影響全球多處，包括東亞、歐洲及地中海東部的熱浪；西南亞及亞馬遜盆地的嚴重乾旱；南亞、尼日利亞西部、剛果民主共和國、南非東開普省及美國德克薩斯州由極端降雨引致的水浸；以及熱帶氣旋在菲律賓、中國、越南、泰國、緬甸、莫桑比克、馬達加斯加、加勒比地區、馬來西亞及印尼帶來的嚴重破壞及重大傷亡。高溫、乾燥及大風天氣亦加劇了肆虐歐洲、韓國及美國加州的山火。

二○二五年一月至十月，赤道太平洋中部及東部海面溫度接近正常，該區海面溫度於二○二五年十一月至十二月徘徊在低於正常及接近正常水平。

本港方面，由於全年12個月均較正常溫暖，包括平均氣溫破紀錄的十月，二○二五年為有記錄以來第六暖的一年，全年平均氣溫達24.3度，較一九九一至二○二○年正常值（註一）高0.8度。而全年平均最高氣溫27.1度及平均最低氣溫22.4度分別為自一八八四年有記錄以來其中一個第五高及其中一個第六高。二○二五年的酷熱天氣（註二）日數及熱夜（註三）數目分別為53天及54天，兩者皆是有記錄以來的第三多。而極端酷熱天氣（註四）日數為四天，是有記錄以來其中一個第五多。

天文台於一月二十七日錄得全年最低氣溫10.6度。全年寒冷天氣（註五）日數為六天，較一九九一至二○二○年正常值少9.2天。此外，這亦是自一九九九年寒冷天氣警告系統開始運作以來，首次年內十一月及十二月均沒有發出寒冷天氣警告。

雖然二○二五年上半年的累積雨量為有記錄以來第五低的444.4毫米，但由於七月至九月出現連場大雨，全年總雨量為2 558.7毫米，較一九九一至二○二○年正常值2 431.2毫米多約百分之五。雨量主要集中在七月至九月，其間雨量佔全年總雨量超過百分之八十。天文台曾發出16次紅色暴雨警告及五次黑色暴雨警告，兩者皆打破各自的全年紀錄。二○二五年的雷暴日數為37天，較一九九一至二○二○年正常值少約5.3天。

由於上半年及十一月的相對濕度遠較正常低，二○二五年平均相對濕度為百分之七十三，較正常值的百分之七十八低百分之五，是自一九四七年以來與一九六三年並列最低。二○二五年濕度較低主要原因是一月至四月及十一月華南的東北季候風較正常乾燥。此外，五月及六月副熱帶高壓脊較正常強，而且向西延伸幅度較大，抑制了本港降雨，導致這兩個月的天氣相對乾燥。

二○二五年共有35個熱帶氣旋影響西北太平洋及南海，較長期（一九六一年至二○二○年）平均的約30個多。全年有14個熱帶氣旋達到颱風或以上強度（註六），接近長期平均的約15個，當中有五個熱帶氣旋達到超強颱風強度（中心附近最高10分鐘持續風速達到每小時185公里或以上）。本港方面，年內有14個熱帶氣旋引致天文台需要發出熱帶氣旋警告信號，為長期年平均約六個的兩倍以上，是自一九四六年以來最多。受七月颱風韋帕及九月超強颱風樺加沙影響，年內天文台需要兩度發出十號颶風信號，平了一九六四年的紀錄。在九月強烈熱帶風暴塔巴影響本港期間，天文台曾發出八號烈風或暴風信號。

年內影響本港的熱帶氣旋數目破紀錄的主要原因是夏季及秋季西北太平洋海面溫度較正常高及副熱帶高壓脊向西延伸幅度較大，有利西北太平洋及南海的熱帶氣旋移向南海北部，提高了影響包括香港在內的華南沿岸的機會。

Over the Arctic and Antarctica, sea-ice extent remained well below average during the year. In particular, the Arctic annual maximum sea-ice extent was the lowest in the satellite record. Extreme weather events affected many parts of the world in 2025, including heatwaves in East Asia, Europe, and the eastern Mediterranean; severe droughts in southwest Asia and the Amazon basin; severe flooding triggered by extreme rainfall in South Asia, western Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Eastern Cape of South Africa, and Texas in the United States; and severe damages and heavy casualties inflicted by tropical cyclones in the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Mozambique, Madagascar, the Caribbean, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Rampant wildfires, exacerbated by high temperatures, dry and windy conditions, also wreaked havoc in Europe, the Republic of Korea, and California in the United States.

  Sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific were near normal from January through October 2025, then lingered between below normal and near normal in November and December 2025.

  In Hong Kong, with all 12 months warmer than usual, including the record-breaking monthly mean temperature in October, 2025 was the sixth warmest year on record, with the annual mean temperature reaching 24.3 degrees, 0.8 degrees above the 1991-2020 normal (Note 1). The annual mean maximum temperature of 27.1 degrees and the annual mean minimum temperature of 22.4 degrees were respectively one of the fifth highest and one of the sixth highest since records began in 1884. There were 53 very hot days (Note 2) and 54 hot nights (Note 3) in Hong Kong in 2025, both ranking the third highest on record. There were also four extremely hot days (Note 4), ranking one of the fifth highest on record.

  The lowest temperature recorded at the Observatory in the year was 10.6 degrees on January 27. The number of cold days (Note 5) in the year was six days, 9.2 days less than the 1991-2020 normal. Moreover, this was also the first time that no Cold Weather Warning was in force in November and December in a year since the Cold Weather Warning System commenced operation in 1999.

  While the accumulated rainfall recorded in the first half of the year was only 444.4 millimetres, the fifth lowest on record for the same period, with outbreaks of heavy rain during July to September, the annual total rainfall in 2025 was 2 558.7 millimetres, about 5 per cent above the 1991-2020 normal of 2 431.2 millimetres. The rainfall was concentrated during July to September, and the total rainfall during these three months contributed more than 80 per cent of the annual rainfall. There were 16 Red Rainstorm Warnings and five Black Rainstorm Warnings, breaking the respective highest annual numbers on record. The number of days with thunderstorms reported in Hong Kong was 37 days in 2025, 5.3 days less than the 1991-2020 normal.

  With the relative humidity well below normal in the first half of the year and in November, the annual mean relative humidity of 73 per cent in 2025 was 5 per cent below the normal of 78 per cent and on par with 1963 as one of the lowest on record since 1947. The low humidity in 2025 is mainly attributed to the drier-than-usual northeast monsoon over southern China from January to April and in November. The stronger-than-normal and more westward extending subtropical ridge in May and June, which suppressed the precipitation in Hong Kong, also contributed to the relatively drier weather in these two months.

  A total of 35 tropical cyclones occurred over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea in 2025, more than the long-term (1961-2020) average of about 30. There were 14 tropical cyclones reaching typhoon intensity (Note 6) or above during the year, similar to the long-term average of about 15, and five of them reached super typhoon intensity (with maximum 10-minute wind speed of 185 kilometres/h or above near the centre). In Hong Kong, 14 tropical cyclones necessitated the issuance of tropical cyclone warning signals, more than double the long-term average of about six in a year, the highest annual number since 1946. The Hurricane Signal No. 10 was issued twice in the year during the passages of Typhoon Wipha in July and Super Typhoon Ragasa in September, tying the previous record in 1964. The No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal was issued during the passage of Severe Tropical Storm Tapah in September. 

  The record-breaking number of tropical cyclones affecting Hong Kong in the year is mainly attributed to higher-than-normal sea surface temperature over the western North Pacific and the more westward extending subtropical ridge during the summer and autumn, which favoured the tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea moving towards the northern part of the South China Sea, increasing the chance that they would affect the coast of southern China, including Hong Kong.

一月二十五日起實施強制安裝和佩戴安全帶及駕駛時放置流動電訊裝置新規定（附圖／短片）,2026-01-08 13:11,2026-01-08 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800199.htm,"政府今日（一月八日）提醒市民，由一月二十五日起，所有公共交通工具和商用車座位乘客均須佩戴安全帶；此外，任何司機在駕駛時均不可在前方放置多於兩部流動電訊裝置，進一步加強道路、乘車和駕駛安全。

由一月二十五日起，所有新登記的公共及私家巴士的所有乘客座位，私家小巴和貨車的後排乘客座位，以及特別用途車輛的司機和所有乘客座位，均須安裝安全帶。乘坐這些車輛時，如座位已安裝安全帶，不論車輛是否新登記，司機和座位乘客均須佩戴。研究顯示，佩戴安全帶可減低司機和乘客在迎頭相撞意外中死亡和重傷的風險分別約四成和七成。

違例車主、司機或乘客最高可處罰款5,000元及監禁三個月。所有乘客須為佩戴安全帶自行負責。其中，15歲以下乘客如在貨車後座或特別用途車輛乘客座位未佩戴安全帶但司機仍駕駛車輛，司機最高可處罰款2,000元。

政府欣悉運輸業界已為新規定準備就緒。其中，所有新購專營巴士的座位已配備安全帶，連同營辦商在政府資助下為現役雙層巴士上層座位加裝安全帶，至今約有3500輛巴士配備有安全帶，佔全港巴士約六成。

此外，由同日起，任何司機駕駛時不可在前方放置多於兩部流動電訊裝置，即流動電話、平板或手提電腦，而每部裝置的屏幕對角不可超過19厘米長。裝置不能阻礙司機目視道路及交通情況，以及對觀察路況用的鏡、裝置或攝像顯示器的視線。違例者最高可處罰款2,000元。

政府自去年十一月起加強宣傳及公眾教育。運輸署與警方、教育局、政府新聞處、道路安全議會、運輸業界包括公共運輸服務營辦商等加強協作，透過網頁、短片、傳媒、社交媒體、家長電子專遞、各區交通燈控制器宣傳畫貼等介紹法例要求。專營巴士營辦商亦已在車廂和巴士站加強宣傳和廣播，提醒乘客注意佩戴安全帶的新規定。

New requirements for mandatory fitting and wearing of seat belts and placing of mobile telecommunications devices while driving to be implemented from January 25 (with photos/videos),2026-01-08 13:11,2026-01-08 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800216.htm,"  The Government today (January 8) reminded members of the public that, starting from January 25, all public transport and commercial vehicles' seated passengers must wear seat belts, and all drivers must not place more than two mobile telecommunications devices (MTDs) in front of them during driving, further enhancing road, passenger and driving safety.

  All passenger's seats in public and private buses, rear passenger's seats in private light buses and goods vehicles (GVs), and driver's seats and all passenger's seats of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) must be equipped with seat belts in these vehicles first registered on or after January 25. Drivers and passengers occupying the seats of these vehicles (whether newly registered or not), where seat belts are fitted, are required to wear them. Studies show that wearing seat belts will reduce the risk of death and serious injury of drivers and passengers in head-on collisions by about 40 per cent and 70 per cent respectively.

  Offending vehicle owners, drivers or passengers will be liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to three months. All passengers occupying seats shall be responsible for wearing seat belts. Among them, any driver who still drives with a passenger aged under 15 seated in the rear seat of a GV or the passenger's seat of an SPV without wearing a seat belt will be subject to a maximum fine of $2,000.

  The Government noted that the transport trades are ready for the new requirements. In franchised buses, all seats in newly procured buses have been equipped with seat belts. Together with existing double-deck buses retrofitted with seat belts on the upper-deck seats by operators under government subsidy, to date, around 3500 buses are now equipped with seat belts, representing about 60 per cent of the entire fleet in Hong Kong.

  In addition, from the same day onwards, any driver must not place more than two MTDs (i.e. mobile phones, tablet computers or laptop computers) in front of them during driving. The diagonal length of each screen must not exceed 19 centimetres. The MTDs must not obstruct the driver's view of the road and traffic, as well as any mirror, device or camera-monitor fitted for viewing the roads. Offenders will be liable to a maximum fine of $2,000.

  The Government has stepped up publicity and public education since November 2025. The Transport Department (TD) has strengthened collaboration with the Police, the Education Bureau, the Information Services Department, the Road Safety Council and the transport trades including public transport operators to introduce the legal requirements through websites, videos, media, social media, the ""e-Bulletin for Parents"" and publicity posters on traffic signal controllers across various districts. Franchised bus operators have also strengthened publicity and broadcast inside compartments and at bus stops to alert passengers to the new requirement of wearing seat belts.

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's webpage on the new requirements on seat belts (www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/sb) and placing MTDs during driving (www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/mtd) or the Agent T Facebook page (www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk), or call the hotline 28042600 for details."

早晨！很高興來到香港耀能協會這個以「愛聚‧共融」為主題的慈善藝術展啓動禮。剛踏入二○二六年，首先祝願各位新年進步、健康平安、所願皆成！

今日的展覽展出百多件包括繪畫、陶瓷及手織布藝等藝術作品，每件都承載着展能藝術家的才智與心血，獨一無二，展現了他們的想像力、創造力和克服障礙的堅毅精神。藝術無疆界，它超越傷健，觸動人心，是推動社會多元共融的重要一環。

多年來政府持續投入資源，加強康復服務，以今個財政年度為例，康復服務的預算開支達126億元。但除了資金以外，協助殘疾人士發展所長，讓社會更充分欣賞他們的潛能，也非常重要，這也有助他們更好融入社會。

去年七月，社會福利署便分階段將庇護工場轉型為綜合職業康復服務中心，優化其服務和訓練模式，讓殘疾人士按其興趣、才華及能力接受切合市場需要的技能訓練，預計將惠及約一萬人。我們會持續檢視和優化這些政策和措施，讓服務更貼合殘疾人士和社會的需要。

香港耀能協會植根香港超過60年，自一九六三年成立以來一直致力為不同年齡和殘障的人士提供多元化的康復服務，協助他們發揮潛能和融入社會。我知道協會有84個服務單位和專項計劃，每年服務約29 000個家庭。協會的八間綜合職業康復服務中心，支持殘疾人士通過進階培訓提升技能，並致力透過不同的活動，幫助他們展現才華。

在此，我衷心感謝香港耀能協會的團隊和所有合作夥伴以及義工們的貢獻和努力，同時向每一位參展的展能藝術家致意。我們會和大家一起繼續努力，共同建設一個共融美好的社會！

最後，預祝藝術展圓滿成功，也再次祝願大家愉快健康。多謝大家！"

Government posts notices for creation of rights of temporary occupation of land for construction of Northern Link Main Line,2026-01-08 12:08,2026-01-08 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010800184.htm,"  The Lands Department today (January 8) posted notices for the creation of rights of temporary occupation of land in accordance with section 21 of the Railways Ordinance (Chapter 519) for the construction of the Northern Link (NOL) Main Line.

Three private lots will be temporarily occupied until January 11, 2030, starting from the expiry of a three-month period from the date of affixing the notices (i.e. April 9, 2026). The Government will closely liaise with the relevant land owners and affected parties, and properly handle their compensation matters.

The Government executed the Part 1 Project Agreement of the NOL Project (comprising both the NOL Main Line and the NOL Spur Line) with the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) in July 2025 to commence works on the NOL Main Line that are more ready and time-critical. The Government also required the MTRCL to carry out the detailed planning and design of the NOL Spur Line including relevant statutory procedures in parallel. The NOL Main Line will become the public transportation backbone for multiple new development areas in the Northern Metropolis and connect the existing Tuen Ma Line and East Rail Line, forming a railway loop linking the New Territories and the Kowloon urban area. This will substantially enhance the coverage and resilience of the railway network and also unleash the development potential of the Northern Metropolis.The NOL Spur Line, as a cross-boundary bifurcation of the NOL Project, would connect the metro networks of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, offering both local commuting functions within Hong Kong as well as cross-boundary railway services."
Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into Government's work on landslide prevention and mitigation and management of government slopes (with photos),2026-01-08 11:00,2026-01-08 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010700691.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (January 8) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the work of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on landslide prevention and mitigation as well as management of government slopes, with 32 major recommendations for improvements made to the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD), the Lands Department (LandsD), the Highways Department (HyD), the Water Supplies Department (WSD) and the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD).

  On November 14, 2024, the Office of The Ombudsman (the Office) announced the launch of a direct investigation operation into the Government's monitoring and regulation of slope safety. Given the extent and complexity of the topic, the Office decided to initiate two direct investigation operations under a series approach to focus on the different aspects involved more effectively. While the first direct investigation operation announced by the Office today examines in detail the Government's landslide prevention and mitigation work, and its management of government man-made slopes, the second operation to be completed and announced later will focus on the authorities' determination of slope maintenance responsibility and risk management of private man-made slopes.

  Mr Chan said, ""Hong Kong is densely populated and characterised by its hilly terrain and scarcity of land. Coupled with the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, the risk of severe landslides is indeed a significant hazard, posing potential threats to the public's daily activities, lives and property.

  ""Since the establishment of the Geotechnical Engineering Office in 1977, the CEDD has endeavoured to enhance slope resilience against severe weather through a comprehensive slope safety system. The landslide risk in Hong Kong has been substantially lowered compared with the early years. This is an achievement as a result of the CEDD's immense efforts over the past decades. The Office highly commends the CEDD's work. We are also pleased to note that the current-term Government has introduced multiple forward-looking measures to continuously strengthen the overall capacity in coping with extreme weather through four key strategies, namely advance preparedness, enhanced early warning, decisive emergency response and speedy recovery. Meanwhile, the current-term Government vigorously applies innovative technologies, including the development of a Smart Slope Catalogue, to ensure that landslide prevention and mitigation work keep pace with the times.

  ""As global climate change intensifies, slope safety in Hong Kong will face new challenges and risks. The CEDD should continuously keep up with an innovative spirit and strive for excellence, in order to safeguard the monitoring and regulation of slope safety. As regards the four departments with maintenance responsibility for the majority of government man-made slopes (namely the LandsD, the HyD, the WSD and the ArchSD), we consider these departments to have carried out slope maintenance and repairs in accordance with their respective purview and the technical guide issued by the CEDD, and have arranged emergency inspections and repairs after landslide incidents. Nevertheless, we still find room for improvement on the part of all departments concerned in the safety management of natural hillside catchments and government man-made slopes, as well as interdepartmental collaboration.""

  Around 60 per cent of Hong Kong's land area is covered by natural hillsides. There are also a vast number of man-made slopes. As of December 2024, there were around 61 000 registered man-made slopes across Hong Kong, comprising around 38 600 government man-made slopes, 15 800 private man-made slopes and 6 300 man-made slopes with mixed maintenance responsibility. During the investigation, investigators of the Office examined a large volume of data (including Hong Kong's landslide data from more than 35 years since 1989, and data on relevant works and studies undertaken by the CEDD since 2010 under the Landslip Prevention and Mitigation Programme), as well as more than 50 landslide incidents involving natural hillside catchments or government man-made slopes. In addition to scrutinising documents, investigators also shadowed departmental staff in conducting seven site visits to acquire a comprehensive understanding on the CEDD's work on landslide prevention and mitigation, and slope maintenance audits, as well as how various maintenance departments carry out maintenance inspections to government man-made slopes under their purview.

  Over the past decade (2015 to 2024), an annual average of around 214 landslides was recorded in Hong Kong, nearly one-third below the annual average of around 300 landslides between 1989 and 2014. While natural hillside catchments generally do not require regular inspections or maintenance, the CEDD identifies those with higher potential risks for inclusion in the Programme to carry out risk mitigation works. Between 2015 and 2024, nearly 25 per cent of landslides involved natural hillside catchments. Upon review of nine serious landslides that occurred since 2008, the Office found that most involved natural hillside catchments. A majority of them had not been included in the Programme before the incidents, or even if they had already been so included, they were accorded a relatively low priority such that the actual study and design of the works had yet to commence by a consultancy contract of the programme before the incidents.

  As for government man-made slopes, among the landslides that occurred between 2015 and 2024, more than 40 per cent involved government man-made slopes and around 5 per cent involved private man-made slopes. As there are far more government man-made slopes than private ones, the higher number of incidents involving government man-made slopes is understandable. However, discounting the actual difference in the number of incidents involving the two kinds of slopes, the Office found that the failure rate (Note 1) of government man-made slopes (annual rate from 0.1 to 0.6 per cent) was still higher than that of private man-made slopes (annual rate from 0.03 to 0.3 per cent) by one to three times between 2020 and 2024. Undeniably, the failure rates of both government and private man-made slopes remained at a very low level of less than 1 per cent each year. In addition, the consequence-to-life category (Note 2) of nearly 80 per cent of the government man-made slopes with landslides was either the lower category 2 or 3. Nevertheless, the Office considers that the higher failure rate of government man-made slopes compared to private ones still warrants the Government's continuous attention.

  Furthermore, having reviewed those relatively more serious landslides involving government man-made slopes since 2014, the Office found that some of the slopes recorded repeated landslides within three years since the first incident, and that a particular slope even recorded four landslides at different parts within five years. Although the consequence-to-life category of all these government slopes with repeated landslides was not the highest category 1, and not every incident was large in scale, the recurrence of incidents inevitably raises concerns about the potential risks and structural safety of these slopes.

  Mr Chan said, ""The Office is pleased to learn that during our investigation, the CEDD proactively proposed improvement measures, including increasing the annual targets of the Programme progressively within three years from 2025, with the number of natural hillside catchments for risk mitigation works increased from 30 to 40 and that of government man-made slopes for upgrading works increased from 150 to 200. The CEDD has also identified three natural hillside catchments with similar geological conditions as Yiu Hing Road, Shau Kei Wan and included them in the Programme for assessment and risk mitigation works. In addition, the department will prioritise man-made slopes with greater potential impact on people's livelihood, especially those adjacent to the sole vehicular access, and systematically include them in the Programme for upgrading works.

  ""Summing up our findings, we recommend that the CEDD adopt measures to further enhance slope safety management. Meanwhile, all relevant departments should continue to deepen collaboration, foster exchanges of views and sharing of experiences so that their landslide prevention and mitigation work can be carried out more precisely and effectively. Finally, although the current landslide risk is substantially lower than decades ago, the authorities must remain vigilant in the face of slope degradation and the threat of extreme rainfall, and be well prepared for tough times. Landslide prevention and mitigation works are crucial for slope safety, yet call for the public's understanding for the inconvenience inevitably caused during the works period. I appeal to members of the public to support the Government's landslide prevention and mitigation work and work together to safeguard public safety.""

  Overall, the Office has made 32 recommendations to the CEDD, the LandsD, the HyD, the WSD and the ArchSD regarding the implementation of the Programme, safety management of natural hillside catchments and government man-made slopes, application of technologies and interdepartmental collaboration. The Office is pleased to note that the departments above have accepted all the recommendations.

  The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the departments include:


The CEDD should actively explore the feasibility of expediting risk mitigation works for the three natural hillside catchments already included in the Programme which have similar geological conditions as Yiu Hing Road, Shau Kei Wan;
The CEDD should continue with its regular review on any room to optimise the current selection criteria of natural hillside catchments for inclusion in the Programme, so that those with potential risks can be identified earlier;
The CEDD should continue to take note of any considerable differences in the failure rates between government and private man-made slopes, examine the underlying causes and formulate proper counter-measures where necessary;
If its examination reveals any areas for improvement in the maintenance of government man-made slopes on the part of the maintenance departments, the CEDD should continue to issue technical guidelines for their compliance;
The CEDD should continue with its regular review on any room to optimise the current selection criteria of government man-made slopes for inclusion in the Programme for upgrading works (for example, allowing more flexibility in prioritising slopes with repeated landslides under the programme according to actual circumstances);
The CEDD should continue to enhance the management of landslide prevention and mitigation works and slope maintenance audits as well as the planning of post-landslide response actions through the gradual increase of slope monitoring and management data, coupled with AI and big-data analytics;
The CEDD should explore expanding the scope of slope maintenance audits to include post-incident investigations and response actions involving government man-made slopes, with a view to reviewing the performance of maintenance departments from multiple perspectives and identifying possible areas for improvement, thereby learning from experience and nipping landslide risks in the bud; and
All relevant departments (including the LandsD, the HyD, the WSD and the ArchSD) may make use of the Centralised Slope Maintenance Database being developed by the CEDD and the Smart Slope Catalogue for data analytics to monitor the latest situations of slope maintenance, share common maintenance issues, and assess the impact of heavy rainfall on slopes. This should facilitate their planning of routine maintenance inspections and special inspections after adverse weather events, leading to higher efficiency.

申訴專員公署公布就政府防治山泥傾瀉工作及對政府斜坡管理的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2026-01-08 11:00,2026-01-08 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/08/P2026010700680.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（一月八日）宣布申訴專員公署完成就香港特別行政區政府的防治山泥傾瀉工作及對政府斜坡的管理的主動調查行動，並向土木工程拓展署（土拓署）、地政總署、路政署、水務署及建築署提出合共32項主要改善建議。

公署於二○二四年十一月十四日宣布就政府對斜坡安全的監察及規管進行主動調查行動。考慮到課題的廣泛性及複雜性，並為更有效聚焦課題所涵蓋的不同範疇，公署決定以系列形式，分別進行兩項主動調查行動。公署今日宣布已完成的首項主動調查行動，深入剖析政府的防治山泥傾瀉工作及對政府人造斜坡的管理；而將於稍後公布結果的第二項主動調查行動，則會集中審研當局對斜坡維修責任的鑑辨及對私人人造斜坡的風險管理工作。

陳積志表示：「香港山多平地少，且人口稠密，加上近年出現極端天氣愈趨頻密，嚴重山泥傾瀉的風險確是重大隱患，對市民的日常生活，以至生命財產，都可能構成威脅。」

「土拓署自一九七七年成立土力工程處以來，透過全方位的斜坡安全系統，致力強化斜坡抵禦惡劣天氣的能力。現時本港斜坡的山泥傾瀉風險已較早年大幅降低。這是土拓署過去數十年巨大努力所得的成果，公署對該署的工作予以高度嘉許。公署亦欣悉，現屆政府積極制訂多項前瞻性措施，透過超前準備、加強預警、果斷應急和迅速復原這四大應對策略，持續強化整體應對極端天氣的能力；同時大力應用創新科技，包括開發『智慧斜坡記錄冊』，令防治山泥傾瀉的工作與時並進。」

「全球氣候變化正日漸加劇，本港在斜坡安全方面將要面對新的挑戰及危機，土拓署需繼續抱持推陳出新及精益求精的精神，為斜坡安全監察及規管工作更努力把好關。對於四個負責維修最多政府斜坡的部門（包括地政總署、路政署、水務署及建築署），公署認為這些部門已按其職能及土拓署發出的技術指南，維修及保養轄下政府斜坡；亦有在山泥傾瀉事故發生後，安排緊急視察及維修。雖然如此，公署認為各部門在針對天然山坡及政府人造斜坡的安全管理，以至跨部門協作方面，仍有進一步提升的空間。」

全港約六成土地面積由天然山坡覆蓋，另有大量人造斜坡。截至二○二四年十二月，全港有約61 000個已登記的人造斜坡，政府人造斜坡佔38 600多個，私人人造斜坡則有15 800多個，另有6 300多個混合責任人造斜坡。在調查期間，公署的調查人員審視了大量數據（包括本港自一九八九年起超過35年的山泥傾瀉事故數據、土拓署自二○一○年起開展長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃的相關工程及研究數據等），以及超過50宗涉及天然山坡或政府人造斜坡的山泥傾瀉事故。除詳細審閱文件外，調查人員亦隨同部門人員進行了七次實地視察，深入了解土拓署防治山泥傾瀉及進行斜坡維修審核的工作，以及各斜坡維修部門如何為轄下政府人造斜坡進行維修檢查。

本港近十年（二○一五至二○二四年）每年錄得平均約214宗山泥傾瀉事故，較一九八九至二○一四年的每年平均約300宗，下跌接近三分之一。就天然山坡而言，這類斜坡一般無需定期檢查及維修，土拓署透過長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃，篩選構成較大潛在山泥傾瀉風險的天然山坡，進行風險緩減工程。在二○一五至二○二四年發生的山泥傾瀉事故中，有接近兩成半涉及天然山坡。公署審視自二○○八年起發生的九宗嚴重山泥傾瀉事故，發現多數涉及天然山坡，而且大部分在事故發生前未被納入長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃，或即使已被納入該計劃，但所處的優次較低而在事故前未被納入計劃的顧問合約，以展開實際的工程研究及設計。

至於政府人造斜坡，在二○一五至二○二四年發生的山泥傾瀉事故中，超過四成涉及政府人造斜坡，涉及私人人造斜坡的則約為5%。政府人造斜坡的數量顯著高於私人人造斜坡，因此涉及政府人造斜坡的事故數字較高，屬可以理解。然而，撇除兩類人造斜坡的實際事故數目差異後，公署發現，在二○二○至二○二四年，政府人造斜坡發生山泥傾瀉事故的比率（註1）（按年介乎0.1%至0.6%）仍高於私人人造斜坡（按年介乎0.03%至0.3%），相差介乎一至三倍不等。無可否認，不論政府人造斜坡，還是私人人造斜坡，按年發生山泥傾瀉事故的比率均低於1%，屬甚低水平，而接近八成發生於政府人造斜坡的山泥傾瀉事故，所涉及的均是「人命後果類別」級別（註2）較低的第二和第三級。雖然如此，公署認為對於政府人造斜坡發生事故的比率高於私人人造斜坡的情況，仍是值得當局持續關注。

此外，公署審視了自二○一四年起多宗涉及政府人造斜坡的較嚴重山泥傾瀉事故個案，發現部分斜坡在首次發生事故起計的三年內，便重複發生事故，個別斜坡更曾在五年內，於斜坡的不同部分發生四次事故。雖然該些重複發生山泥傾瀉事故的政府人造斜坡均不屬「人命後果類別」級別最高的第一級，亦不一定每次山泥傾瀉都屬大型事故，但在接連出現事故的情況下，難免會令人對該些斜坡的潛在事故風險，以至結構安全產生疑慮。

陳積志表示：「公署欣悉在調查期間，土拓署主動提出改善措施，包括由二○二五年起的三年內，逐步增加長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃的年度目標，每年進行風險緩減工程的天然山坡會由30個增加至40個；鞏固政府人造斜坡的年度目標，則由150個增加至200個。土拓署亦已識別了三個與筲箕灣耀興道的地質狀況相似的天然山坡，納入計劃進行評估及風險緩減工程。該署亦會重點審視對市民生活有較大潛在影響的人造斜坡，特別是位於唯一行車通道旁的斜坡，有系統地納入計劃進行鞏固工程。」

「綜合上述調查所得，公署認為，土拓署應採取措施進一步提升斜坡的安全管理。同時，各部門應持續深化協作，促進意見交流及經驗分享，令防治山泥傾瀉工作做得更加精準到位。最後，雖然現時的山泥傾瀉風險比數十年前大幅降低，但面對斜坡老化及極端暴雨的威脅，當局絕對不能鬆懈，必須居安思危。防治山泥傾瀉工程對確保斜坡安全十分關鍵，工程進行期間難免會為市民帶來不便，需要市民諒解。我期望市民支持政府的防治山泥傾瀉工作，合力保障公眾安全。」

整體而言，公署就長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃的執行、對天然山坡及政府人造斜坡的安全管理、科技應用，以及跨部門協作，向土拓署、地政總署、路政署、水務署及建築署提出共32項主要改善建議。公署欣悉，上述部門均接納公署提出的所有改善建議。

公署向各個部門提出的主要改善建議包括：


土拓署應積極研究加快為三個已納入長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃、與筲箕灣耀興道的地質狀況相似的天然山坡，開展風險緩減工程的可行性；
土拓署應繼續定期審視現行揀選天然山坡納入長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃的考慮因素有否進一步優化的空間，讓當局能及早識別具潛在風險的天然山坡；
土拓署應繼續關注和審視政府人造斜坡與私人人造斜坡在發生事故的比率是否出現重大差異，並了解箇中原因，以及在有需要時制訂合適的應對措施；
若土拓署審視後發現部門對政府人造斜坡的維修保養工作有進一步提升的地方，則應繼續以技術指引的方式訂明，讓負責維修斜坡的部門有所依循；
土拓署應繼續定期檢視現時就揀選政府人造斜坡納入長遠防治山泥傾瀉計劃進行鞏固工程的考慮因素有否優化的空間（例如更有彈性地按實際情況提升重複發生山泥傾瀉事故的斜坡在計劃內的優次）；
土拓署應繼續透過逐步增加的斜坡監測及管理數據，配合人工智能及大數據分析，提升當局對防治山泥傾瀉工程及斜坡維修審核的管理，以及部署山泥傾瀉事故後的應對工作；
土拓署應研究將涉及政府人造斜坡事故的調查及善後工作等納入斜坡維修審核範圍，以期從多角度審視斜坡維修部門的工作有否進一步提升的空間，以汲取經驗，防患於未然；以及
各相關部門（包括地政總署、路政署、水務署及建築署）可一同透過土拓署正在建立的中央斜坡維修資料庫，多利用「智慧斜坡記錄冊」作數據分析，掌握最新的斜坡維修狀況、分享常見的維修保養問題、評估暴雨對斜坡的影響，從而協助部門計劃日常維修檢查和於惡劣天氣後的特別巡查工作，藉以提升效率。

At present, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong serve as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The HHB announced today (January 8) the latest figures of these services:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1, 2025, (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow‑up appointments and medication refill service points, from the Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts. As of January 6, the DHCs hotlines across all 18 districts have received 265 enquiries in total.

Free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners and free denture replacement services

  The HHB introduced a free family doctor service scheme, free CM consultation services, and free denture replacement services on December 4, 15, and 23, 2025, respectively to support the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents until February 28 this year. Case managers of the DHCs will arrange for them to receive up to three free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners respectively based on their individual situations and preferences, covering the provision of medication and related treatments; and at least one free dental consultation and one follow-up appointment (subject to clinical need), covering denture replacement and oral treatment services.

  As of January 6, more than 300 private family doctors have participated in the free family doctor service scheme, covering more than 450 service points that include eight private hospitals. So far, 78 affected residents have been arranged to receive free family doctor consultations. As for the free CM consultation services, more than 360 CM practitioners have participated, covering more than 620 service points, and 30 residents have been arranged to receive the services so far. Regarding free denture replacement services, more than 100 private dentists have participated, covering over 130 service points, and 23 residents have been arranged to receive free denture replacement services so far.

HA's healthcare services

  All individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the HA will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation. A total of 79 patients received treatment at various public hospitals due to the fire. As of January 6, 69 of them had already recovered and were discharged, and the remaining 10 are in stable condition. Healthcare staff will continue to provide appropriate treatment and care to these patients.

  Moreover, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31 this year. The waivers cover in-patient services, family medicine and specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs) services (including psychiatry SOPCs), accident and emergency services, day hospitals, day procedures, community services, and Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres under the HA. As of January 6, the HA has provided necessary healthcare services to around 1 700 affected residents.

Mental health support

  The 18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline immediately deployed additional staff and strengthened training for its call handlers on the day of the fire incident to cope with the emotional distress that the public may experience due to the incident. From the time of the incident to January 6, the hotline has received over 12 800 calls, around 700 of which were related to the fire incident. The WhatsApp service has handled over 600 messages, with about 50 of them concerning the fire incident. The HA's 24-hour Mental Health Direct hotline, manned by psychiatric nurses, offers professional advice and support on mental health issues to callers, including provision of risk assessments and referrals to the HA's mental health services as appropriate. As of January 6, the Mental Health Direct hotline has received 94 calls related to the fire incident, with 34 of them coming from affected citizens.

  The HHB will continue to provide comprehensive primary healthcare support to affected residents. The HHB also designed the relevant service workflow from the residents' perspective, allowing them to receive convenient and effective medical support simply through the DHCs (see Annex 2)."
