Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-08 19:17,2025-09-08 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800792.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 8), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  ""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are still experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

周和副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室社會工作部副部長）、葛珮帆主席（智慧城市聯盟督導委員會主席、大灣區低空經濟聯盟創會會長）、楊文銳會長（智慧城市聯盟會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家午安！很高興出席智慧城市聯盟成立十周年暨大灣區低空經濟聯盟成立一周年的慶祝酒會。首先，讓我們一起向兩個聯盟表示最熱烈的祝賀！

過去幾年，在政府與各界的共同努力下，香港在智慧城市建設方面取得了不少扎實的進展。從金融科技到便捷出行，從環境監測到智慧政府，科技正全方位融入我們的生活。它提升了市民的生活質素，也改變了城市的面貌。

十年來，智慧城市聯盟積極建言獻策，匯聚業界和學界等多方力量和資源，推動人才培育、促進公私營協作，為香港的創科發展注入了更多新動能。而大灣區低空經濟聯盟的成立，更是在這個基礎上，推動香港和大灣區在低空經濟領域的協作和發展，為區域融合開創新維度。我對兩個聯盟一直以來的勤奮耕耘和貢獻，表示衷心的感謝！

當前，人工智能正以前所未有的速度驅動科技變革，引領智慧城市進入新的發展階段。香港作為國際金融、貿易和航運中心，正積極把握這一趨勢，全力推進智慧城市建設。這不僅可提升我們國際大都會的競爭力和吸引力，更與香港國際創科中心建設的定位相輔相成。

今日，我想就特區政府智慧城市發展策略中的兩點，即數據與人工智能扼要談談。

第一是數據的運用，即如何讓數據更深度接入生活的各個層面，讓它的價值更全面、更高效的釋放出來。我們的策略圍繞三個關鍵詞：開放、應用和互通。

開放數據，就是為社會各行各業提供智慧轉型的原材料。我們目前提供超過5 600個數據集，年度下載量已經突破600億次。由發展局開發的一站式空間數據共享平台就是其中一個例子，它在三年前開始啓用，以可視化地圖方式，提供規劃、地政、屋宇、交通、人口、工程等不同範疇的數據，去年數據的下載量超過122萬次，是二○二三年的四倍。這個項目也一直獲得智慧城市聯盟的積極支持。

未來，我們會適時、適度進一步擴大數據開放的範圍。

數據應用方面，特區政府除了在城市管理、交通、環境、社福等方面更廣泛應用數據以支持決策和進行規劃，也希望通過共享數據讓公私營的服務可以更便捷和普惠包容。香港金融管理局推出的商業數據通就是成功案例，讓中小企將其業務數據與銀行分享，便利其融資。自二○二二年推出至今年六月，商業數據通已協助處理超過61 000 宗貸款申請，總額超過500億港元。這個平台更已與政府授權數據交換閘對接，以涵蓋公司註冊處及土地註冊處的數據。根據現有數據的覆蓋範圍，約15萬間本港中小企可受惠於這個平台。

以上的例子自然地把我們帶到數據互通這議題上。事實上，數據互通有助推動低空經濟的發展。我們正研究建立低空飛行三維資訊樞紐，它將銜接空間數據共享平台，通過多元數據的整合，促進跨界別應用。

數據互通還有跨境的面向。在「一國兩制」下，香港同時匯聚內地和國際數據，是我們推動智慧城市發展的獨特優勢，對香港在人工智能、大數據和醫藥產業領域的研究和發展，也有很大的促進作用。在中央相關部委支持下，我們前年已與廣東省制定《大灣區標準合同》（《粵港澳大灣區（內地、香港）個人信息跨境流動標準合同》），促進兩地數據的安全流通。與此同時，我們亦正在河套深港創科園，推動數據以及資金、人才和其他生產要素自由流動的政策。

至於第二點——人工智能（AI）是不得不提的。AI正改變世界，它與各產業深度融合，大大提升生產力、改變產業模式，以及人們消費出行的模式，正深刻重塑企業之間、不同經濟體之間的競爭力，同時也為城市發展帶來質變和量變。AI應用可以減低能源消耗，也可以提供更高效和個性化的服務，這些只是眾多應用場景的實例。特區政府將AI定為核心產業，從算法、算力、數據、資金和人才等五方面加速推動其發展，促進其技術研發與應用，讓AI更廣泛賦能城市運作，提升市民生活質素。

可以預見，數據和人工智能的結合，將開創更多智慧應用場景，為各行各業帶來新動能、新機遇。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，智慧城市聯盟和大灣區低空經濟聯盟自成立以來，一直是特區政府的緊密夥伴。未來，我期待你們在以下三方面進一步助力香港的智慧城市建設。一是鼓勵創新科技的研發與應用，開拓更多應用場景；二是推動政、產、學、研、投全鏈條與城市發展的更緊密結合；三是加強人才培訓與國際交流，提升香港在智慧城市領域的國際影響力和話語權。

最後，我再次感謝兩個聯盟的貢獻，祝願你們竿頭猛進，再創高峰！也祝願今日出席酒會的各位朋友身體健康、事業宏達！謝謝大家！"

HA commences seasonal influenza vaccination programme,2025-09-08 18:51,2025-09-08 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800688.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  Public hospitals and outpatient clinics of the Hospital Authority (HA) will start providing seasonal influenza vaccinations to eligible persons starting from September 25 (Thursday) to dovetail with the Government Vaccination Programme 2025/26.

  Under the Government Vaccination Programme this year, the HA will mainly provide seasonal influenza vaccinations to eligible patients who have follow-up appointments at HA clinics or are admitted to public hospitals, including:


Persons aged 6 months to under 18 years, and those 50 years or above;
Pregnant women;
Eligible persons with intellectual or physical disabilities;
Persons aged 18 to 49 years with chronic medical problems; and
Long-stay in-patients.


  The list of public hospitals and outpatient clinics providing vaccinations is set out in the Annex.

  Eligible patients may receive vaccinations at their scheduled follow-up appointments at clinics. Patients with distant follow-up appointment dates may visit or contact the respective clinics for necessary arrangements.

  The HA spokesperson appealed to members of the public to receive vaccinations early. ""The risk of influenza transmission increases in winter. Vaccinations can enhance immunity against influenza and greatly reduce the risk of serious illness or death from infection. The protection will last for at least six months, protecting members of the public during the winter influenza season. Since it takes about two to four weeks to develop protection after inoculation, the public is urged to receive flu jabs early.""

  Individuals aged 18 or above should register with eHealth before receiving vaccinations.

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-09-08 18:10,2025-09-08 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800783.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 8) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 31 to September 6, the CHP recorded seven LD cases. Among these, two were imported cases and five were community-acquired cases. All of the patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:

Community-acquired cases:

an 82-year-old male patient living in Sai Kung District;
a 54-year-old male patient living in Kwai Tsing District;
a 61-year-old male patient living in Tai Po District;
a 66-year-old male patient living in Kwun Tong District; and
a 69-year-old male patient living in Sham Shui Po District.


Imported cases:

a 49-year-old male patient who travelled to the Mainland during the incubation period; and
a 75-year-old male patient who travelled to the Mainland during the incubation period.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that all seven cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of September 6, 121 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


  The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-09-08 18:10,2025-09-08 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800781.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（九月八日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在八月三十一日至九月六日期間，衞生防護中心錄得七宗退伍軍人病個案，當中兩宗屬輸入個案，五宗屬社區感染，全部病人均有長期病患。詳情如下：

社區感染個案：

82歲男病人，居於西貢區；
54歲男病人，居於葵青區；
61歲男病人，居於大埔區；
66歲男病人，居於觀塘區；及
69歲男病人，居於深水埗區。


輸入個案：

49歲男病人，於潛伏期內曾到內地；及
75歲男病人，於潛伏期內曾到內地。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示七宗個案全部屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這些個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至九月六日，今年錄得121宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-09-08 17:33,2025-09-08 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800785.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on September 5 to noon today (September 8), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 315 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 100 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website
(www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 163 767 samples of food imported from Japan (including 107 114 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 37 050 samples of local catch respectively.

  Among the 13th batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering five survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent.

  The FEHD has so far released 13 batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 46 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Thirteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

  Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


  Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

  âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

Seasonal influenza vaccination programmes comprising five new initiatives to enable and increase public participation begin later this month,2025-09-08 16:35,2025-09-08 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800487.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced today (September 8) that the 2025/26 Seasonal Influenza Vaccination (SIV) Programmes, including the SIV School Outreach Programme, the Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme and the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme (VSS), will commence on September 25. Eligible high-risk groups can receive a free or subsidised SIV through various vaccination programmes. Getting vaccinated well before the winter influenza season can effectively protect one's health and that of one's family.

Severe influenza cases drop by 20 per cent as vaccination uptake hits record high
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

""Vaccination has been scientifically proven to be one of the most effective means to prevent severe cases of seasonal influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risks of in-patient admission and mortality due to seasonal influenza. During the previous influenza season (2024/25), severe influenza cases decreased significantly among adults and children by 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively compared to the influenza seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. School outbreaks of influenza-like illnesses also plummeted by nearly 90 per cent. We believe this is attributable to higher vaccination rates. Under various SIV Programmes, approximately 2.09 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines were administered, marking an increase of over 10 per cent compared to the 2023/24 influenza season and setting a new historical high. Additionally, SIV coverage rates have increased across all age groups,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The local winter influenza season usually begins in January, while the summer surge occurs from July to August. Although no summer influenza has been observed so far this year, the latest surveillance data on the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses, and the influenza-related admission rate in public hospitals, has indicated an upward trend in seasonal influenza activity. The CHP will monitor the trend of influenza activity in the next few weeks.

Five new initiatives of SIV programmes
------------------------------------------------------

""To encourage more residents to receive seasonal influenza vaccines and further increase SIV coverage, the Government will introduce five new initiatives this year to enable public access to seasonal influenza vaccines. These include: expanding the eligible group; further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme to cater to students' needs; providing recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV) to better protect elderly living in institutions; launching a pilot scheme to procure part of the seasonal influenza vaccine for private doctors to help stabilise the supply of vaccines; and optimising information dissemination,"" Dr Tsui said.

(1) Expanding eligibility coverage
In addition to previously eligible groups, all individuals aged 18 to 49 with chronic medical conditions are eligible for free or subsidised influenza vaccinations this year, regardless of financial status. The eligible groups and public locations offering free or subsidised SIV are listed in the annex.

(2) Further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme
In early June, the CHP wrote to all secondary schools, primary schools and kindergartens/child care centres in Hong Kong, inviting them to participate in the SIV School Outreach Programme this season. The CHP also highlighted this year's new initiative, i.e. all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV (nasal vaccines)) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools being allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities. Approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) have joined the outreach programme. To safeguard students' health, the CHP will publish a list of schools not participating in the programme on its official website to remind parents to promptly arrange for children in those schools to receive vaccinations from family doctors.

(3) Providing RIV for elderly living in institutions
The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases under the CHP recommended that RIV be preferred for older adults living in residential care homes in order to provide better protection. In light of this, the CHP has successfully procured RIV this year. Through the Residential Care Home Vaccination Programme, all residents of residential care homes for the elderly and residents aged 65 or above in residential care homes for persons with disabilities can receive the vaccine.

(4) Pilot scheme on vaccine procurement for family doctors
To enhance vaccine supply stability and ensure that eligible high-risk groups can receive SIV through the VSS, the DH has also helped procure an additional 100 000 doses of injectable IIV forSpecified VSS Family Doctors this year, in addition to continuing to procure vaccines for itself, the Hospital Authority and relevant institutions. Family doctors who accept this arrangement cannot charge recipients any additional fees, thereby reducing the financial burden on citizens and providing additional incentives for them to receive vaccinations at private clinics.

(5) Optimising information dissemination
The website providing information on private doctors participating in the VSS will be optimised to allow doctors to update their details in real time. The website's search function will also be enhanced to enable members of the public to search for doctors who offer vaccines without any co-payment, or vaccination venues for different types of seasonal influenza vaccines.

To help members of the public manage their personal health records and healthcare services more effectively, and facilitate continuity of care provided by healthcare professionals, eligible individuals aged 18 or above must register for eHealth starting this year to receive subsidised or free seasonal influenza vaccines.

Over 1 000 vaccination sites available for public convenience
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To make vaccinations more accessible, the Government will open all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the 25 District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Starting from 9am on September 22, parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via the online booking system.

Over 1 500 doctors have applied to join the VSS. The Government will provide a subsidy of $260 per dose of vaccination. For the list of VSS doctors, please visit:apps.hcv.gov.hk/Public/en/SPS/Search.

The sooner one receives seasonal influenza vaccines the better
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases recommended that the vaccine combination for the 2025/26 influenza season should align with the latest recommendations from the World Health Organization. The use of various locally registered trivalent and quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccines was recommended, including injectable IIV, LAIV (nasal vaccines) and injectable RIV. For more information, please refer to the Scientific Committee's recommendations.

Dr Tsui reminded the public that it takes approximately two weeks for the body to develop sufficient antibodies for effective protection after receiving the seasonal influenza vaccine. Therefore, for the sake of personal and public health, individuals should get vaccinated as early as possible before the onset of the winter influenza season.

For more information on the SIV programmes, visit the webpage or call the CHP during office hours at 2125 2125."
流感疫苗接種計劃月底展開　五大新猷鼓勵和便利市民接種,2025-09-08 16:35,2025-09-08 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800485.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月八日）宣布，二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃（包括季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃、院舍防疫注射計劃及疫苗資助計劃）將於九月二十五日展開，合資格的高風險群組可透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。在踏入冬季流感季節前盡早接種流感疫苗，方可有效保障自己和家人的健康。

疫苗接種創新高流感重症下跌兩成
————————————————

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據科學實證，接種疫苗是預防季節性流感重症及其併發症的最有效方法之一，亦可減低感染流感而導致入院留醫或死亡的風險。上一年度（二○二四／二五年），成人和兒童嚴重流感個案較新冠疫情前的流感季節分別顯著下跌兩成和六成，學校爆發流感樣疾病更大跌近九成，我們相信是歸功於疫苗接種率上升。衞生署的各項疫苗接種計劃共接種約209萬劑季節性流感疫苗，較前一個流感季節（二○二三／二四年）上升超過一成，創下歷史新高。另外，各年齡組別的疫苗覆蓋率均出現上升。」

本港冬季流感季節一般於一月開始，而夏季高峰期則在七月至八月間出現。雖然本港今年暫未出現夏季流感，但根據最新呼吸道樣本中檢測到季節性流感病毒的百分比和公立醫院流感相關入院率的監測數據，現時季節性流感的活躍程度呈現上升波幅。中心需要留意未來數周的流感趨勢。

疫苗接種計劃五大新猷
——————————

徐醫生說：「為了鼓勵更多市民接種季節性流感疫苗，以進一步提高疫苗覆蓋率，政府今年推出五大新猷，便利市民接種季節性流感疫苗，包括擴大合資格組別人士；進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃以迎合學童的需要；提供重組流感疫苗，更好保護院舍長者；推出先導計劃為私家醫生採購部分季節性流感疫苗以協助穩定疫苗供應；及優化資訊發放。」

（一）擴大資助範圍
除了以往合資格免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗的人士外，所有18至49歲長期病患人士，不論經濟狀況，本年度亦可接種免費或獲資助流感疫苗。合資格人士的組別和可免費接種流感疫苗的公營地點見附件。

​（二）進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃
中心於六月初去信全港中小學、幼稚園／幼兒中心，邀請他們參與新一季的季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，並介紹今年的新措施──所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。目前已有約2 300間學校（99%）參與外展計劃。中心稍後會將不參與計劃的學校名單上載至中心網頁，以提醒有關學校的家長盡快自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種疫苗，守護學童健康。

（三）提供重組流感疫苗予院舍長者
中心轄下的疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）建議，居住院舍的長者應優先接種重組流感疫苗，以提供更好保護。有見及此，中心今年成功採購了重組流感疫苗，所有安老院舍院友及年滿65歲或以上的殘疾人士院舍院友均可透過「院舍防疫注射計劃」接種。​​

（四）家庭醫生疫苗採購先導計劃
為加強疫苗供應的穩定性，確保合資格高風險群組可透過「疫苗資助計劃」接種季節性流感疫苗，衞生署今年除了繼續為衞生署、醫院管理局及相關機構採購疫苗外，亦額外為參與「疫苗資助計劃」的「指定家庭醫生」協助採購了10萬劑注射式滅活流感疫苗，接受有關安排的家庭醫生不可向接種人士收取任何額外費用，以減低市民於私家診所接種疫苗的經濟負擔，提升接種誘因。

（五）優化資訊發放
提供參加「疫苗資助計劃」私家醫生資訊的網站會優化，讓私家醫生實時更新其資訊。網站亦加強搜尋功能，方便市民選擇有提供免共付額疫苗的醫生，或者尋找不同類型流感疫苗的接種點等。​

另外，為協助市民更有效管理個人健康及醫護服務，同時便利醫護人員提供具連貫性的個人醫療服務，18歲或以上的合資格人士由本年度開始須登記醫健通，才能接種資助或免費季節性流感疫苗。

逾千個接種點方便市民
——————————

為了讓市民更加方便接種疫苗，政府會繼續開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下的25個地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間普通科門診和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可由九月二十二日上午九時起透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

另外，現時有超過1 500名醫生已申請參與「疫苗資助計劃」，政府會提供每劑260元資助，相關醫生名單資料可參閱網頁：apps.hcv.gov.hk/public/tc/SPS/Search。

接種季節性流感疫苗宜早不宜遲
———————————————

科學委員會建議二○二五／二六年度流感季節採用的疫苗組合應與世界衞生組織的最新建議相符。科學委員會建議可使用各種在本地註冊的三價和四價季節性流感疫苗，包括注射式滅活流感疫苗、噴鼻式減活流感疫苗和注射式重組流感疫苗，詳情可參閱科學委員會建議（只有英文）。

徐醫生提醒市民，接種季節性流感疫苗後，身體需要兩星期才能產生足夠抗體作有效保護。因此，為己為人，市民應於冬季流感季節來臨前，盡早接種疫苗。

Good afternoon, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a privilege to address you at the 2025 Hong Kong Green Finance Association Annual Forum, themed ""Navigating Climate Finance and Geopolitics: Strategies for Transition"".

As Asia's premier international financial centre, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to channel global capital toward a sustainable future. Amid geopolitical complexities, trade uncertainties, and the urgent need for climate actions, our city is poised to lead the green transition across Asia and beyond.

Let me reaffirm Hong Kong's role as Asia's leading green finance hub. Last year, our green and sustainable debt market, encompassing bonds and loans, surpassed US$84 billion. Green and sustainable bonds alone reached US$43 billion, capturing 45 per cent of the regional market and securing Hong Kong's position as Asia's top-ranked green bond market for seven consecutive years since 2018.

To sustain this leadership, we have adopted a four-pillar strategy in partnership with financial regulators and industry stakeholders, including (i) promoting market development, (ii) fostering financial innovation, (iii) enhancing sustainability transparency, and (iv) nurturing talent and enhancing data. Allow me to elaborate on each.

First pillar: promoting market development

Our Government Sustainable Bond Programme, expanded in May last year to cover sustainability on top of green projects, drives the development of sustainable initiatives by the Government and our green bond market. As of June this year, we have issued approximately HK$240 billion equivalent in green bonds, denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi, euros, and US dollars, with tenors ranging from one to 30 years. These issuances provide a critical benchmark for other issuers in Hong Kong and the region.

The programme supports projects across nine categories, including, for example, renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation, pollution prevention and control, waste management and resource recovery, and more. To date, it has funded 116 local green projects. Our annual Green Bond Report, with the 2025 edition due this month, details the allocation of proceeds and environmental benefits, reinforcing transparency and credibility.

Bond issuances aside, we have also been developing the carbon market. The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) operates Core Climate, an international carbon marketplace enabling transparent trading of carbon credits to support global net-zero transition. It is the only platform offering settlement in Hong Kong dollars and Renminbi for international voluntary carbon credits. By the end of last year, Core Climate has attracted 100 participants. Carbon credits traded on the platform are sourced from certified projects for example in forestry, solar, wind, and biomass across Asia, South America, and Africa, aiding governments and businesses in furthering their efforts for low-carbon transition.

The HKEX has also signed Memoranda of Understanding with Mainland China's carbon markets, including the Beijing and Shenzhen Green Exchanges, to share expertise and foster regional collaboration.

Also, Hong Kong has advanced our green finance ecosystem beyond green bonds and the carbon market through the development of a local green classification framework. The Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, covering 12 key economic activities, was launched last year with a view to standardising green classification, reducing greenwashing risks, and enhancing information for decision making by investors. We are engaging the industry to expand the taxonomy, and will widen the scope of sectors and economic activities to include transition elements and additional sustainable activities, reinforcing our role as a leading sustainable and transition finance hub.

Second pillar: fostering financial innovation

Innovation is central to our green finance development strategy, and will inspire more ways to tackle the global problem of climate change. Hong Kong has pioneered the world's first government-issued tokenised green bond and the first multi-currency digital bond. These initiatives demonstrate our leadership in bond markets, green finance, and fintech. Tokenised bonds enable efficient settlement, broaden investor access, enhance interoperability, and improve transparency and efficiency. Continuing the success of our earlier issuance, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing our third tokenised bond issuance, advancing our plans for regularised offerings.

To integrate fintech with green finance, we are expanding our green fintech ecosystem, positioning Hong Kong as a regional green fintech hub. The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group updated the Hong Kong Green Fintech Map this year, providing a comprehensive overview of green fintech companies and services and facilitating adoption and application.

Also, we launched the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme last year, offering early-stage funding to eligible technology companies and research institutes in Hong Kong. So far 60 projects have been approved, advancing commercialisation and adoption.

As for further innovation in carbon market, the HKMA's Project Ensemble explores tokenised deposits and Central Bank Digital Currency for interbank settlement, as well as tokenisation of real-world assets including carbon credits via blockchain. We are also exploring collaborations with central bank peers on enhancing transparency and efficiency in carbon credit trading through blockchain technology.

Third pillar: enhancing sustainability transparency

As sustainable development gains global prominence, ensuring accurate and consistent sustainability information is critical for investors and market participants. In December last year, we launched the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong, outlining a clear path for large publicly accountable entities to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Sustainability Disclosure Standards by 2028.

In June this year, the IFRS Foundation recognised Hong Kong as one of the first jurisdictions to commit to fully adopting ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) standards, underscoring our dedication to transparency in capital markets. This facilitates informed investment decisions and promotes global capital flows via our trusted market.

Also, our Stock Exchange has introduced enhanced climate-related disclosure requirements, based on the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures, phasing in for listed companies from the beginning of this year.

As for the support to SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in sustainability reporting, our Steering Group is enhancing the Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies/SMEs. Launched in 2022, the Questionnaire is intended to provide a free and easy-to-use sustainability reporting template to corporates in need, facilitating their understanding of sustainability performance and raising their sustainability profiles to lenders, investors, and supply chain clients. Taking into account industry feedback and latest market developments, the Steering Group is enhancing the Questionnaire to make it more accessible and inclusive. The 2.0 version of the Questionnaire will soon be rolled out on the website of the Steering Group. Please watch out for that. Going forward, we will collaborate with the industry further to promote the usage of the Questionnaire.

Fourth pillar: nurturing talent and enhancing data

Building a skilled workforce is essential for advancing our green finance development. We launched the Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme for local market practitioners, professionals, students, and graduates. By July this year, the scheme has a coverage of 95 programmes and qualifications, including banking, asset management, insurance, and more, from local and international providers. Over 7,600 applications have been approved, totaling more than HK$42 million in reimbursements. We will extend this scheme to 2028 to sustain our efforts in talent development.

Finally, it is important for us to enhance investor education and understanding on green finance through better data, equipping stakeholders with analytical tools and insights for informed decision-making. The Steering Group has thus launched a data portal, containing Government data sources for assessing physical risks in Hong Kong, such as historical data on catastrophe damages and tropical cyclone impact data. We encourage the use of the tools and technology to enhance data availability and understanding of the impact of climate change in Hong Kong. We also hope it would in turn facilitate development of more targeted sustainable finance and technology solutions enabled by data insights.

Before I conclude, I would like to invite all of you to engage in Hong Kong Green Week, our flagship sustainability event. This platform fosters collaboration among global stakeholders, and your active participation is vital to shaping a sustainable future.

Hong Kong's four-pillar strategy including promoting market development, fostering innovation, enhancing transparency, and nurturing talent and enhancing data, positions us well to navigate the global challenges of climate change. By driving these initiatives, we are not only maintaining our leadership but also forging a collaborative, resilient and sustainable path forward. In this regard, I definitely look forward to continue our collaboration with HKGFA and Dr Ma (Chairman and President of HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun), and I urge you to join us in this global endeavor, turning visions into actions for a greener future. Thank you."

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

Dr. Ma (Chairman and President of HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun), Professor Li (Professor of Political Science and Founding Director of the Centre on Contemporary China and the World of the University of Hong Kong, Dr Li Cheng), Dr. Berglöf (Chief Economist, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Dr Erik Berglöf), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the eighth edition of the Hong Kong Green Finance Association Annual Forum.

 This year's Forum marks the opening of Hong Kong Green Week. This week, leading voices from global financial institutions, corporations and policy circles will engage in essential discussions on sustainable finance, climate technologies, impact investing and regional green co-operation. They'll share knowledge, experiences and explore how green transformation can create fresh opportunities, particularly in the face of a volatile geopolitical landscape.

A world of contrast

 Let me begin by acknowledging some uncomfortable realities. The urgency of the climate crisis is clearer than ever, and we are all witnessing it and feeling it first-hand, in the unprecedented heatwaves from Europe to Japan and the numerous black rainstorms that have battered our city this summer.

 This devastating reality is compounded by rising unilateralism. The US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and an overt policy shift back to fossil fuels, are disappointing. It weakens the collective commitment to climate action and, no less important, complicates the US$1.3 trillion annual climate-finance target for developing countries, reached at COP 29 (the 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).

 Still, we must not lose hope. Many countries remain firmly committed to net-zero transition, in particular our country, China, which stands by its 3060 goals. According to estimates, our country's CO2 emissions in the first quarter this year fell by 1.6 per cent year on year. This is the first time that clean-energy expansion is leading the fall in CO2 level, and that's despite rapid growth in power demand. China is expected to invest some US$820 billion in energy transition this year, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the global total.

 Moreover, its national emissions trading scheme continues to expand, now covering 70 per cent of the country's emissions, including key polluting sectors such as cement, steel and aluminium.

 Across Asia and the Global South, the progress is also encouraging. In the Asia-Pacific region, investment in energy transition, last year, surpassed US$1 trillion for the first time. That's more than double the amount invested in the Americas. ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states reaffirmed their commitment to climate resilience at their recent summit, underscoring the priority the region has accorded to climate action. For Belt and Road economies as a whole, renewable energy now constitutes 30 per cent of their total energy investments, up from less than 5 per cent just a decade ago.

 Technological advancements are also offering new hope. Beyond solar power and electric vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force.The International Energy Agency predicts that, by 2035, the widespread use of AI could reduce global energy consumption by an amount greater than the total energy usage of Mexico.

How Hong Kong can contribute

 Here in Hong Kong, we remain steadfast in our commitment to climate action. We are on track to cut our carbon emissions in half by 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This goal is anchored in four key strategies: decarbonising power generation, improving energy efficiency in buildings, promoting green transport and reducing waste.

 In power generation, we are making pleasing progress. By 2026, with the completion of enhancements to the cross-boundary Clean Energy Transmission System, the share of zero-carbon electricity in our fuel mix is expected to rise from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. We are also planning for the construction of new facilities in Tseung Kwan O to further expand our capacity to import zero-carbon energy. Upon completion of the project, the share of zero-carbon energy in our fuel mix could increase to about 60 to 70 per cent.

 Beyond fulfilling our domestic commitments, Hong Kong has much more to offer the world. As an international financial centre and an innovation hub, we are well positioned to contribute to global green transition.

On green and sustainable finance

 Hong Kong has long been Asia's frontrunner in green and sustainable finance. In 2024, we issued more than US$80 billion in sustainable debts, with green bonds accounting for around 45 per cent of the regional total. Estimated issuances of sustainable debts in the first half of 2025 reached over US$34billion, an increase of 15 per cent year on year.Over 200 ESG(environmental, social and governance)funds have been authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission, with an AUM (assets under management) exceeding US$140 billion, up more than 50 per cent in just three years. These figures speak volumes about our growing role as a green financing and investment hub.

 And we have been doing more than that. For example, in the area of transition finance. While it still represents a small fraction of the sustainable finance markets, it is gaining a traction and offers considerable prospects. For instance, transition bonds account for only around 3 per cent of the sustainable bonds market in the ASEAN+3 Market. Hong Kong obviously has the potential to become a transition finance hub, helping hard-to-abate sectors to decarbonise.

 Separately, last year, we issued the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, which aligns with the frameworks of both the Chinese Mainland and the European Union. Today, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) begins a public consultation to expand this taxonomy to cover transition finance. Other elements include expanding sector coverage and introducing climate change adaptation. These are pivotal to scaling up capital flows to accelerate green transformation.

 Taking a broader perspective, setting and upholding international standards are important if we are to attract and channel more investments to green and transition projects. Hong Kong is proud to contribute to the setting of the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) reporting standards and the related disclosure framework. As confirmed by the IFRS Foundation (the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) in June this year, Hong Kong is one of the few jurisdictions in Asia with a clear roadmap for full adoption.

 We are also working to mobilise more capital across the public and private sectors. The HKMA has entered into strategic partnerships with multilateral organisations to co-invest in climate and development projects. And our vibrant venture capital and private-equity sector, plus the concentration of wealthy family offices and high-net-worth individuals, are great resources. A study shows that 87 per cent of high-net-worth investors are eager to support climate-focused investments. There is even stronger interest in transition investing than in sustainable investing.

 In this regard, there is great potential in developing innovative, climate-focused financial products that cater to market appetite. 

Expanding green innovation

 Beyond finance, technological innovation is the engine that will drive green transformation. On this, Hong Kong is emerging as a green technology hub. Today, more than 250 green tech companies are based in Science Park and Cyberport. These firms are developing globally competitive solutions – from smart grid to carbon capture technologies. They are expanding rapidly into the Mainland and international markets.

 And, through the coordinated efforts of the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, OASES (Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises), Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, we are attracting prime green enterprises from around the world. These companies span a wide array of technologies – from AI-driven green solutions to sustainable aviation fuel, electric mobility infrastructure and next-generation power systems.

 We are helping them to connect with Hong Kong universities and supply chains, identify more application scenarios and tap into markets across the Greater Bay Area, Asia and beyond.

 Just as I said earlier, AI can power green transition. It can help traditional industries and sectors optimise production processes and energy consumption, thereby substantially reducing their carbon footprint. Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry. I'm confident that many AI solutions for decarbonisation can scale here and make a lasting impact.

Closing

 Ladies and gentlemen, there is only one earth, one planet that we all share. While the world may be facing substantial geopolitical challenges, Hong Kong is fully committed to becoming a reliable and resourceful partner in the global green transformation.

 Through forums like this, we reaffirm our commitment to collaboration and partnership. In the space of sustainable finance, technology, talent and many other areas, we can work together to turn climate challenges into rewarding opportunities.

 On this note, I wish the Forum and Hong Kong Green Week every success, and all of you the best of health and business.

 Thank you."

CHP appeals for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions,2025-09-08 10:07,2025-09-08 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800338.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 8) appealed to members of the public for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions and urged them to maintain personal and environmental hygiene. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

  Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Burkholderia pseudomallei is widespread in soil and muddy water, particularly common in moist clay soil. Humans can become infected through contact with contaminated soil and surface water (especially through skin abrasions/wounds); inhalation of contaminated dust/water droplets; and ingestion of contaminated water. Those with underlying diseases or immunosuppression have higher risks of contracting the disease.

According to overseas literature and local data, Burkholderia pseudomallei in the soil and muddy water may be exposed to the ground after typhoons or storms, and the bacteria would spread more easily with strong wind and storms. As such, infection cases are more common after typhoons or storms.

In view of the recent disturbance caused by typhoon andconsecutive days of torrential rain, the CHP again reminded members of the public, in particular high-risk groups such as those with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water as far as practicable, to prevent melioidosis infection.

Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong and human infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. As of yesterday (September 7), eight melioidosis infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded. In light of the cluster of melioidosis cases recorded in Sham Shui Po in 2022, the CHP and the Water Supplies Department have implemented a series of precautionary and monitoring measures, including the installation of high efficiency particulate air filters at the ventilators of all fresh water service reservoirs in Hong Kong, enhancing residual chlorine levels in drinking water, continual monitoring of residual chlorine level of fresh water in service reservoirs and consumers' taps, as well as health education and surveillance of infection cases. No abnormalities were detected from all surveillance results so far, including those conducted after typhoons and heavy rain, while the drinking water quality monitoring results have consistently been in compliance with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

Person-to-person transmission andanimal-to-human transmission are rare but may occur through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Melioidosis may present with localised infection (such as cutaneous abscess), pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or chronic suppurative infection. Depending on the site of infection, common symptoms of melioidosis include fever, headache, localised pain or swelling, ulceration, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, and swelling of regional lymph nodes. The CHP appealed again to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromised conditions, in order to receive appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

The CHP reminded members of the public to take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. usinggloves and wearing boots;
If exposure to contaminated water or soil is inevitable, high-risk individuals should wear a mask, gloves and boots;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soilor gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

衞生防護中心呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺預防類鼻疽感染,2025-09-08 10:06,2025-09-08 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090800337.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（九月八日）呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺，保持個人及環境衞生，預防感染類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

類鼻疽是一種由類鼻疽伯克氏菌引致的疾病。類鼻疽伯克氏菌廣泛存在於土壤和泥水中，特別是濕潤的黏土。人類可能通過接觸受污染的土壤和水源（尤其是經皮膚損傷／傷口）、吸入受污染的微塵／水滴和飲用受污染的水而受到感染。長期病患者及免疫力弱人士有較大機會受感染。

根據海外文獻和本地數據，在颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令類鼻疽病菌更容易散播，令感染個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。

因應近期本港受颱風以及連日暴雨影響，中心再次提醒市民，特別是高風險群組例如長期病患者，盡量避免接觸土壤或泥水，以免受類鼻疽病菌感染。

類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得人類感染類鼻疽個案。截至昨日（九月七日），本港今年錄得八宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。因應二○二二年深水埗出現的類鼻疽群組個案，中心及水務署已採取一系列的預防及監察措施，包括在全港所有配水庫的通風口加裝高效能空氣過濾網、加強食水的餘氯含量、持續監測配水庫及用戶水龍頭食水的餘氯含量，並加強健康教育和監測感染個案。至今包括於颱風及暴雨後所進行的監測結果未有出現異常情況，而食水水質監測的結果亦一直符合香港食水標準。

類鼻疽病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可以透過接觸患者的血液或體液而傳播。類鼻疽的病人可出現局部感染（例如皮膚膿腫）、肺炎、腦膜腦炎、敗血症或長期化膿性感染。視乎感染的部位，類鼻疽常見的病徵包括發燒、頭痛、局部痛楚或腫脹、潰瘍、胸痛、咳嗽、咳血及局部淋巴結腫大。中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。

中心再次提醒市民應採取以下措施預防感染：


避免接觸受污染的土壤；
進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿著適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴；
高風險人士如不能避免接觸受污染的水或土壤，應佩戴口罩和手套，並穿上水靴
接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

HKMA launches public consultation on Phase 2A prototype of Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance,2025-09-08 09:41,2025-09-08 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/08/P2025090500617.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) launched a public consultation today (September 8) on Phase 2A prototype of the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance (Hong Kong Taxonomy).

The Hong Kong Taxonomy is an important market enabling tool for promoting informed decision-making in green and sustainable finance. By providing clear, transparent, and robust definitions of what constitutes green and sustainable activities, the taxonomy aims to scale up relevant capital flows while addressing greenwashing concerns.

Building on the publication of Phase 1 of the Hong Kong Taxonomy in May 2024, the HKMA has adopted a phased approach to further enhance the taxonomy, starting with Phase 2A, and progressing through subsequent phases.

The Phase 2A prototype introduces several enhancements aimed at supporting Hong Kong's decarbonisation efforts, facilitating the region's transition to a low-carbon economy, and reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and a leading green finance hub. The prototype development has been guided by market feedback, government policies, industry needs, and the latest technological advancements.

The key enhancements made in the Phase 2A prototype include:


Expanded sector coverage: Two new sectors critical to the decarbonisation of the region and beyond, namely manufacturing and information and communications technology, have been added to the four sectors under Phase 1, increasing the total number of sectors from four to six;
Increase in economic activities: 13 new economic activities have been added, bringing the total number of economic activities from 12 to 25. Updates have also been made to the technical screening criteria of a number of activities introduced under Phase 1;
Transition elements: Transition elements, including interim decarbonisation targets, measures to support transition and sunset dates (which specify the time by which transition elements will conclude), have been added; and
New environmental objective: A new environmental objective, namely climate change adaptation, have been introduced to address the growing funding needs for managing physical risks and responding to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.


The public consultation commences today and will last until October 8, 2025. The consultation paper is available on the HKMA website. Interested parties are invited to submit their comments on or before the deadline."

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

  A spokesman for the LD said today (September 8) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

In collaboration with the Hong Kong US Business Association of Atlanta, the New York ETO hosted an informational session at Emory University on September 4, and met with the career centre representatives at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) on September 5. The meetings highlighted the array of opportunities available for professionals and graduates in Hong Kong.

Speaking to the undergraduate audience at Emory University, Director of the New York ETO, Ms Maisie Ho, detailed Hong Kong's competitive advantages as a global hub, including its world-class transport networks, straightforward tax system, and business-friendly environment. A key focus was the successful Top Talent Pass Scheme, which has garnered around 135 000 applications and approved nearly 109 000 since its launch in late 2022. Both Emory University and Georgia Tech are among the top eligible universities under the scheme.

On September 5, Ms Ho, accompanied by Senior Vice President of Digital Technologies and Data Infrastructure at Invest Hong Kong, Mr Marcus Woo, engaged with Atlanta-based business leaders from the innovation and technology sector at a high-level breakfast roundtable. They discussed recent developments in innovation and technology sector in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, emphasising the city's thriving startup ecosystem and strong governmental support for tech-led growth and entrepreneurship.

The visit culminated on September 6 with Ms Ho officiating at the opening ceremony of the 2025 Atlanta Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival at Lake Lanier Olympic Park. This year's festival set new records, featuring 14 out-of-state teams from Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina, alongside six breast cancer survivor teams.

In addition, Ms Ho visited downtown Gainesville to view a signature cultural landmark: a striking 14-foot-tall, 30-foot-long interactive dragon art installation, on September 5. The piece was created to honour Gainesville's longstanding role as host of the Dragon Boat Festival. She also met with the Mayor of Gainesville, Mr Sam Couvillon, to express her appreciation for the city's ongoing partnership.

""Seeing this remarkable artwork in person was a true delight. It is a beautiful tribute to our shared tradition and the vibrant cultural exchange between our peoples,"" she remarked."

AFCD appeals to public to avoid visiting country parks during typhoon,2025-09-07 20:27,2025-09-07 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700838.htm,"TV/radio announcers, please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

As a typhoon is approaching Hong Kong, for safety reasons, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department urges members of the public to avoid visiting country parks. Those who are currently in country parks should, depending on the actual circumstances, immediately leave or take shelter at a safe place."
CHP urges students to receive seasonal influenza vaccination early in new school year as one case of severe paediatric influenza A infection reported,2025-09-07 20:14,2025-09-07 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700810.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 7) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection. The CHP urged the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Schools and parents should arrange their students and children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) programme and receive free SIV to prevent contracting respiratory illnesses.

""Vaccination is the first line of defence against seasonal influenza, reducing the chance of serious complications or death after infection. Including the abovementioned case, there had been four severe paediatric influenza cases since the school resumed. Since January this year, the CHP has recorded 15 cases of severe influenza virus infection in children, 10 of them were unvaccinated in the 2024/25 season. Therefore, we hope that schools and parents could make concerted efforts with us and participate in the SIV outreach activities at school, or arrange for their children to visit their family doctor for the SIV at the start of the new school year to enhance their protection,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The case involved a 11-year-old boy with good past health. He developed a fever, a cough and running nose on September 5. He sought medical attention from a private doctor on September 6. He was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Ruttonjee Hospital and subsequently transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital the same day. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A complicated with encephalopathy. He is still hospitalised and is in stable condition.
  
The boy’s household contacts, so far, are asymptomatic. He received the SIV last October. There has been no recent influenza outbreak at the school he studied.

Besides, since the start of the new school year, there has been a significant increase in the number of outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI). The CHP recorded four ILI outbreaks in schools in the last week of August (August 24 to August 30), increased to 15 outbreaks this week (August 31 to September 6). The 19 outbreaks recorded in the two weeks include kindergartens/child care centres (five cases), primary schools (nine cases) and secondary schools (five cases).

Although Hong Kong has not entered the summer influenza season so far this year, the CHP's latest surveillance data showed that local influenza activity recently indicated an upward fluctuation and slightly exceeded the baseline threshold. The CHP will cautiously monitor the trend of influenza activity in the next few weeks.

To protect their health and that of their family members, the public should continue to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene and take the following measures to prevent contracting seasonal influenza and other respiratory illnesses:


Persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) should wear surgical masks to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses; high-risk persons (e.g. persons with underlying medical conditions or persons who are immunocompromised) should also wear surgical masks when taking public transport or staying in crowded places.
