立法會：政制及內地事務局副局長就「制訂香港特區發展願景，主動對接國家『十五五』規劃」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-01-22 11:45,2026-01-22 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200291.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局副局長胡健民今日（一月二十二日）在立法會會議上就嚴剛議員動議的「制訂香港特區發展願景，主動對接國家『十五五』規劃」議案的總結發言︰

主席：

今天是第八屆立法會成立以來第二個正式會議，議員便迅速提出有關制訂香港特區發展願景、主動對接國家「十五五」規劃的議案，並在上周的內務委員會會議上通過成立了「香港主動對接國家『十五五』規劃工作小組委員會」。這份積極作為，充分體現議員們心繫國家發展大局和香港長遠繁榮穩定的強烈使命感。我再次感謝嚴剛議員提出議案、吳傑莊議員和梁子穎議員提出修正案，以及各位議員提出的寶貴意見和建議。從大家的發言中，我深深感受到各位對國家「十五五」規劃和香港發展的熱切關心和期待，亦聽到許多創新務實的好建議。這些意見對我們制定主動對接「十五五」規劃的具體政策措施都十分重要。

為加強主動對接國家重大戰略規劃部署，行政長官在二○二二年現屆政府成立之初便已設立了「融入國家發展大局督導組」，負責推進相關工作，協調推動跨局跨部門的政策措施。進入「十五五」時期，督導組將繼續從高層次總攬、協調和監督推動對接「十五五」規劃的各項工作，務求讓全政府各政策局和部門總動員參與對接國家的戰略部署、主動作為。

就議員所提出要為香港制定中長期規劃的建議，行政長官每年發表的《施政報告》，當中的政策方向及措施是具有連貫性的，並高度對接國家的「五年規劃」。而「融入國家發展大局督導組」亦持續指導、監督、統籌各項相關工作。另外，政府亦會就個別重點政策範疇制定發展藍圖，作為中長遠發展的規劃。我十分感謝各位議員今日就如何可以更好地對接國家「十五五」規劃及為香港制定中長遠發展願景出謀獻策，我們會持續不斷完善、優化相關機制。

「十五五」規劃建議為香港發展作出重要部署，支持香港鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」的地位。習近平主席已明確指示我們需要錨定目標任務，堅定信心、乘勢而上，紮實推動高質量發展，進一步全面深化改革開放。我們必須要抓緊香港在國家整體發展戰略中的定位，更好服務國家所需，同時帶動香港發展。我現在將發言時間交給其他相關政策局的同事，就如何鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」作出介紹和回應。

我謹此致辭，多謝主席。"

Special traffic and transport arrangements for Kai Tak Stadium concerts on January 24 to 26,2026-01-22 11:10,2026-01-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200237.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (January 22) said that special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to facilitate the holding of concerts at Kai Tak Stadium on the evenings of January 24 to 26. As traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the intervals between trains on the Tuen Ma Line. The last MTR train to Lo Wu Station interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line will depart from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm. Franchised bus companies will provide 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to the Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (route No. SP12), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and Airport (route No. A25S), and major districts across the territory.

  Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day may also take the KTSP's cross-boundary coach during dispersal. Passengers should purchase tickets from the operators' online platforms in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal.

  The Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (3.30pm to 7pm) and suspended for taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid the outflux of spectators, and passengers' patience is appreciated.

  Spectators are advised to heed real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application and radio and television broadcasts."

有關個䅁涉及深水埗元州街一幢商住大廈平台上的兩個搭建物，面積共約89平方米。該等僭建物並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向業主發出清拆令。該業主沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（一月二十二日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"

The case involved two unauthorised structures with a total area of about 89 square metres on the flat roof of a composite building on Un Chau Street, Sham Shui Po. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (January 22), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

環境及生態局公布二○二四年香港溫室氣體排放清單,2026-01-22 10:10,2026-01-22 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200195.htm,"​ 環境及生態局今日（一月二十二日）公布二○二四年香港溫室氣體排放清單。

香港溫室氣體排放量持續下降，二○二四年，香港的排放總量約為3 320萬公噸二氧化碳當量，較二○二三年下降3.6%。人均溫室氣體排放量下降至4.41公噸二氧化碳當量的新低點，較二○二三年下降3.5%，約是美國的四分之一及歐盟的六成。碳強度則為每港元本地生產總值0.011千克二氧化碳當量，相較二○二三年大幅下降約6%。

香港的溫室氣體排放量已於二○一四年達峰。與二○一四年峰值比較，二○二四年的排放總量、人均排放量及碳強度分別下降約27%、30%及35%。

按最新的溫室氣體排放清單，本地最大的三個排放源仍然為發電（61%）、運輸（18%）及廢物處理（8%）。隨着香港逐步以天然氣和零碳能源取代燃煤發電、推動電動車普及化、減少棄置都市固體廢物、以及增加使用回收堆填氣體來生產能源，這三個排放源的溫室氣體排放量比較二○二三年分別下降3.5%、3.7%及9%。廢物處理的溫室氣體排放量減幅尤為顯著，主因是於堆填區的都市固體廢物棄置量減少3.4%，以及用於生產能源的堆填氣體回收量增加近12%。

為配合國家在二○三○年前碳排放量達峰，並於二○六○年前實現碳中和的「雙碳」目標，政府會繼續積極落實《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》中「淨零發電」、「節能綠建」、「綠色運輸」和「全民減廢」四個減碳策略，以實現在二○三五年前把香港的碳排放量從二○○五年的水平減半，並在二○五○年前實現碳中和。

二○二四年溫室氣體排放清單已上載至碳中和及可持續發展網頁（cnsd.gov.hk/tc/climate-ready/ghg-emissions-and-trends）。"
Hong Kong greenhouse gas emission inventory for 2024 released,2026-01-22 10:10,2026-01-22 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200196.htm,"​The Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB) released today (January 22) the 2024 greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventory for Hong Kong.

Hong Kong's GHG emissions continued their downward trend. The total GHG emissions in 2024 amounted to approximately 33.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e), representing a decrease of 3.6 per cent compared with 2023. The per capita GHG emissions continued its downward trend, reaching a new low of 4.41 tonnes CO2-e. It is 3.5 per cent lower than that in 2023 and is about a quarter of that of the United States and 60 per cent of that of the European Union. The carbon intensity was 0.011 kilograms of CO2-e per Hong Kong dollar of GDP, representing a significant decrease of about 6 per cent compared to 2023.

Hong Kong's GHG emissions peaked in 2014. Compared with the emissions peak in 2014, the total emissions, per capita GHG emissions and carbon intensity in 2024 have been reduced by about 27 per cent, 30 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.

According to the latest GHG emission inventory, the three main emission sources in Hong Kong remain to be electricity generation (61 per cent), transport (18 per cent) and waste management (8 per cent). With the gradual replacement of coal with natural gas and zero-carbon energy for electricity generation, popularisation of electric vehicles, reduction in municipal solid waste (MSW) and increase in landfill gas recovery for energy production, Hong Kong's GHG emissions from electricity generation, transport and waste management declined by 3.5 per cent, 3.7 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, compared to 2023. The reduction in GHG emissions from waste management was particularly significant. It was mainly attributable to the 3.4 per cent reduction in the quantity of MSW disposed of at landfills, and a nearly 12 per cent increase in landfill gas recovery for energy production.

To align with the country's ""dual carbon"" target to achieve the peak of carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, the Government will continue to implement the four decarbonisation strategies, namely, net-zero electricity generation, energy saving and green buildings, green transport and waste reduction, outlined in Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, with a view to reducing Hong Kong's carbon emissions by half from the 2005 levels before 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.

Details of the 2024 GHG emission inventory have been uploaded to the Carbon Neutrality and Sustainable Development website (cnsd.gov.hk/en/climate-ready/ghg-emissions-and-trends)."

Latest figures of primary healthcare services provided by Health Bureau to residents affected by Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire,2026-01-22 10:00,2026-01-22 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012100608.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced earlier the medical support provided for residents affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. At present, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong serve as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The HHB announced today (January 22) the latest figures of these services:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1, 2025, (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow-up appointments and medication refill service points, from Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts. As of January 20, the DHCs hotlines across all 18 districts have received 363 enquiries in total.

Free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners and free denture replacement services

  The HHB introduced a free family doctor service scheme, free CM consultation services, and free denture replacement services on December 4, 15, and 23, 2025, respectively to support the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents until February 28 this year. Case managers of the DHCs will arrange for them to receive up to three free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners respectively based on their individual situations and preferences, covering the provision of medication and related treatments; and at least one free dental consultation and one follow-up appointment (subject to clinical need), covering denture replacement and oral treatment services.

  As of January 20, more than 300 private family doctors have participated in the free family doctor service scheme, covering more than 450 service points that include eight private hospitals. So far, 94 referrals have been handled. As for the free CM consultation services, more than 360 CM practitioners have participated, covering more than 620 service points, and 57 referrals have been handled so far. Regarding free denture replacement services, more than 110 private dentists have participated, covering over 150 service points, and 31 referrals have been handled so far.

HA's healthcare services

  All individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the HA will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation. A total of 79 patients received treatment at various public hospitals due to the fire. As of January 20, 71 of them had already recovered and were discharged, and the remaining eight are in stable condition. Healthcare staff will continue to provide appropriate treatment and care to these patients.

  Moreover, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31 this year. The waivers cover in-patient services, family medicine and specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs) services (including psychiatry SOPCs), accident and emergency services, day hospitals, day procedures, community services, and Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres under the HA. As of January 20, the HA has provided necessary healthcare services to around 1 900 affected residents.

Mental health support

  The 18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline immediately deployed additional staff and strengthened training for its call handlers on the day of the fire incident to cope with the emotional distress that the public may experience due to the incident. From the time of the incident to January 20, the hotline has received over 17 000 calls, 750 of which were related to the fire incident. The WhatsApp service has handled over 800 messages, with about 50 of them concerning the fire incident. The HA's 24-hour Mental Health Direct hotline, manned by psychiatric nurses, offers professional advice and support on mental health issues to callers, including provision of risk assessments and referrals to the HA's mental health services as appropriate.

陳茂波中午出席了「2026達沃斯‧財新CEO午餐會」並發表主題演講。餐會以「探尋有效增長之道」為主題，陳茂波向參與午餐會的嘉賓介紹了香港在過去一兩年所取得的穩健發展，以及未來在金融、貿易和創科三個主要增長引擎的發展願景和布局。

他特別指出，人工智能和區塊鏈等技術的突破正引發深刻的產業變革，驅動經濟增長和轉型，任何經濟體都必須擁抱這些發展；在「一國兩制」下，香港在金融和科技創新上正不斷探索和試驗，加上與鄰近粵港澳大灣區具備強大創科產業鏈的兄弟城市合作，具有相當大的發展潛力，值得投資。

他在演講中也指出，國際貿易正經歷範式轉移，發達國家需意識到部分發展中國家過去主要以製造和輸出廉價產品的發展模式正在改變。以中國為例，國家推進高水平雙向對外開放，並以擴大內需作為經濟發展的主要動力，這一方面將持續為中國經濟的高質量發展注入動能，同時也為不同經濟體的優質產品和服務提供龐大巿場機遇，繼續共同繁榮。

此外，陳茂波晚上出席以聚焦中國發展為主題的晚餐會並發表演講，分享對國家發展、國際關係，以及香港和內地資本市場發展的看法。

陳茂波今日（達沃斯時間一月二十二日）將繼續當地的訪問行程。"
FS promotes Hong Kong's advantages to global leaders in Switzerland (with photos/video),2026-01-22 09:00,2026-01-22 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012200132.htm,"​The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, continued his visit to Davos, Switzerland, yesterday (January 21, Davos time) to attend activities of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting. He participated in multiple luncheons and networking sessions, and met with officials and business leaders from various regions to promote Hong Kong's advantages.

At noon, Mr Chan attended the ""2026 Davos-Caixin CEO Luncheon"" themed ""Beyond Old Models: Designing Growth That Works"" and delivered a keynote speech. In his speech, Mr Chan introduced the steady progress Hong Kong has made over the past year or two, and shared the city's development vision and strategic positioning in its three key growth engines — finance, trade as well as innovation and technology.

He highlighted that breakthroughs in technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain are driving profound industrial transformation and economic growth. All economies must embrace these developments. Under the ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is actively exploring and piloting initiatives in financial and technological innovation. With strong collaboration with neighbouring cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area that boast robust innovation and technology industrial chains, Hong Kong holds tremendous development potential and is a worthwhile investment destination.

Mr Chan also pointed out that international trade is undergoing a paradigm shift. Developed countries must be aware that the traditional development model of producing and exporting low-cost goods, previously dominant among developing economies, is evolving. Taking China as an example, the country is advancing high-level, two-way opening-up and driving its economy with a focus on expanding domestic demand. This not only injects momentum into China's high-quality development, but also creates vast market opportunities for quality goods and services from across the globe, fostering shared prosperity.

In the evening, Mr Chan attended a dinner themed ""China in Focus"" and delivered a speech sharing his views on China's development, international relations, as well as capital market developments in both the Mainland and Hong Kong.

Earlier in the day, Mr Chan also attended a business exchange session of the WEF Annual Meeting, where he interacted with nearly 100 leaders from various sectors and regions. The discussion covered topics such as the outlook for the United States and global economies, strategies to enhance economic resilience, and ways to promote growth.

Meanwhile, Mr Chan also held bilateral meetings with the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia, Mr Sun Chanthol, and the Minister of State for Financial Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Mr Mohamed bin Hadi Al Hussaini. They exchanged views on the global economic and trade landscape and matters of mutual interest, and explored ways to strengthen bilateral economic and trade co-operation. Mr Chan also met with the Chairlady and Founder of medical technology company Yidu Tech, Ms Gong Yingying, yesterday to learn about the development of its AI and digital-powered clinical platform. He encouraged the company to consider expanding its business to Hong Kong.

Mr Chan will continue his visit in Davos today (January 22, Davos time)."

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-22 06:45,2026-01-22 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012100711.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十二日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

Employers and employees should take precautions during cold weather,2026-01-22 06:45,2026-01-22 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012100701.htm,"Attention duty announcers, radio and TV stations:

Please broadcast the following special announcement immediately, and repeat it at frequent intervals when the Cold Weather Warning is in force:

  The Labour Department reminds employers that as the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions such as reminding employees who have to work outdoors or in remote areas to wear appropriately warm clothing, and make arrangements for employees to rotate from outdoor to indoor or sheltered work sites as far as possible. Employees should take note of the weather report, wear appropriately warm clothing and be mindful of their health conditions. They should notify their supervisors and seek medical help immediately if feeling unwell, such as having cold limbs and body shivering."
CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-22 06:45,2026-01-22 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/22/P2026012100721.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 22) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

 The public may also call Dial-a-Weather (1878 200) or visit thewebsite of the Hong Kong Observatoryfor the latest weather information and forecasts, or itspage on Weather Information for Senior Citizens."

非常感謝林筱魯議員的議案及李鎮強議員和陳文宜議員修正的議案，還有其他今日很多位議員的發言，多謝你們關心香港長者住屋情況，亦提供了很多的寶貴意見。我會就今日聽到的意見作綜合回應和一些補充。

很多議員提及興建長者公寓、長者社區，為提供長者住宿單位，提供集居住、康樂設施與醫療護理於一身的居所。

事實上，房協（香港房屋協會）在這方面正正做了很多探討，在他們的先導項目中做了很多不同的模式。這些模式不單是樓宇的設計，還有是關乎按揭、財務安排、租務安排等。這些跟房委會（香港房屋委員會）所做的是相輔相成，很有意義，提供更多不同的答案，更多落地可行的做法。無論是帶動私人市場，或是在設計方面都可以有更多的選擇。

未來，我們都會在這方面繼續和房協一起做多些功夫。例如，房協的「長者安居樂」住屋計劃，就是用一個終身租住的模式營運，為年滿60歲的中等收入人士提供居集居住、康樂設施與醫療護理於一身的居所。目前已落成入住的三個「長者安居樂」項目，分別為將軍澳的樂頤居、牛頭角的彩頤居，以及紅磡的豐頤居，合共提供888個長者友善單位。有意見希望未來社會可以加大、更多這些可能性，或在私人市場看到這些模式是實際可行，或可以怎樣優化以配合市場運作，這個我們希望未來房協可以繼續這方面的工作。下一個位於粉嶺百和路的項目亦已經落成，將提供約260個單位。房協在乙明邨亦以新的建築方法，以「組裝合成」建築法興建長者住屋項目，叫「松悅樓」，提供了64個長者友善的單位，給一些出租的全長者寬敞戶申請。一些非資助性的項目，更加接近私人樓宇的模式，就是北角丹拿山的「雋悅」。

房委會和房協，我們怎樣去大家互相探討不同的範疇呢？在房委會方面，我們希望在我們的屋邨多點「居家安老」、「跨代共融」的模式。因為有些長者可能喜歡在比較集中的地方，多點醫療配套的地方安老，但有長者又喜歡在原本住了很久的地方居住，令到老中青幼都可以在社區裏共享一個幸福的設計。所以一些通用設計在未來的屋邨是很重要的，讓不同人士可以一起建立長者和諧的社區關係。

要建立共融社會，整體和長遠來說，劃分一些房屋或社區讓長者居住，很多長者很想用這個型式。但是，另外一些長者則希望在日常生活、出入時仍然可以見到很多小朋友、年輕人，大家閒話家常是很開心的事。所以房協和房委會，大家在不同的範疇裏一起努力，例如，房委會會把一些長者友善的元素融入房屋項目中，凝聚不同年齡的居民。房協亦有一個新想法，就是加入一些「可改動設計」，即是當一戶人一直住、直至年紀大的時候，有些設計可以改動以配合需要，例如煮飯的地方，有些位置可以改動廚櫃，令到他需要坐輪椅的時候，可以方便出入廚房。這些都是很有價值，可以說是設計的實驗。專門為長者建造的住屋項目或其他不同的模式，將居家安老的設計融入更多住宅項目，配合社會老齡化的需要，提升住戶的幸福感，在地做多點不同的設計，這個是我們未來的心意和願望。

我們重申，希望房委會和房協結合起來探討不同的模式。由小設計，到整個大廈的管理，或者是一些租住模式、財務安排，這些都希望可以在私人市場提供更多不同的選擇，亦都可以帶動私人市場的思考。可能他們見到原來這些新的設計都不是那麼貴，自然已經吸納在本身的樓宇裏，或者有些需要政府有更多的誘因帶動的，或者有些變成法例，規定一定要做，這些都是我們未來可以繼續探討的方向。

除了硬件設計，我們都聽到，軟件服務亦很重要，長者亦希望能夠更集中，以「中心為本」，的社區照顧模式。所以在公營房屋的規劃，或者將來北都的房屋規劃，我們會繼續配合不同的政策，提供一些福利設施。我們會繼續諮詢不同的部門、機構、社會福利署的意見，提供合適數量和種類的福利設施，例如長者鄰舍中心、日間護理中心等。

生活的設備是很重要的，舉幾個例子，剛才有議員都有提到，升降機真是能夠便利長者，以前可能一些舊的屋邨，或者香港的地理環境，很多都在一些山坡，高高低低。以往可能都是靠行樓梯，但隨着高齡化的社會來臨，一些依山而建的屋邨我們都開始探討。所以於二○○八年開始我們已經推行了很多加裝升降機計劃，至今已有33個公共屋邨加裝了85部升降機、還有很多自動電梯、行人天橋等，這些做法，希望我們可以在一些比較難加升降機的情況，譬如剛才有議員提到，可能我們要用樓梯機，甚至一些不是固定安裝的樓梯機，是有需要時候去租，靈活給物管使用，這些我們都會探討。這些也帶動了私人市場，希望有更多這些服務公司，給予他們生意的時候，在私人市場裏亦可以服務一些舊樓的業主。

有議員提及一些很細緻的，例如大門的密碼，還要長者拿着很多餸菜按鍵是不方便。這個希望很快大家都會聽到，我們都會試驗一些智能出入門咭。我們希望先選一些先導項目，然後再推廣至不同屋邨。所以大家看到我們無論是整體的規劃設計到很細緻的，我們未來都會不斷努力的。

到內地大灣區養老也是剛才有很多議員提及過的。我們都明白，也留意到近年很多公屋長者會選擇到內地灣區養老，是一個趨勢。移居內地後可能他們有時會擔心會不會有適應問題，為加強支援他們在粵閩兩地養老的一些長者的需要，房委會容許參加社會福利署「可攜社會保障計劃」的長者住戶，保留其原有的公屋單位，是他原本住的公屋單位，我們讓他保留不超過六個月，以往是三個月，現在延長了，給長些時間他嘗試適應。我們亦有一個機制，發出一張俗稱「回頭紙」的保證書，即是說如果將來他已交回公屋單位或刪除公屋戶籍的受助人，在符合一定資格和資源許可的情況下，如果他要回來的時候，拿着這張「回頭紙」可以重新獲編配公屋單位或恢復戶籍。

「逆按揭」亦有相當多議員提及過，在「逆按揭」方面要多推廣，或在現行的「逆按揭」裏有沒有空間再優化樓宇的年齡等。我們在未來日子都會和財經事務及庫務局、金管局（香港金融管理局）等機構多作探討。

其實今日的討論，有很多是關乎私樓的。私樓方面亦有關乎有很多不同的政策局，例如發展局、醫衞局（醫務衞生局）等。在一些醫療衞生配套或社福配套，今日都有很多的建議。我相信在照顧老人家這個範疇，事實上有很多跨政策局的合作。在未來的日子，我會和不同的政策局細心聆聽和消化，吸收大家今日的意見。

主席，我們明白大部分長者希望可以留在自己喜歡和熟悉的環境和社區生活、安老。因此，令我們的社區環境更長者友善，加入更多無障礙的設計，培養正面的跨代關係，更多的「以人為本」、貼心的服務支援，是非常重要的。締造長者友善生活環境這個課題需要全方位、跨政策和跨部門的合作。每一個人都會老，未來我們會與相關部門一起努力，多聽社會的意見，用心為我們的「老友記」服務。

多謝主席。"
立法會：政制及內地事務局局長就「制訂香港特區發展願景，主動對接國家『十五五』規劃」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-21 20:00,2026-01-21 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100557.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上就嚴剛議員動議的「制訂香港特區發展願景，主動對接國家『十五五』規劃」議案的開場發言︰

主席：

中共二十屆四中全會在去年十月二十三日審議通過了《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》（「十五五」規劃建議）。「十五五」規劃建議為國家未來五年發展作出了頂層設計、戰略擘畫，不但總結了「十四五」時期國家發展所取得的重大成就，更明確了「十五五」時期，即二○二六年至二○三○年間，國家經濟社會發展的指導思想、主要目標和重大舉措。「十五五」規劃建議提出「十五五」時期經濟社會發展的主要目標，包括為高質量發展取得顯著成效、科技自立自強水平大幅提高、進一步全面深化改革取得新突破、社會文明程度明顯提升、人民生活品質不斷提高、美麗中國建設取得新的重大進展，以及國家安全屏障更加穩固。在以上基礎上再奮鬥五年，到二○三五年實現我國經濟實力、科技實力、國防實力、綜合國力和國際影響力大幅提升，人均國內生產總值達到中等發達國家水平，人民生活更加幸福美好，基本實現社會主義現代化。

在「一國兩制」下，香港特區享有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢和重要作用，在推進國家強國建設中一直扮演重要角色。從一九九六年的「九五」規劃綱要首次提及港澳，到二○二一年「十四五」規劃綱要中的「港澳專章」，香港在國家規劃中的地位不斷提升。過去幾年，在國家的大力支持、特區政府全力推動、香港各界的不懈努力下，香港已成為首屈一指的國際金融中心、航運中心、貿易中心。香港更是位居全球第三、亞太區第一的國際金融中心。香港在其他國際報告中排名亦屢創新高，包括全球競爭力上升四位至世界第三、人才競爭力兩年共上升12位至世界第四，安全城市排名躋身十大。

「十五五」規劃建議為香港賦予了新的戰略內涵——鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」，即國際金融、航運、貿易和創新科技中心，以及國際高端人才集聚高地。正如國家主席習近平一再強調，香港融入和服務國家發展大局是「一國兩制」的應有之義，也是特區未來發展的新路向、新空間、新動能的關鍵所在。我們必須要繼續善用「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，發揮好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色，全面推進金融、創科發展雙引擎建設，不斷深化國際交往合作。

現時，特區政府各個政策局及部門正積極就十五五規劃建議的內容作深入研究。待「十五五」規劃綱要於今年三月全國人大通過後，我們會積極主動做好各項具體對接的工作，以促成香港的全面發展，同時助力國家的高質量發展和高水平對外開放，推進國家強國建設、開創民族復興偉業新局面。

接下來，我和我的同事會細心聆聽各位議員的寶貴意見，共同交流如何將主動對接「十五五」規劃的工作做得更紮實、更高效。我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
LCQ9: Supporting Hong Kong residents and enterprises pursuing development in Mainland,2026-01-21 19:58,2026-01-21 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100553.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Maggie Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

 The Mainland offices and liaison units of the Government (the Mainland offices) have been actively promoting Hong Kong's strengths, promoting exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong and the Mainland, as well as supporting Hong Kong people and enterprises to integrate into the overall development of the country. There are views that the Mainland offices can further leverage the role as an important bridge for ""going global and attracting external investment"" in promoting Hong Kong to align with the national 15th Five-Year Plan in a more proactive manner. On supporting Hong Kong residents and enterprises pursuing development in the Mainland, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views pointing out that the Mainland offices are serving cities diverse in their characteristics, so that they have their own focus on work priorities, whether the Government has plans to formulate overall targets and establish a cross-office coordination mechanism for the Mainland offices with a view to coordinating resources more effectively as well as defining the overall service and support directions of the Mainland offices; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as the 2025 Policy Address has indicated that the Government will encourage Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas, whether the Government has plans to organise Hong Kong enterprises pursuing development in the Mainland to join forces with Mainland enterprises in tapping new markets, so as to make ""Hong Kong Brands"" shine in the Mainland and overseas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as it is learnt that the Mainland offices currently promote Hong Kong's strengths and support Hong Kong people and enterprises in the Mainland through measures such as disseminating information, organising thematic activities, promoting youth exchange, and maintaining communication and liaison with the Mainland authorities, whether the Government has plans to introduce more proactive and targeted support policies apart from the aforesaid measures; if so, of the details (including the relevant performance indicators); if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) whether the Government has plans to enhance the support for associations of Hong Kong residents and chambers of Hong Kong enterprises in the Mainland, and further strengthen the liaison with associations of Hong Kong residents and chambers of Hong Kong enterprises in the Mainland through the associations of Hong Kong residents in the Mainland sector, such as collecting views regularly, organising thematic exchanges, as well as proactively paying attention to the difficulties of Hong Kong people and enterprises in the Mainland and assisting them in resolving such difficulties; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 After consulting the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the consolidated response to the Hon Maggie Chan's question is as follows:

(1) The major responsibilities of the Mainland Offices of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government (the Mainland Offices) include enhancing liaison and communication between Hong Kong and the Central People's Government as well as the provincial and municipal governments on the Mainland to promote exchange and co-operation; telling Hong Kong's good stories on the Mainland to promote the unique characteristics of Hong Kong as well as the investment opportunities and business advantages under the national development plan and development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, so as to encourage and attract Mainland enterprises and talents to establish presence in Hong Kong; fostering youth and cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland; providing information and other appropriate support and assistance to Hong Kong residents and enterprises on the Mainland, etc.

 As for the above tasks, the Mainland Offices have set annual key performance indicators which would be published in the Policy Address and the Budget. For 2026, the Mainland Offices will organise no less than 3 400 visits to Mainland authorities or bodies, attending no less than 290 speaking occasions, conducting no less than 350 media interviews or briefings, and participating in no less than 880 business and trade meetings.

 The Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, as the policy bureau of the HKSAR Government responsible for Mainland affairs, will oversee, coordinate and direct the Mainland Offices to effectively discharge their duties to ensure that they operate efficiently, and execute their work plans and provide a wide range of services in accordance with the targets.

(2) The 2025 Policy Address proposed to establish a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong's overseas offices, including those under InvestHK and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), as well as the Mainland Offices, and set up the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (Task Force) to encourage Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas. The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development is overseeing the work of the Task Force and coordinating with various bureaux, departments and agencies in formulating proposals for enterprises looking to go global. The Task Force will also organise various investment promotion activities across mainland provinces and municipalities to promote Hong Kong's unique advantages, and to identify and attract mainland enterprises looking to go global to set up operations in Hong Kong. When they expand their business abroad in future, these enterprises can benefit from the Government's ""Economic and Trade Express"" under which they will be better supported for overseas business missions and business matching activities through enhancement of collaboration among the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices in the overseas, InvestHK and the HKTDC.

(3) In addition to the above-mentioned promotional measures, the Mainland Offices collaborate with other Hong Kong institutions, including the HKTDC and the Hong Kong Tourism Board, etc. to formulate tailored work plans which respond to new opportunities arising from the national development, as well as the characteristics and circumstances of individual province, municipality and autonomous region. The aim is to provide appropriate support and services to Hong Kong people and businesses on the Mainland, helping them better integrate into national development strategy and develop locally. The Mainland Offices will also promote Hong Kong's advantages and tell good stories of Hong Kong. For example, we collaborate with local governments, trade associations and Hong Kong chambers of commerce to organise different types of trade promotion events, cooperation and matching sessions, thematic seminars, study tours, experience-sharing forums and gatherings for Hong Kong businessmen. Hong Kong enterprises on the Mainland and Hong Kong businessmen interested in expanding into the Mainland market will be invited to actively participate in these activities, which will not only broaden their business networks but also provide them with opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of the latest developments, policies, and development opportunities in the region concerned.

(4) The Mainland Offices have all along been striving to establish and maintain close liaison with associations, chambers of commerce, enterprises and student groups of Hong Kong people in their service areas, and proactively understand the situation of Hong Kong people working, studying and living therein and the difficulties they encountered through various economic, trade and cultural exchange activities being held from time to time. The Mainland Offices will provide appropriate support and assistance to Hong Kong people having regard to the actual situation and need, and reflect their demands to the relevant Mainland authorities. To assist Hong Kong people to better adapt to local life, the Mainland Offices have also compiled booklets of practical information on everyday life, with electronic version published on their websites and social media platforms, and provide Hong Kong residents on the Mainland with information on the latest Mainland laws and regulations, policies, major regional developments, etc. In addition, through the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development Promotion Centre located in Guangzhou, the Mainland Offices promote Greater Bay Area opportunities to Hong Kong residents and businesses developing in the Greater Bay Area cities on the Mainland and provide various practical assistance.

 Furthermore, the HKTDC visits Hong Kong enterprises on the Mainland from time to time to understand their business development needs and operational challenges, and organises relevant thematic events to provide them with trade and business support. The HKTDC has also launched the ""GoGBA one-stop platform"" and the ""GoGBA"" digital information platform to provide the business community with the latest information on the ""9+2"" city cluster of the Greater Bay Area, including policies, markets, industries, funding opportunities, and the latest developments in individual Bay Area city. A network of ""GoGBA Business Support Centres"" has also been established across all Greater Bay Area cities. In particular, the ""GoGBA Business Support Centre"" located in the concourse of Shenzhen Futian High-Speed Rail Station is jointly set up by the HKTDC, the People's Government of Futian District, Shenzhen and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce in Guangdong."

問題：

政府駐內地辦事處及聯絡處（駐內地辦）一直積極推廣香港優勢、推進香港與內地的交流合作，並支援港人港企融入國家發展大局。有意見認為，駐內地辦可在推動香港更主動對接國家「十五五」規劃方面，進一步發揮「引進來、走出去」的重要橋樑作用。關於支援在內地發展的香港居民和企業，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見指出，各駐內地辦所服務城市具不同特色，因此在工作重點上也各有側重，為更有效統籌資源並明確駐內地辦的整體服務支援方向，政府有否計劃為駐內地辦制訂整體目標及跨辦事處的協調機制；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）鑑於《2025年施政報告》表示，政府會主動招攬內地企業利用香港平台「出海」，政府有否計劃組織在內地發展的港企與內地企業共同「併船出海」，以在海內外擦亮「香港品牌」；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

答覆：

主席：

就陳曼琪議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局後，現綜合回應如下：

（一）香港特區政府駐內地辦事處（駐內地辦事處）的主要職能，包括促進香港與中央政府、內地各省、市、自治區政府的聯繫和溝通，推動交流合作；在內地說好香港故事，推廣香港特色，以及香港在國家整體發展規劃和粵港澳大灣區建設下的投資機遇及營商優勢，鼓勵和吸引內地企業和人才落戶香港；促進香港與內地的青年及文化交流；為在內地的港人港商提供資訊及其他適當支援和協助等。

因應上述工作，駐內地辦事處已訂立年度的關鍵績效指標，並於年度《施政報告》及《財政預算案》中公布。就二○二六年而言，駐內地辦事處會造訪內地機關或組織不少於3 400次、出席活動發表演說不少於290次、接受傳媒訪問或舉行簡報會不少於350次、以及參加商貿會議不少於880次。

政制及內地事務局作為特區政府負責內地事務的政策局，會統籌、協調及指導各駐內地辦事處有效執行各相關工作，確保辦事處有效運作，並按目標推行各項工作計劃和提供各式服務。

（二）二○二五年《施政報告》提出整合香港的外地辦事處，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局（貿發局）和駐內地辦事處，組成一站式平台，成立「內地企業出海專班」（專班），主動招攬在內地的企業善用香港平台「出海」。商務及經濟發展局局長正督導專班工作及協調各政策局、部門和機構，為「出海」企業制訂多元方案。專班亦會在內地各省市舉辦不同類型的投資推廣活動，宣傳香港的獨特優勢，物色並吸引有需要「出海」的內地企業落戶香港。這些落戶香港的內地企業日後到海外發展業務時，可受惠於特區政府設立的「經貿一站通」平台，即透過海外經濟貿易辦事處、投資推廣署及貿發局加強協作以支援它們進行海外商務考察及配對工作。

（三）除題述的各項推廣措施外，各駐內地辦事處亦會夥拍其他香港機構包括貿發局、旅遊發展局等，因應國家整體發展策略所帶來的新機遇，以及各省、市、自治區本身的特點及情況，因地制宜地制訂合適的工作計劃，為在內地的港人、港商提供適切的支援和服務，支持他們更好融入國家發展大局和在當地發展，以及在當地推廣香港的優勢，說好香港故事。例如，我們會與當地政府部門、商貿協會和香港商會合作，共同舉辦各式商貿推廣活動、合作對接會、主題研討會、考察團、經驗交流會、港商聚會等，並邀請內地港企和有意開拓內地市場的港商積極參與。有關活動不但可以擴闊商網，還可進一步了解當地的最新發展情況和各項政策措施以及發展機遇。

（四）各駐內地辦事處一直致力與駐地的港人組織、商會、企業和學生團體等建立和保持緊密聯繫，並通過不時舉辦的各類經貿文化交流活動主動了解港人在當地工作、學習和生活的情況以及所遇到的困難。駐內地辦事處會按實際情況和需要為港人提供適切的支援和協助，並就他們的訴求向內地相關部門作出反映。為協助港人更好地適應當地生活，駐內地辦事處又已編製實用生活資訊小冊子，同時以電子版本在辦事處網站及社交媒體上發布，並向內地港人提供有關內地最新法律法規、政策及重大區域發展等的資訊。另外，駐內地辦事處又透過設於廣州的粵港澳大灣區發展推廣中心，向在大灣區內地城市發展的香港居民和企業推廣大灣區機遇，並提供各種實務性的協助。

此外，貿發局亦不時拜訪內地港企，了解其業務發展需要及營運挑戰，並舉辦合適的主題活動，提供商貿支援。同時，貿發局又推出了「GoGBA一站式平台」和「GoGBA灣區經貿通」數碼資訊平台，為商界提供大灣區「9+2」城市群的最新資訊，包括政策、市場、產業、資助，以至各灣區城市的最新發展，並在各灣區城市建立了「GoGBA港商服務站」網絡，其中位於深圳福田高鐵站大堂的「GoGBA港商服務站」更是由貿發局、深圳市福田區人民政府和廣東省香港商會共同建立。"

（三）政府除了每年透過《施政報告》制訂一年期的政策規劃外，會否主動對接國家的規劃部署，長遠制訂「五年規劃」，以配合國家的宏觀發展方向？

答覆：

主席：

就吳傑莊議員的提問，經諮詢創新科技及工業局及發展局後，現回覆如下：

（一）中共二十屆四中全會在去年十月審議通過了《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》（「十五五」規劃建議）。「十五五」規劃建議為國家未來五年發展作出頂層設計、戰略擘畫，全面部署了「十五五」時期的戰略任務和重大舉措，明確從產業發展、科技創新、國內市場、經濟體制、對外開放、鄉村振興、區域發展，到文化建設、民生保障、綠色發展、安全發展、國防建設等重點領域的思路和重點工作。這些戰略任務和重大舉措，在在都為香港的未來發展帶來了無限機遇，因此我們全港各界都必須要好好把握。舉例來說，在優化區域經濟布局方面，香港要深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設，更要與內地其他區域經濟加強聯動合作，互利共贏，相互促進；在國際合作方面，香港要繼續深化國際交往合作，吸引全球高端人才與資本，發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台作用；在綠色發展方面，要推進綠色金融與碳中和實踐，助力國家生態文明建設，同時促進本港環保產業發展。至於議員關注的創新科技發展方面，政府已於二○二二年公布《香港創新科技發展藍圖》。另外，河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）亦已在二○二五年十二月正式開幕。港深兩地會爭取試行專屬的跨境政策措施，讓人員、物資、資金、數據等重要創新要素在河套區內便捷流動，致力成為國際先進科技創新規劃試驗區，開闢制度與政策創新的試驗田，以響應在「十五五」規劃建議中對高質量發展和科技自強自立的目標要求。由此可見，對接「十五五」規劃的工作是全方位、深層次和多領域的，可說是無遠弗屆。而「十五五」規劃建議亦為香港的發展作出了重要部署，提出鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」，即國際金融、航運、貿易和創新科技中心，以及國際高端人才集聚高地。這些部署既是香港未來長遠發展的方向和動能所在，同時亦切合國家的發展定位和有利國家的發展需要。正是以香港所長，服務國家所需。目前，特區政府各政策局及部門正積極深入研究如何在各自領域和範疇就「十五五」規劃建議作出主動對接。稍後待「十五五」規劃綱要草案在全國人大會議通過後，各政策局會全面推進相關對接工作。而行政長官領導的「融入國家發展大局督導組」亦會高層次、全方位地作出指導協調監督，以有效落實相關工作，務使特區全面對接「十五五」規劃，促成國家與香港共同的高質量發展。

（二）至於北部都會區（北都）的發展方面，北都是特區政府積極對接「十五五」規劃的重要舉措，更是引領香港未來經濟和社會發展的重要引擎，有助促進粵港澳大灣區的高質量發展。我們正全力推展北都，加快建設和引進產業。同時，如上所述，河套香港園區已於二○二五年十二月正式開園，創新科技及工業局亦已公布《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》，為新田科技城訂下清晰的發展方略。

發展局近日除了就北都首個「片區開發」項目展開招標外，亦正積極籌備「洪水橋產業園有限公司」於今年年中開始運作。發展局會於首季展開北都提速專屬法例的公開諮詢，近日亦已向業界及持份者介紹加快北都私人項目審批的行政措施。特區政府會繼續通過「對接北部都會區發展策略專班」，與深圳方面就北都的發展作緊密溝通，雙方共同磋商跨境發展建設的相關事宜。

（三）特區政府極為重視主動對接國家「五年規劃」的工作。行政長官每年發表《施政報告》，向立法會及社會各界闡述政府未來一年推出的重大政策方向及具體舉措，當中的政策舉措是有其連貫性的，並高度對接國家的「五年規劃」。事實上，自「十四五」規劃頒布以來，每年的《施政報告》均有就如何鞏固提升香港「八大中心」的地位提出相關的政策措施。政府又不時就重要政策範疇制訂發展藍圖，體現中長遠的發展規劃，例如《香港創新科技發展藍圖》和《中醫藥發展藍圖》等。這些在在都顯示特區政府非常重視特區的長遠規劃發展，而政府設立「融入國家發展大局督導組」以督導「十四五」以至「十五五」規劃，本身就是全面對接國家「五年規劃」的成熟既定機制。

「十五五」規劃將為香港帶來無限的發展機遇，特區政府必定會帶領全港各界共同努力全面主動對接好「十五五」規劃，以促進國家與香港長遠的高質量發展，既融入同時又服務國家的發展大局，並為國家的強國建設和民族的偉大復興作出貢獻。

多謝主席。"
LCQ6: Alignment with country's development plans,2026-01-21 19:44,2026-01-21 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100561.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Johnny Ng and a reply by the Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan outline the country's development in the next five years and make special arrangements to promote long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific policy options to proactively align with the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan, including how to broaden economic development and growth, accelerate the development and application of innovation and technology, and expedite the upgrading of industry structures, so as to align with the country's development;

(2) as there are views that the Northern Metropolis will be crucial to Hong Kong's economic and innovation development during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, how the Government will strengthen co-operation between the Northern Metropolis and other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, such as formulating joint policies to promote division of work in development, streamlining the administration workflows, advancing infrastructure construction, and expediting the implementation of the Northern Metropolis Action Agenda and the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole, so as to align with the country's planning and development; and

(3) whether the Government will, apart from formulating one-year policy planning through the annual Policy Address, proactively align with the country's planning and arrangements and formulate ""five-year plans"" in the long run, so as to align with the country's macro development direction?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau (ITIB) and the Development Bureau (DEVB), our reply in response to the questions raised by Dr the Hon Johnny Ng is as follows:

(1) The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) deliberated and adopted the Recommendations of the CPC Central Committee for Formulating the 15th Five Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development (the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan) in October last year. The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan provide top-level design and strategic blueprint for the country’s development over the next five years, comprehensively devising the strategic tasks and major initiatives during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, and clarifying the approaches and key tasks in priority areas ranging from industrial development, technological innovation, domestic market, economic system, opening-up, rural revitalisation, and regional development, to cultural construction, safeguarding people's livelihoods, green development, safe development, and national defence. All of these strategic tasks and major initiatives will bring boundless opportunities for Hong Kong's future development, and therefore all sectors of Hong Kong society must seize them firmly. For example, in terms of improving regional economic structures, Hong Kong should deeply engage in the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, while strengthening interactive co-operation with other Mainland regional economies for mutual benefit, win-win results, and mutual advancement. In terms of international co-operation, Hong Kong should continue to deepen international exchanges and co-operation, attract global high-end talents and capital, and play its dual roles of assisting Mainland enterprises to ""go global"" and attracting overseas investment. In terms of green development, Hong Kong should promote green finance and carbon neutrality practices to support the country's ecological civilisation construction, while fostering the development of local environmental industries. As for the innovation and technology development that Member is concerned about, the Government announced the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint in 2022. In addition, the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone (the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park) officially opened in December 2025. Hong Kong and Shenzhen will strive for trial implementation of dedicated cross-boundary policy measures to facilitate the convenient flow of important innovation elements including personnel, materials, capital and data within the Loop, endeavouring to become a testing zone for new rules and innovation and cultivate a testing ground for institutional and policy innovation, in response to the goals and requirements for high-quality development as well as self-reliance and strength in science and technology in the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan. From the above, it can be seen that the work of aligning with the 15th Five-Year Plan is all-round, in-depth and multi-dimensional, covering extensive areas. The Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan also make important plans for Hong Kong's development, proposing to consolidate, enhance, build and develop the ""Four Centres and One Highland"", namely the international financial, shipping, trade and innovation and technology centres, as well as the highland of international top-tier talent. These plans not only represent the direction and driving force for Hong Kong's long-term development in the future, but also align with the country's development positioning and are conducive to the country's development needs, precisely leveraging Hong Kong's strengths to serve the country's needs. At present, policy bureaux and departments of the HKSAR Government are actively studying in-depth on how to proactively align with the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan in their respective scopes and purviews. After the draft outline of the 15th Five-Year Plan is adopted at the session of the National People's Congress later, the policy bureaux will take forward the relevant alignment work in full swing. The Steering Group on Integration into National Development led by the Chief Executive will also provide high-level, all-round guidance, co-ordination and supervision to effectively implement the relevant work, ensuring that the HKSAR fully aligns with the 15th Five-Year Plan and promotes high-quality development for both the country and Hong Kong.

(2) As regard the development of the Northern Metropolis (NM), it is an important measure taken by the HKSAR Government to actively align with the 15th Five-Year Plan, as well as an important engine driving Hong Kong's future economic and social development. It helps promote the high-quality development and foster more comprehensive co-operation of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We are moving full steam ahead to develop the NM, expedite the construction and attract industries. At the same time, as mentioned above, the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park already officially opened in December 2025, and the ITIB has also promulgated the Conceptual Outline of Development Plan for Innovation and Technology Industry in San Tin Technopole, setting a clear development strategy for the San Tin Technopole.

  Recently, in addition to launching the tender exercise for the first pilot area under the large-scale land disposal approach within the NM, DEVB is also actively preparing for the Hung Shui Kiu Industry Park Company Limited's commencement of operation in mid-2026. DEVB will conduct a public consultation on the dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of the NM in the first quarter, and has recently introduced to the industry and stakeholders the administrative measures to expedite approval of private projects within the NM. The HKSAR Government will continue to maintain close liaison with the Shenzhen side on matters relating to NM development through the Task Force for Collaboration on the NM Development Strategy. Both sides will conduct joint discussions on matters related to cross-boundary development and construction.

(3) The HKSAR Government attaches utmost importance to the work of proactively aligning with the country's ""Five-Year Plans"". The Chief Executive delivers the Policy Address annually, setting out to the Legislative Council and all sectors of the community the major policy directions and concrete measures to be launched by the Government in the coming year. These policy measures maintain consistency and are highly aligned with the national ""Five-Year Plans"". In fact, since the promulgation of the 14th Five-Year Plan, each year's Policy Address has included specific policy initiatives aimed at consolidating and strengthening Hong Kong's role as the ""eight centres"" outlined in the plan. The Government also formulates development blueprints from time to time for key policy areas, manifesting medium- to long-term development planning, such as the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint and the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint. All these demonstrate that the HKSAR Government attaches great importance to the long-term planning and development of the HKSAR. The establishment by the Government of the Steering Group on Integration into National Development to steer the 14th Five-Year Plan and the 15th Five-Year Plan is in itself a mature and established mechanism for comprehensively aligning with the country's ""Five-Year Plans"".

  The 15th Five-Year Plan will bring boundless development opportunities to Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government will certainly lead all sectors of Hong Kong society to work together to fully and proactively align with the 15th Five-Year Plan, so as to promote the long-term high-quality development of the country and Hong Kong, integrate into and at the same time serve the overall national development, and contribute to the country's building of a great country and the great rejuvenation of the nation.

  Thank you, President."

衞生署亦已將事件通報內地相關單位。

根據《預防及控制疾病規例》（第599A章），任何人輸入該人有理由懷疑含有傳染性病原體的任何排泄物、分泌物、血液或血液成分，必須提供衞生署的書面准許。違例者一經定罪，最高可被罰款五千元及監禁兩個月。

調查期間，衞生署發現兩間涉事的化驗所（「創新基因診斷實驗室有限公司」及「Zentrogene Bioscience Laboratory Limited」），在網上廣告中聲稱是「屬於香港衞生署認可的醫學化驗機構」，涉嫌誤導消費者。事實上，衞生署並無認可任何醫學化驗機構。此外，根據本署紀錄，另外兩間名為「香港諾華醫療」和「香港鉑雅醫療中心」的涉事機構並未根據《私營醫療機構條例》（第633章）提交診所牌照或小型執業診所豁免書申請，亦未根據《診療所條例》（第343章）註冊，其中「香港鉑雅醫療中心」自稱為「香港註冊醫療診所」。本署已就相關個案通報香港海關跟進，並已要求負責人移除所有誤導性陳述。

DH follows up on suspected illegal importation of blood samples for testing in Hong Kong,2026-01-21 19:00,2026-01-21 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100415.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) has recently received media enquiries concerning individuals who promote services on social media platforms that involve arranging blood draws for pregnant women on the Chinese Mainland and smuggling blood samples into Hong Kong for fetal gender testing. The DH today (January 21) stated that it has immediately followed up on the matter and referred relevant information regarding the two laboratories in question to the Medical Laboratory Technologists Board for appropriate actions against the registered Medical Laboratory Technologists concerned, in accordance with the Allied Health Professions Ordinance (Cap. 359). Under the Ordinance, no registered Medical Laboratory Technologist may perform tests for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment without a referral from a registered medical practitioner or other specified healthcare professional.

The DH has also notified the relevant Mainland authorities.

According to the Prevention and Control of Disease Regulation (Cap. 599A), any person who imports any excreta, secretion, blood or blood component that the person has reason to suspect contains an infectious agent should obtain prior written permission from the DH. The maximum penalty upon convictionis a fine of $5,000 and two months' imprisonment.

  Investigation by the DH revealed that the two laboratories involved - NovaGene Diagnostic Laboratory Limited and Zentrogene Bioscience Laboratory Limited - falsely claimed in online postings to be ""medical laboratories accredited by the DH"". This information is false and misleading, as the DH does not accredit any medical laboratories. Furthermore, DH records show that two other institutions, named ""Nova Medical"" and ""Hong Kong BOYA Medical Center"", have neither applied for clinic licences or letters of exemption for small practice clinics under the Private Healthcare Facilities Ordinance (Cap. 633), nor registered under the Medical Clinics Ordinance (Cap. 343). Despite this, ""Hong Kong BOYA Medical Center"" claimed to be a ""Hong Kong registered medical clinic"". The DH has referred these cases to the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department for follow-up and requested the removal of all misleading statements.

In addition, during the investigation, the DH found that advertisements for other services published on the websites of the relevant medical centres involved are suspected of breaching the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap. 231). The DH has issued warnings to the medical centres and ordered the immediate removal of the non-compliant advertisements.

The DH will continue to follow up on the matter seriously and take enforcement actions in accordance with the relevant regulations, in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, to safeguard public health."
立法會七題：推動與中東地區國家的交流合作,2026-01-21 18:50,2026-01-21 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100525.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上陳勇議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

據報政府正積極牽頭推動與中東地區國家的交流合作，包括籌備成立政府駐沙特阿拉伯利雅得的經濟貿易辦事處，而金融服務方面，香港交易及結算所有限公司亦於去年在利雅得設立海外辦事處。就此，政府可否告知本會：

答覆：

主席：

政府一直積極拓展包括中東地區在內的經貿網絡，以促進香港的長遠經濟發展。其中，政府已在二○二一年十月設立香港駐迪拜經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦），並正積極與沙特阿拉伯政府跟進在利雅得開設經貿辦的計劃，以加強香港與區內貿易夥伴的經貿關係。此外，投資推廣署於二○二四年七月在埃及開羅，以及在二○二五年一月在土耳其第三大城市伊茲密爾共開設兩間顧問辦事處，致力開拓中東新興市場。

另一方面，政府會繼續積極尋求與包括中東在內的經濟體締結自由貿易協定及投資協定。我們即將與卡塔爾簽訂促進和保護投資協定，以及正分別與沙特阿拉伯和埃及探討簽訂新投資協定。

就陳勇議員的提問，經諮詢教育局、財經事務及庫務局、創新科技及工業局、政府統計處後，現回覆如下：

（一）中東地區發展迅速、充滿潛力，是「一帶一路」倡議的其中一個重要節點。

近年，多個中東國家提出發展願景藍圖，以期在能源產業以外實現經濟多元化轉型，並積極推動產業發展，包括創新科技（創科）、金融、貿易、再生能源和智慧城市，而香港在當中不少領域具備優勢，可與相關中東國家的發展戰略對接、優勢互補，為香港創科、金融、以及其他專業服務公司和初創公司帶來大量商機。

因應中東地區正提速發展，不少龐大的基建項目正全速推進，需要更多元化資金來源及創新籌融資模式。香港同時匯聚海外和內地資本，提供豐富多元和創新的金融工具，加上優秀和經驗豐富的專業服務團隊，可助力中東的提速發展，並為自身開拓更大的發展空間。此外，中東地區正積極尋求分散風險，配合全球經濟重心東移的大趨勢。香港市場國際化同時與內地市場高效互聯，運作方式及規管環境與國際最佳標準無縫銜接，是他們實現多元資產配置及財資管理的理想平台。

有鑑於此，政府一直積極拓展中東市場及建立聯繫，讓來自世界各地的投資者和市場參與者更好了解和善用香港作為國際金融中心的優勢，並為他們提供多元化的金融產品和服務。

香港金融管理局（金管局）過去數年積極向中東國家推廣香港金融體系和市場優勢，以進一步加強與中東市場的合作。例如，金管局與阿拉伯聯合酋長國（阿聯酋）、沙特阿拉伯和卡塔爾等地的中央銀行舉行雙邊會議，並簽署諒解備忘錄，涵蓋金融基建發展、可持續金融、金融科技、市場互聯互通和伊斯蘭金融等範疇。其中，金管局與沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金簽署諒解備忘錄，並共同出資支持創設一項目標規模達10億美元的新投資基金，促進與香港和粵港澳大灣區有聯繫的企業在沙特阿拉伯當地發展。另外，金管局亦正推動銀行業（尤其是內地銀行）在港設立區域總部，利用香港優勢，輻射開拓東南亞和中東等地區市場，提供更全面的跨境金融方案。

我們亦積極透過不同渠道開拓海外資金，包括深化香港與中東地區資金的雙向流動。繼二○二三年亞洲首隻追蹤沙特阿拉伯市場的交易所買賣基金（ETF）在香港掛牌上市，兩隻追蹤香港股票指數的ETF於二○二四年在沙特交易所以聯接基金方式上市，有助吸納當地資金配置港股。此外，香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）已先後與沙特證交所集團和阿布扎比證券交易所簽訂了合作備忘錄，並將沙特交易所、阿布扎比證券交易所及杜拜金融市場納入認可交易所範圍，便利在該些市場上市的企業在香港第二上市。港交所亦在二○二五年於利雅得開設辦事處，進一步促進與中東地區的聯繫。

基於中東國家的潛力，香港一直致力發揮「一帶一路」功能平台的角色，加大力度深化與中東地區的合作。近年，兩地之間的官方交流及經貿活動不斷增加，香港的不同機構與中東地區「一帶一路」國家的相關單位簽訂多份合作備忘錄及協議。其中，行政長官分別於二○二三年二月率領代表團訪問沙特阿拉伯和阿聯酋，以及於二○二五年五月率團訪問卡塔爾和科威特，兩次外訪共促成72份合作備忘錄、協議及聲明，為香港與當地開創商貿、金融、創科、可持續發展、運輸與物流、農業和教育等領域的合作商機。這些備忘錄及協議有助促進香港與中東地區全方位多領域的合作共贏，為長遠合作締造更穩固根基，從而強化雙邊經貿關係，為香港經濟注入新動力。有關合作備忘錄及協議的例子包括：

（a）香港已與巴林、約旦、科威特、沙特阿拉伯、阿聯酋和卡塔爾簽訂全面性避免雙重課稅協定，讓投資者更有效評估其跨境經濟活動的潛在稅務負擔及避免雙重課稅，從而締造更有利的營商環境，促進雙邊貿易和投資；

（b）與科威特、阿聯酋及巴林簽訂促進和保護投資協定，以進一步加強相互投資保護、增強投資者信心和擴大雙邊投資流動；

（c）與巴林、沙特阿拉伯、阿聯酋及卡塔爾簽訂關於各自「認可經濟營運商計劃」的互認安排，加強兩地國際貨物安全，促進合法跨境貨物流通，以加強雙方企業在國際市場的競爭力；以及

（d）與沙特阿拉伯簽署有關基礎建設及建築的合作諒解備忘錄，加強在相關領域的資訊交流，為香港相關專業服務進入當地市場提供支持。

雙邊貿易方面，根據政府統計處的數據，二○二二年至二○二四年（註一）期間香港與中東（註二）之間的雙邊貿易總額（包括進口和整體出口額）臚列如下：

在二○二一年至二○二三年（註三）間，香港對中東的金融服務出口額佔香港金融服務出口總額的比例不足0.5%。政府統計處沒有備存香港對中東的科技產品出口額佔比的統計數字。

（二）作為二○二五年《施政報告》的措施，商務及經濟發展局已設立「經貿一站通」，讓海外經貿辦、投資推廣署及香港貿易發展局按所涵蓋的地區透過建立一站式平台加強協作，發揮互補優勢，三位一體地於外地推廣香港的經貿及投資工作。「經貿一站通」會聚焦支援中小企及初創企業，主動組織相關企業等進行海外商務考察，並提供一站式的支援服務（包括安排商貿配對和其他活動），協助港商於具潛力的海外市場包括中東尋找商機。在過程中，投資推廣署會物色當地企業來港與本地業界對接，促成更多企業在港投資及開設業務，從而帶動企業和投資雙向流動。

此外，「經貿一站通」亦會進行更多推廣香港經貿及投資相關的活動及工作，透過集合三者資源，提升活動的規模和效益。

（三）行政長官在二○二三年《施政報告》提出建設香港成為「國際教育樞紐，未來人才搖籃」，並在二○二四年《施政報告》強調要致力打造「留學香港」品牌。在二○二五年《施政報告》，行政長官進一步提出為向世界推廣香港專上教育，吸引優秀學生學者來港發展，成立由教育局局長擔任主席的「留學香港專班」，與大學教育資助委員會（教資會）、創新科技及工業局、香港人才服務辦公室、專上院校、海外經濟貿易辦事處、駐內地辦事處等加強聯動，加大推廣香港專上教育。

為支持大學加強推廣「留學香港」品牌的工作，促進香港成為國際專上教育樞紐，教資會在二○二五至二○二八三年期撥款約4,000萬元予八所教資會資助大學共同參與的大學校長會國際化小組，以參與和舉辦各項海外活動，並到訪不同地方（尤其中東地區）招收海外學生。各大學均已積極拓展在內地及海外的招生活動，參與個別地區的教育博覽，善用既有的海外網絡聯繫當地的商會和企業，並為有意來港就讀的家長及學生舉行座談會等。教育局通過上述活動加強宣傳包括「一帶一路獎學金」在內的各項政策措施，以期吸引更多學生來港就學。由二○二四／二五學年起，「一帶一路獎學金」每學年的名額亦已增加至150個。在二○二四／二五學年，教資會資助大學舉辦近200次海外招生活動，不少均以「一帶一路」國家為目標，包括阿聯酋、約旦及卡塔爾。

在吸引非本地（包括中東地區）學生方面，由二○二四／二五學年起，政府資助的專上院校非本地學生限額（適用於授課課程）已由相當於本地學生學額的20%提升一倍至40%。各資助大學積極善用放寬後的限額，招收更多非本地學生來港升學。在二○二四／二五學年，學生來自超過100個國家及地區，當中約100人來自中東地區。由二○二六／二七學年起，每所資助專上院校的非本地生自費就學人數上限，由相當於本地學額數目的40%增至50%；資助研究院研究課程的超額收生自資學額上限，亦由100%增至120%。

在與中東地區的專上院校簽訂交流協議方面，教資會一直鼓勵大學提供更多境外交流的學習機會，讓學生更了解國家發展大局及世界大勢。截至二○二四年十一月底，教資會資助大學與全球各地院校一共簽訂了超過2 600份學生交流協議，其中47份涉及中東地區。

在研究合作方面，教資會與研究資助局一直積極推動香港高等教育院校與海外機構加強國際科研協作，深化國際交流並進行更多具影響力的前沿研究，以進一步提升院校的研究基礎實力。截至二○二四年十一月底，教資會資助大學與中東地區院校／機構正在進行的研究合作項目超過50個，包括以色列、阿聯酋、土耳其、沙特阿拉伯等。

此外，在二○二二年底公布的《香港創新科技發展藍圖》提出的四大發展方向包括「積極融入國家發展大局，做好連通內地與世界的橋樑」。香港的三大創科園區（即香港科學園、數碼港及港深創新及科技園）一直積極與世界各地建立合作夥伴關係。上述園區公司分別在二○二三、二○二四和二○二五年與中東地區的創科機構（例如科研機構、創投基金及科技孵化器）簽訂兩份、四份和兩份合作協議／備忘錄，以促進交流合作，協助兩地創科企業於對方地區落戶。

展望未來，三大創科園區將繼續拓展在新興市場（包括中東地區）的創科合作網絡，率領創科企業參加當地論壇及峰會，展示香港創科實力，發揮香港作為連通內地與世界的橋樑角色及優勢。

LCQ7: Promoting exchanges and co-operation with countries in the Middle East region,2026-01-21 18:50,2026-01-21 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100524.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yung and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

 It has been reported that the Government is actively taking the lead in promoting exchanges and co-operation with countries in the Middle East region, including preparations for establishing an Economic and Trade Office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In terms of financial services, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited also established an overseas office in Riyadh last year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in recent years, Hong Kong has signed a number of Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with countries along the Belt and Road in the Middle East region, whether the Government has studied what structural changes the signing of these MOUs have brought to the bilateral trade relations between Hong Kong and these countries; whether it has assessed (i) how such changes affect the long-term co-operation potential between Hong Kong and these countries in industries that enjoy advantages, such as financial services and technology products, and (ii) the specific benefits such changes bring to Hong Kong's economic development; the year-on-year growth rates of bilateral trade between Hong Kong and countries in the Middle East region, as well as their import and export values over the past three years, and the respective proportions of such exports involving Hong Kong's financial services and technology products;

(2) whether consideration will be given to consolidating the layout and resources of Hong Kong overseas offices, such as co-locating the base of such organisations as Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council in the same office building or area in countries in the Middle East region, so that Hong Kong enterprises can benefit from the one-stop services coordinated across different departments/institutions when they explore these markets; and

(3) how the Government promotes co-operation between Hong Kong and institutions and scientific research institutes in countries in the Middle East region, and of the progress and achievements made throughout the co-operation between Hong Kong and institutions and scientific research institutes in these countries so far; over the past three years, (i) the number of exchange programmes organised by Hong Kong and the institutions in these countries, as well as the number of schools and students involved, and (ii) the number of co-operation agreements signed between Hong Kong and the scientific research institutes in these countries; what plans the Government will put in place this year to promote co-operation between Hong Kong and the higher education institutions and scientific research institutes in countries in the Middle East region, and the targets it expects to achieve?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been proactively expanding its economic and trade network, including that in the Middle East region, to promote the long-term economic development of Hong Kong.Among others, the Government established the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (ETO) in Dubai in October 2021, and is actively liaising with the Government of Saudi Arabia to pursue the establishment of another ETO in Riyadh with a view to strengthening Hong Kong's economic and trade relations with trading partners in the region.Moreover, Invest Hong Kong has established two new consultant offices in Cairo, Egypt in July 2024 and in Izmir, the third largest city in Türkiye in January 2025, thereby exploring the emerging market of the Middle East.

 In addition, the Government will continue to explore free trade agreements and investment promotion and protection agreements (IPPAs) with other economies including those in the Middle East. We will soon be signing an IPPA with Qatar and are exploring new ones with Saudi Arabia and Egypt respectively.

 In response to the Hon Chan Yung's question, after consulting the Education Bureau, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Innovation, Technology andIndustryBureau and the Census and Statistics Department, our reply is as follows:

(1) The Middle East region is rapidly developing and full of potential, making it one of the key links of the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI).

 In recent years, numerous Middle East countries have put forward their visionary development blueprints, with a view to driving economic diversification on top of the energy sector, and are actively advancing development in areas like innovation and technology (I&T), finance, trade, renewable energy and smart city. Hong Kong has competitive edge in many of these areas, and may align with the development strategies of relevant Middle East countries, achieve complementarity of strengths, and create tremendous opportunities for Hong Kong's I&T, financial services and other professional services sectors as well as the start-ups.

 Given that the Middle East region is accelerating its development, many of the key infrastructure projects are progressing at full speed, which calls for the need of more diversified funding sources and innovative financing models. With capitals coverage of both international and the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong offers diverse and innovative financial instruments, coupled with a pool of quality and experienced professional services, Hong Kong is also well positioned to assist in the acceleration of the Middle East's development while expanding the room for development for ourselves. Furthermore, the Middle East region is actively seeking to diversify risk, aligning with the global economic shift towards the East. Being internationalised and highly connected with the Chinese Mainland market, Hong Kong has market operations and regulatory standards that are seamlessly aligned with the best international practices. This has made us an ideal platform for diversified asset allocation and wealth management.

 In light of the above, the Government has been actively expanding the Middle East market and establishing connections to enable investors and market participants from around the world to better understand and leverage Hong Kong's strengths as an international financial centre, while providing them with a diverse range of financial products and services.

 Over the past few years, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been actively promoting Hong Kong's financial system and market advantages to the Middle East countries to further strengthen co-operation with the Middle East market. For example, the HKMA has held bilateral meetings with central banks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc, and signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) covering areas such as financial infrastructure development, sustainable finance, fintech, market connectivity, Islamic finance, etc. Among these, the HKMA signed an MOU with the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, anchoring a joint fund with target size of US$1 billion, to support the localisation of companies in Saudi Arabia connected to Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Besides, the HKMA has been encouraging the banking sector, especially banks on the Chinese Mainland, to establish regional headquarters in Hong Kong, where Hong Kong's strengths can help companies expand into markets such as Southeast Asia and the Middle East, thereby providing more comprehensive cross-boundary financial solutions.

 We also actively explore attracting overseas capital through various channels, including deepening the two-way flow of capital between Hong Kong and the Middle East region. Following the listing of Asia's first exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the Saudi Arabia market in Hong Kong in 2023, two ETFs tracking Hong Kong stock indices were listed on the Saudi Exchange in the form of feeder funds in 2024, which helps attract allocation of local capital to Hong Kong stocks. In addition, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) has successively signed MOUs with the Saudi Tadawul Group Holding Company and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, and incorporated the Saudi Exchange, the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and the Dubai Financial Market on its list of recognised exchanges to facilitate companies listed on these markets to secondary list in Hong Kong. The HKEX also opened an office in Riyadh in 2025 to further promote ties with the Middle East region.

 As the countries in Middle East is full of potential, Hong Kong is committed to giving full play of our role as the functional platform for the B&RI, and stepping up efforts to deepen co-operation with the Middle East region. In recent years, official exchanges, economic and trade activities between the two sides have been increasing, and various institutions in Hong Kong have signed a number of MOUs and agreements with relevant entities in the Belt and Road countries in the Middle East region. Notably, the Chief Executive (CE) led delegations to visit Saudi Arabia and the UAE in February 2023, and Qatar and Kuwait in May 2025 respectively. These visits resulted in a total of 72 MOUs, agreements and statements, creating co-operation and business opportunities for Hong Kong and the Middle East in areas including trade, finance, I&T, sustainable development, transport and logistics, agriculture and education, etc. The above MOUs and agreements are conducive in driving all-round, multi-field collaboration and bring mutual benefits to Hong Kong and the Middle East region, thereby laying a solid foundation for long-term co-operation, thus consolidating the bilateral commercial and economic relations, injecting new energy to Hong Kong's economy. The relevant examples of MOUs and agreements include:

(a) Hong Kong has signed Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements with Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, enabling investors to better assess their potential tax liabilities from cross‑border economic activities and enjoy avoidance of double taxation, thereby creating a more favourable business environment and promoting bilateral trade and investment;

(b) IPPAs were signed with Kuwait, the UAE and Bahrain to further strengthen mutual investment protection, enhance confidence of investors and expand bilateral investment flows;

(c) Mutual Recognition Arrangements on Authorized Economic Operator Programmes were signed with Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar to reinforce international cargo security while facilitating legitimate cross-boundary cargo movements of the two places, and strengthen the competitiveness of enterprises from both sides in the international market; and

(d) The MOU in relation to infrastructure and construction were signed with Saudi Arabia to enhance information exchange in the relevant fields and support Hong Kong's professional services to access the market.

 For bilateral trade, according to the statistics from the Census and Statistics Department, the value of bilateral trade in goods (including imports and total exports figures) between Hong Kong and the Middle East (Note 2) during the period of 2022 to 2024 (Note 1) are listed below:

*Value in HK$ million (US$ million)

 During 2021 to 2023 (Note 3), Hong Kong's exports of financial services to the Middle East accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of Hong Kong's total exports of financial services. On the other hand, there is no collected data by the Census and Statistics Department on the share of Hong Kong's exports of technological products to the Middle East.

(2) As a measure announced in the 2025 Policy Address (PA), the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau has set up the Economic and Trade Express which enables overseas ETOs, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to enhance collaboration within the region under their respective coverage through a one-stop platform, capitalising on their complementary advantages to promote Hong Kong's trade and investment abroad under the trio-coordinated approach. The Economic and Trade Express focuses on supporting small and medium enterprises and start-ups by proactively organising overseas business missions for relevant enterprises with one stop supporting services (including arrangement of business matching and other activities) to assist Hong Kong enterprises to explore business opportunities in overseas markets including the Middle East. Through this process, Invest Hong Kong will identify overseas enterprises to connect with Hong Kong's business sectors, facilitating more enterprises to invest and establish operations in Hong Kong, thereby promoting two-way flow of enterprises and investments.

 In addition, the Economic and Trade Express will conduct more trade and investment promotional activities and work by pooling the resources of the trio to enhance the scale and impact of such activities.

(3) In the 2023 PA, the CE announced the development of Hong Kong into an international education hub and a cradle for future talents, and in the 2024 PA, the CE emphasised that the Government strives to establish the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand. In the 2025 PA, the CE further announced the establishment of a dedicated Task Force on Study in Hong Kong under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Education in order to further promote Hong Kong's post-secondary education globally and to attract outstanding students and scholars to come to Hong Kong. The Task Force brings together the University Grants Committee (UGC), the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, the Hong Kong Talent Engage, post-secondary institutions, overseas ETOs, the Mainland Offices, etc for greater promotion of higher education in Hong Kong.

 To support universities' efforts in stepping up the promotion of the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand and to facilitate the development of Hong Kong into an international post-secondary education hub, the UGC has provided around $40 million to the Heads of Universities Committee's Standing Committee on Internationalisation, which involves the eight UGC-funded universities, in the 2025 to 2028 triennium for participating in and organising various activities outside Hong Kong, and for visiting different places (in particular the Middle East region) to recruit overseas students. Universities have actively expanded their recruitment activities on the Chinese Mainland and overseas, participating in education fairs in specific regions, leveraging existing overseas networks to connect with local chambers of commerce and enterprises, and organising seminars for parents and students who are interested in studying in Hong Kong, etc. Through these efforts, the Education Bureau has stepped up the promotion of various policy measures, including the Belt and Road Scholarship, to attract more students to study in Hong Kong. Starting from the 2024/25 academic year, the annual quota for the Belt and Road Scholarship has been increased to 150 places. In the 2024/25 academic year, the UGC-funded universities organised nearly 200 overseas recruitment activities, many of which targeted the Belt and Road countries, such as the UAE, Jordan and Qatar.

 In attracting non-local students (including those from the Middle East region), starting from the 2024/25 academic year, the admission quota for non-local students in publicly-funded post-secondary institutions (applicable to taught programmes) has doubled from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the local student places. The funded universities have actively made good use of the expanded quota to recruit more non-local students to pursue education in Hong Kong. In the 2024/25 academic year, these students were from around 100 countries and regions and among them, about 100 students were from the Middle East region. Starting from the 2026/27 academic year, the enrolment ceiling for self-financing non-local students of each funded post-secondary institution will be raised from the level currently equivalent to 40 per cent of the local student places to 50 per cent; and the over-enrolment ceiling of self-financing places of funded research postgraduate programmes will be increased from 100 per cent to 120 per cent.

 In signing exchange agreements with post-secondary institutions in the Middle East region, the UGC has all along been encouraging universities to provide more overseas exchange opportunities for students to gain a better understanding of national development and global trends. As of end November 2024, the UGC-funded universities signed a total of more than 2 600 student exchange agreements with institutions around the world, including 47 agreements with those in the Middle East region.

 With regard to research collaboration, the UGC and the Research Grants Council have been actively promoting stronger international research collaboration between local higher education institutions and overseas organisations, deepening international exchanges and conducting more impactful and cutting-edge research. Such efforts will help strengthen our research capacity. As at end November 2024, more than 50 ongoing research collaboration projects are being carried out by UGC-funded universities with institutions/organisations in the Middle East region, including Israel, the UAE, Türkiye and Saudi Arabia, etc.

 In addition, the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint promulgated in end-2022 set out four broad development directions, including ""to proactively integrate into the overall development of the country and consolidate our role as a bridge connecting the Chinese Mainland and the world"". Hong Kong's three major I&T parks (i.e. the Hong Kong Science Park, Cyberport and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen I&T Park), have all along been actively establishing partnerships around the world. The relevant park companies signed two, four and two collaboration agreements/MOUs with I&T institutions (e.g. research institutes, venture capital funds and technology incubators) in the Middle East region in 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively to foster exchange and collaboration, facilitating I&T enterprises from the two places to establish presence in each other's markets.

 Looking ahead, the three I&T parks will continue to expand their I&T collaboration network in emerging markets (including the Middle East region), and lead I&T enterprises to participate in forums and summits therein. This will showcase Hong Kong's I&T strengths, and further leverage Hong Kong's role and advantages as a bridge connecting the Chinese Mainland and the world.

Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 29, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (January 20), and seized 43 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $197,700 and a duty potential of about $144,800, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

立法會：房屋局局長就「推行長者房屋政策」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-21 18:30,2026-01-21 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100540.htm,"以下是房屋局局長何永賢今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上就林筱魯議員動議的「推行長者房屋政策」議案的開場發言：

主席：

非常感謝林筱魯議員今日提出的議案，及李鎮強議員和陳文宜議員的修正議案。

社會高齡化是全球大趨勢，香港也不例外。它所衍生的挑戰與機遇，橫跨多個政策範疇。為應對這些挑戰，行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》宣布成立社會高齡化對策工作組，由政務司副司長帶領各政策局制訂對策，涵蓋甚廣，包括安老、醫療、房屋、文化康樂、樂齡科技等範疇，目標在今年提交報告。

就林議員今天提出的議案，我會先介紹房屋局近年來積極打造宜居、共融及長者友善的生活環境所做的工作和成果，其後我會再綜合政府其他為達致「居家安老」這個一貫的安老政策的措施。

公營房屋

過去10年，居住在香港房屋委員會（房委會）公屋的60歲以上長者數目已經由54萬增加至74萬，多了20萬。提供更好的長者支援和更多的長者設施可以說是刻不容緩。

長者友善建築／屋邨設計

要達致「居家安老」，讓長者能夠在自己熟悉和有歸屬感的環境生活，房屋局和房委會一‍直秉承「關懷為本」的精神，積極探討便利長者住戶的措施。我們於二○二四年九月推出了「幸福設計」指引，該指引現已廣泛應用於多個新建屋邨及現有屋邨的改善工程。指引獲得多個境內、外的獎項，印證其創新與貢獻，包括大灣區城市設計大獎、香港規劃師學會周年大獎之銀獎、香港園境師學會年獎之優異獎等，更得到聯合國開發計劃署的報道和詳細介紹。

「幸福設計」提出八個幸福概念，當中兩個就正正是關於「樂齡安居」及「跨代共融」，為長者的需要確立了日常具體實用的設計依據。「樂齡安居」的概念着重於設計年齡友善的環境，例如於電梯內、大堂和走廊兩旁設計一些倚座、在長走廊加設扶手，增加一些清晰易明的圖像化標誌以提升方向辨識度等，不要看輕這些小小的設計改善，其實正正這些小改善可以鼓勵長者輕鬆出門，多與鄰里接觸。

「跨代共融」的概念則是創建多元共融的環境，建立能跨越幾代人的鄰里連結。例子包括在同一個休憩區設置長者康體設施，亦有兒童遊樂空間，讓爺爺嫲嫲到孫仔「老中青幼」都可在同一地方享用適合不同人士的設施。另外，房委會亦已為超過100條現有屋邨，額外增設長者康體設施及器材，供長者住戶作強身健體之用。我們在屋邨內的細節入手，引入這些以人為本的貼心設計，提供日常生活支援設施，點點滴滴地建立更多的歸屬感和幸福感。

屋邨單位內部設計

剛才提到的是屋邨小區層面的設計，而「通用設計」概念亦同樣適用於單位內部設計，讓長者能輕鬆在單位內生活，例如按住戶需要在單位入口設置斜道、擴闊浴室門口、在適當地面鋪設防滑地磚、將浴缸改為淋浴間、採用較大的開關掣和門鐘按鈕，並安裝在適合的高度、在浴室和走廊加設扶手等。如住戶只需要簡單調適，例如在浴室加裝扶手、改成淋浴間或更換推桿式水龍頭，只要通知我們，便可以直接為有需要的住戶免費安排相關工程。房委會亦會根據醫生、物理治療師或其他專業人士的意見，安排其他調適或改裝工程，務求令個別長者住戶的需要得到特別照顧。

關懷長者住戶

上述提到的是硬件方面的提升，更重要的是我們如何用心去關懷守護我們的長者。

積極關懷、主動探訪

首先，我們的前線屋邨管理人員是很重要的，他們會積極主動向長者提供到戶支援，主動上門、多探訪他們，尤其是對於非常高齡、很多90歲以上的長者住戶，我們更會增加探訪的次數；在日常管理中，前線人員亦會特別關注居於樓宇內的長者，如有需要，會主動聯絡相關社福機構提供協助。另外，我們亦會評估長者家居安全並優先安排免費的改善工程，或協助他們申請一些俗稱「平安鐘」的服務。我們會在日常管理中進一步實施強化關懷措施，例如轉介陪診、家居送餐服務等，以確保支援及時、恰當和持續到位。

每日人與人之間的接觸很重要，所以我們的物管團隊是非常重要的一環。為提升物業管理公司前線員工對長者關懷的意識，房委會亦已由去年底開始，在新的物業管理合約中增設支援長者的專項條款，明確要求物業管理公司必須參與社署（社會福利署）推行的「與照顧者同行」計劃，安排至少百分之二十的前線員工，包括物業管理主任和保安員，提供相關的培訓。我們會將參與培訓的員工比例要求逐步提升至百分之五十，讓前線人員學會一些待人處事的技巧，尤其是與長者溝通的技巧，以關懷為本、行動為實的精神去服務長者戶。

房屋署與社署亦在二○二五年六月開始以試點形式建立一個「對比機制」，將房屋署的住戶資料和社署的長者服務使用者資料作對比，以找出住在公屋而仍未接受長者支援或照顧服務的獨老或雙老住戶，然後委託關愛隊接觸及探訪這些住戶，向他們表達關愛及介紹服務例如「平安鐘」等。

社區服務和活動

在二○二六／二七年度，房委會的屋邨管理組會將支援長者納入重點項目，我們會以「邨『友』好事」，「友」是好朋友、「老友記」的「友」，作為年度主題計劃，資助屋邨舉辦跨代共融的社區服務及活動，並積極與不同政府部門及社會上的不同機構建立策略性合作計劃，務求將支援網絡擴展至全港屋邨。例如我們已主動接觸衞生署，於60個公共屋邨合作推廣一個名為「我好叻」的計劃，推廣健康飲食、經常運動及預防肥胖的信息，鼓勵長者培養健康生活習慣。剛才有議員亦提過，這些健康的生活習慣實在可以幫助我們節省很多醫療開支。

房屋署同時亦推動各屋邨與非政府機構、地區組織及企業的義工隊協作，在屋邨內提供流動健康檢查、醫療服務等。我們亦鼓勵更多居民成為義工，尤其剛才亦有議員說「青年老友記」，帶同他們的寵物一起來關心我們的屋邨長者，舉辦更多活動。房屋署邨管的前線團隊會持續協助各政府部門及機構配對服務對象、安排活動場地及協助推廣等，使各項活動能接觸更多長者，讓更多長者知道及配合他們的實際需要。

應用創新科技

未來科技應用，對於我們能更好地照顧長者真的很重要。房屋署已於二○二五年四月挑選了兩個長者居住人數較多的屋邨，即觀塘雲漢邨及何文田常樂邨，試行長者戶大門開關物聯網訊息系統，為自願參與的長者於單位大門安裝感測器，監測大門開關狀態，讓他們指定的親友掌握其出門的情況。若大門在選定的時間內未有開啓，系統會主動向其已登記的聯絡人發出手機提示信號，以便及時提供適切支援。房屋署會於二○二六年挑選另外兩條較多長者居住的公共屋邨，去進一步推展這項計劃，並會檢討成效及制定未來方向，或比對其他試行計劃，以回應長者社區日益增長的安全要求。

此外，房屋署亦會積極研究與其他社福機構及政府部門推行更多關懷長者計劃，例如房屋署已接觸長者安居協會，協助他們推展「一線通安全探測服務」試驗計劃，為約200戶獨居或雙老公屋、居屋長者戶，在室內安裝跌倒探測器，偵測跌倒或長時間無活動的緊急情況。探測器觸發後會自動連接24小時服務支援中心，職員會透過雙向通話確認長者情況；如無法確認安全，會立即通知長者指定的聯絡人，甚至報警求助。我們會繼續探討不同的樂齡科技，以強化長者居家安全。

住屋安排

在制定房屋政策方面，為配合長者的住屋需要及鼓勵年青的家庭照顧年長父母或親屬，房委會有多個針對長者優先編配公屋的安排，包括「共享頤年」、「天倫樂」及「高齡單身人士」優先配屋計劃。凡參加相關優先配屋計劃而符合資格的申請，通常會比一般家庭申請較早獲得處理。例如符合「天倫樂」優先配屋計劃的申請，可獲提早六個月處理。在過去的10年間，已有約七萬個家庭受惠於這些計劃。

房委會的資助出售單位亦推行「家有長者優先選樓計劃」，在銷售計劃預留百分之四十的新推售單位配額，予有60歲以上長者或有初生嬰兒的家庭優先選樓。「居屋2024」（「出售居者有其屋計劃單位2024」）及「綠置居2024」（「出售綠表置居計劃單位2024」），我們一共預留了近4 000個配額予以上兩個類別的家庭優先選購。

此外，房委會將推出「長者業主樓換樓計劃」，容許所有已登記的家庭成員如均年滿60歲或以上，並且擁有資助出售單位滿10年或以上的業主，可在未補價的情況下，於第二市場賣出原有單位後，再在第二市場購買一個面積較小或地區較偏遠的資助出售單位，讓合資格的長者業主選擇遷往更切合他們需要的單位後，可套現作為養老金。計劃細節預計將於今年內敲定，我們稍後會透過不同渠道向長者詳細解說。我們希望到時請各位立法會議員連同區議員和我們一起推廣有關計劃，令更多長者可以參與。

私人樓宇安排、關懷長者住戶

為了支援「居家安老」，由財政司副司長領導的「推動長者友善樓宇設計」工作組已完成制訂了一系列的方案，並已由二○二五年中起分批落實。

另外，要達致「居家安老」，需要多方面的社區安老服務和照顧支援的配合。為此，社署在全港設立215間長者地區中心和長者鄰舍中心，在地區層面為長者提供多項支援服務，並透過外展服務及社區網絡，識別有潛在服務需要的長者，並為他們提供適切援助。

總結

主席，大家可以見到政府，包括房屋局及其他很多政策局，都在多方面同心攜手，從不同層面關心和支援長者，目標是按他們的實際需要，打造一個宜居、共融及讓大家更有歸屬感的生活環境。現在我會細心聆聽各位議員的發言及提議，待會在總結時我會再作進一步的補充和回應。

多謝主席。"

立法會一題：推動數字教育,2026-01-21 17:30,2026-01-21 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100483.htm,"​以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上黃錦良議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

問題：

政府近年積極推動數字教育，致力促進教育創新。然而，有意見指出，目前本港學校在推動數字教育上的差異甚大，前線教師在運用數字科技進行教學的信心及能力也有參差。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去一個學年，當局為在職教師舉辦了多少個與數字教育相關的培訓課程；有否評估該等課程對提升教師在課堂上應用數字科技的成效；如有，評估機制及結果為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）有否計劃將人工智能列為教師持續專業發展的必修範疇，以及將數字教育能力，納入為教師專業發展及晉升的必要條件；如有，詳情及推行時間表為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）會否擴大數字教育卓越中心計劃，鼓勵具成功經驗的教師團隊到其他學校提供到校支援，協助前線教師將人工智能融入教學；如會，詳情為何；如否，有何其他措施促進校際經驗及資源分享？

答覆：

主席：

配合國家科教興國戰略，教育局於中小學推行多項措施，推動數字教育，支持教學創新，培育創科人才。要做好數字教育，教師的能力是關鍵。

就黃錦良議員的提問，重點回覆如下：

（一）為裝備教師迎接數字教育帶來的機遇與挑戰，教育局通過多元培訓，質量並重，持續推進教師專業發展。二○二四／二五學年和二○二五／二六學年，一共提供七萬多個名額，讓全港所有公帑資助學校教師都有機會參與培訓，為數字教育的實施奠定札實的專業基礎。

單在二○二四／二五學年，教育局推出一系列教師專業發展活動，舉辦了430多個數字教育培訓課程，提供超過三萬五千個培訓名額，同時亦組織主題活動，例如「智啟未來：人工智能發展探索」，設940個名額，讓教師通過專題講座及大灣區學習團，加深對人工智能技術和應用的理解，拓寛視野。另外又舉辦「善用人工智能促進小學課程發展」課程領導研討會，亦吸引了超過120所小學，近350名校長及教師參與，促進校際經驗交流及協作。

另外，由教育局成立的數字教育卓越中心（卓越中心），通過講座及到校支援，支持數字教育。卓越中心組織現職教師，分享數字教育的實踐，探討人工智能在教學上的應用，促進同儕學習。過去一年，中心提供超過200個教師培訓課程，超過一萬四千個培訓名額，近140次到校支援服務；又通過開放校園，進行教學示範及觀課，推廣成功的課堂應用。目前，卓越中心的支援服務，覆蓋超過九成公帑資助中小學，參與學校普遍都認同服務切合學校需要，有助提升教學效能。

就教師培訓的成效，教育局除了在培訓課程完成後進行問卷調查外，同時亦通過到校支援和觀課等，了解實施的情況，亦於二○二四／二五學年，向全港中小學進行「數字教育調查」，學校的回覆率近百分之九十二。調查結果顯示，超過九成半教師具信心使用電子工具以提升教學效能；能掌握使用電子工具以提升教學的精髓；並能運用各種電子工具以支援學生發揮創意及運用科技解決日常生活問題等。調查結果與平日的培訓數據相符，同時亦顯示教師應用數字教學已經具備一定的基礎。

（二）科技發展一日千里，社會對教師的期望亦日益提高，教師必須與時並進。持續專業發展，正是質素保證的關鍵。為此，教育局為教師訂定專業培訓框架，要求所有在職教師，每三年完成150小時的持續專業發展。在三年周期中，劃出不少於30小時參與有關「教師專業角色、價值觀及操守」及「本地、國家及國際教育議題」兩大範疇的核心培訓，其中，每範疇須最少六小時。培訓框架容許教師開放及靈活運用進修時數，以配合學校、學生及個人專業發展需要，選擇不同的活動和課程。人工智能及數字教育屬「本地、國家及國際教育議題」範疇，目前，學校可因應校情，制定校本持續專業發展計劃，協助教師達到培訓要求。

至於資助學校教師的晉升條件，除了需要符合《資助則例》有關的資歷要求外，亦須實行在晉升日期前五年內，完成指定的晉升培訓課程。核心培訓由教育局提供，現時已包括數字教育的內容；選修培訓則由教師按晉升崗位所需的專業知識修讀相關培訓。由於校情不同，晉升崗位所負責的專業職務亦不同，我們不建議設定劃一的硬性條件。

（三）未來，教育局會進一步擴大卓越中心的支援服務，組織更多借調教師，到學校提供支援服務。目前，資源學校的數目，由上一學年（二○二四／二五）的13所增至18所；借調教師由26位擴大至34位，支援項目由16項擴展至23項。支援重點除了推廣資訊素養、電子評估、運用資訊科技支援有特殊教育需要學生、提供混合模式學習等外，亦加入了更多人工智能元素，例如如何規劃人工智能於教學上的應用、人工智能於學與教及課程設計、人工智能與教育倫理等。

教育局亦會通過不同措施，鼓勵校際經驗交流及資源共享，包括加強校本專業支援服務，支援學校將數字教育工具，引入不同的學習領域或科目。另外，亦會通過「內地與香港教師交流及協作計劃」，推進跨地域的經驗交流觀摩，提升教師專業能力。

我們亦將陸續推出新一系列的人工智能（AI）專業培訓課程，內容涵蓋學校領導與教師所需的AI素養核心範疇，包括「AI素養課程」、「AI+科目課程」和「AI領導培訓課程」等，讓教師按教學及工作崗位需要，參加相關培訓。

事實上，由於校情不一，學校推行數字教育的幅度和速度均存在差異。教育局除了提供質量並重的教師培訓之外，亦鼓勵多元化的校本實踐，並通過不同的校本支援及校際交流分享活動等，促進經驗交流及資源共享，加快數字教育的發展步伐。

總而言之，教育局會建基現有優勢和基礎，透過多重進路，持續優化教師專業培訓和校本支援服務，配合數字教育最新發展，適時檢視成效，調整策略，裝備學校及教師應用創新科技輔助教學的能力，推動教學創新，提升學習效能。

多謝主席。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-21 17:30,2026-01-21 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100494.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月二十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
​
市民應採取的防預措施

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-21 17:30,2026-01-21 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100495.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 21), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
LCQ1: Promoting digital education,2026-01-21 17:30,2026-01-21 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100492.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Ken Wong and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

In recent years, the Government has actively promoted digital education with a view to fostering educational innovation. Nevertheless, there are views pointing out that considerable disparities currently exist among Hong Kong schools in promoting digital education, and that frontline teachers' confidence and capabilities in utilising digital technology in teaching also vary. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of training courses relating to digital education organised by the authorities for in-service teachers in the past academic year; whether the effectiveness of such courses in enhancing teachers' ability to apply digital technology in the classroom has been evaluated; if so, of the evaluation mechanism and the results thereof; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has plans to include artificial intelligence (AI) as a compulsory domain in teachers' continuing professional development, and to incorporate competence in digital education as a prerequisite for teachers' professional development and promotion; if so, of the details and implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it will expand the Digital Education Centre of Excellence Scheme to encourage teacher teams with successful experience to provide on-site support to other schools, so as to assist frontline teachers in integrating AI into teaching and learning; if so, of the details; if not, what alternative measures are in place to promote inter-school sharing of experience and resources?

Reply:

President,

To align with the national strategy of invigorating the country through science and education, the Education Bureau (EDB) has implemented various measures in primary and secondary schools to promote digital education, support teaching innovation and nuture innovative talent. The competence of teachers is key to the effective implementation of digital education.

​The reply to the question raised by the Hon Ken Wong is as follows:

(1) To equip teachers to embrace the opportunities and challenges brought by digital education, the EDB adopts a diversified training approach, emphasising both quality and quantity, to continuously advance teacher professional development. Across the 2024/25 and 2025/26 school year, over 70 000 training places will be provided, ensuring that all teachers in publicly-funded schools in Hong Kong have the opportunity to participate in training, thereby establishing a solid professional foundation for the implementation of digital education.
  
In the 2024/25 school year, the EDB has rolled out a series of teacher professional development activities, including organising over 430 digital education professional development programmes for teachers, offering more than 35 000 training places. The EDB has also organised a featured programme, ""AI Unleashed - Exploring the Depths for Educators"", providing 940 training places, enabling teachers to deepen their understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and its applications and broaden their horizons through thematic talks and a study tour to the Greater Bay Area. The curriculum leadership seminar organised by the EDB themed effective use of AI to promote curriculum developments in primary schools also attracted participation from over 120 primary schools with nearly 350 principals and teachers, fostering inter-school experience exchange and collaboration.
  
In addition, the Digital Education Centre of Excellence (CoE) established by the EDB promotes digital education through seminars and on-site support. The CoE organises in-service teachers to share their practices of digital education and explore the application of AI in teaching, thereby promoting peer learning. In the past year, the CoE offered over 200 training programmes for teachers with more than 14 000 training places, and nearly 140 times of on-site support services. Meanwhile, teaching demonstrations and lesson observation activities were also conducted on the campuses to share good practices in teaching. The support services of the CoE have covered more than 90 per cent of the publicly-funded primary and secondary schools, and the participating schools generally agree that the services meet their needs and help enhance teaching effectiveness.
 
Regarding the effectiveness of teacher training, in addition to conducting post-training surveys upon completion of training programmes, the EDB also provides on-site support services and organises lesson observation activities to evaluate the implementation. The EDB also invited all primary and secondary schools across the territory to take part in the Survey on Digital Education for the 2024/25 school year, with a response rate of nearly 92 per cent. The survey findings revealed that over 95 per cent of the teachers showed confidence in using e-tools to enhance teaching effectiveness; were able to grasp the essence of using e-tools to improve teaching effectiveness; and were able to make use of various e-tools to help students, inter alia, unleash their creativity and solve daily problems with technology. These findings are consistent with the usual training data, which indicate that teachers have built a good foundation in applying digital tools in teaching.

(2) With technology advancing at an unprecedented pace and societal expectations for teachers constantly rising, teachers must keep abreast of the times. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is key to the quality assurance of teaching. To this end, the EDB has established a professional development training framework for teachers, requiring all in-service teachers to complete 150 hours of CPD every three years. Within each three-year cycle, a minimum of 30 hours must be allocated to two categories of core training, namely ""Teachers' Professional Roles, Values and Conduct"" and ""Local, National and International Education Issues"", with not less than six hours spent on each category. The training framework allows teachers to utilise their training hours with openness and flexibility to participate in various activities or programmes that align with the needs of schools, students and their own professional development. AI and digital education fall under the category of ""Local, National and International Education Issues"". Currently, schools can devise school-based CPD plans according to their specific school context to facilitate teachers in fulfilling the training requirements.
 
Regarding the promotion criteria for teachers in aided schools, in addition to meeting the qualification requirements stipulated in the Codes of Aid, teachers must also complete the specified promotion training programmes within five years prior to their date of substantive promotion. The core training is provided by the EDB, and currently includes content on digital education. The elective training allows teachers to undertake relevant training based on the professional expertise required for the respective promotion posts. Given the varying contexts of different schools and the different professional duties of promotion posts, we do not recommend setting uniform and rigid criteria.

(3) Moving forward, the EDB will further expand the support services of the CoE and organise more seconded teachers to provide support in other schools. The number of resource schools has increased from 13 in the previous school year (2024/25) to 18, the number of seconded teachers has expanded from 26 to 34, and the number of support service items has increased from 16 to 23. In addition to focusing on areas such as promoting information literacy, e-assessment, using information technology to support students with special educational needs, and blended mode of learning, the support will also incorporate more AI elements, for example, how to plan the application of AI in teaching, AI in pedagogical and curriculum design, as well as AI and educational ethics.

The EDB will also implement various measures to encourage inter-school experience exchange and resource sharing. These include strengthening school-based professional support services, and supporting schools in integrating digital education tools into different Key Learning Areas/subjects. In addition, the Mainland-Hong Kong Teachers Exchange and Collaboration Programme will also facilitate cross-regional experience sharing and observation, thereby enhancing teachers' professional competence.

In addition, we will be launching progressively a new series of AI professional development programmes, which cover the core AI literacy areas required by school leaders and teachers, including ""AI Literacy courses"", ""AI+Subjects courses"", and ""AI Leadership courses"". This will enable teachers to participate in relevant training according to their needs of teaching and job positions.
 
In fact, given the varying school circumstances, the extent and pace of implementing digital education differ among schools. In addition to providing teacher training with emphasis on both quality and quantity, the EDB also encourages diverse school-based practices and promotes experience exchange and resource sharing through various school-based support and inter-school sharing activities to accelerate the pace of development of digital education.
  
In summary, building on existing strengths and foundations, the EDB will continue to optimise teacher professional training and school-based support services through a multi-pronged approach. We will also keep pace with the latest development of digital education, timely review the effectiveness and adjust strategies, to equip schools and teachers with the capacity to apply innovative technology to assist teaching, thereby fostering pedagogical innovation and enhancing learning effectiveness.

Thank you, President."

Hong Kong Customs and FSD mount operation against illicit fuel storage site and illegal fueling stations (with photos),2026-01-21 17:15,2026-01-21 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100405.htm,"Hong Kong Customs and the Fire Services Department (FSD) mounted a territory-wide joint operation codenamed ""Knockout"" targeting illicit fuel activities during the past two weeks (January 5 to 18), aiming to cut off the supply of illicit fuel and tackle illegal fueling activities in the downtown area. During the operation, Customs and the FSD detected eight cases and seized a total of about 7 100 litres of illegal motor spirit and 60 000 litres of diesel with an estimated market value of about $1.9 million. Seven vehicles involved in the cases were detained.

During the operation, officers of Customs and the FSD shut down three mobile illicit motor spirit fueling stations and two illicit diesel fueling stations in Kowloon Bay, Tsz Wan Shan, Tsing Yi and Tuen Mun. About 3 100 litres of illicit motor spirit, 60 000 litres of diesel and a large batch of fueling equipment were seized. Seven persons, believed to be the persons-in-charge of the illegal fueling stations, and three men who were coming for fueling, aged between 34 and 66, were involved in the cases. A total of six vehicles involved were also seized.

In addition, on January 8, 12 and 15, Customs officers dismantled one illicit motor spirit storage site and two illicit motor spirit fueling stations in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long. In the illicit motor spirit fueling station located in a tin-sheet structure in Tuen Mun, a cross-boundary truck which was unloading illicit motor spirit was intercepted. A 37-year-old non-local man, being the truck driver, and a 54-year-old non-local woman, believed to be the operator of the illegal fueling station, were arrested. A total of about 4 000 litres of illicit motor spirit, one cross-boundary truck and batches of fueling equipment were seized in the three cases.

The 12 individuals involved in the cases are suspected of dealing with or buying illicit fuel, violating various ordinances including the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Dangerous Goods Ordinance (DGO). Investigations are ongoing.

Customs will continue to collaborate with the FSD in combating illicit fuel activities. Members of the public are also urged not to patronise illegal fueling stations. The use of illicit fuel is a criminal offence, and vehicles involved may be liable to confiscation.

According to the DCO, any vehicle found conveying illicit motor spirit, as well as any tools, equipment, or articles used or intended to be used in connection with the commission of related offences, shall be liable to forfeiture whether or not any person is convicted of any offence. Anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit motor spirit commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Under the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation, it is an offence to possess or control any controlled substance for the business purpose of transferring it into vehicle fuel tanks. The DGO also provides that no person shall manufacture, store, convey or use any dangerous goods unless they possess a licence or exemption granted. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty for the first offence is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for six months. For each subsequent offence, the maximum penalty is a $200,000 fine and imprisonment for one year.

Moreover, Customs reminds cross-boundary goods vehicle drivers not to engage in any smuggling activities. Under the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO), any vehicle found to have the fittings, fabric or structure altered and used for smuggling purposes may be subject to forfeiture.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public are urged to report suspected illegal fuel activities via the Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or the FSD's 24-hour reporting hotline 5577 9666. The public may also report through the Illicit Fuelling Activities on the Fire Hazard Electronic Complaint Portal of the FSD (fhcp.hkfsd.gov.hk)."
Court makes review decision on sentencing for violating occupational safety and health legislation,2026-01-21 17:15,2026-01-21 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100508.htm,"​Regarding the sentencing in a fatal industrial accident, the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (January 21) handed down a review decision, accepting the prosecution's application for review of an earlier court sentence and increasing the fines imposed on the contractor.

The case involved a fatal accident that occurred on August 19, 2023, at a construction site in Chek Lap Kok, Lantau. A worker, while carrying out electrical installation work on the false ceiling of a building under construction, received an electric shock. The worker subsequently lost consciousness and passed away on the same day.

Hip Seng Builders Limited was prosecuted by the Labour Department (LD) for violations of the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations and the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Electricity) Regulations, and was fined $261,000 at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on January 23, 2025.

After the sentencing, the prosecution filed a review application with the court regarding the sentences imposed on the relevant contractor. The review hearing was brought up today before the court. The fines imposed on Hip Seng Builders Limited were increased to $521,000.

A spokesman for the LD said that the ruling will disseminate a strong message to all contractors that they have to protect workers' safety and health at work in accordance with the laws. The prosecution will continue to pay attention to court rulings and will file review or appeal applications for cases where the sentences are manifestly inadequate and/or wrong in principle."

此外，海關提醒跨境貨車司機切勿參與任何走私活動，如發現為走私目的而更改車輛的裝置、構造物或結構並加以利用，根據《進出口條例》，該車輛可予沒收。

走私屬嚴重罪行。根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

立法會四題：公立醫院護士人手,2026-01-21 16:15,2026-01-21 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100402.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上林哲玄議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

據報醫院管理局（醫管局）的護理人員長期嚴重不足，而公立醫院病房的護士和床位比例並無強制要求。此外，有前線護士憂慮，醫管局於去年逐步縮減護理職系中具有寶貴臨床經驗的自選兼職護士（即「locom nurses」）、退休後延任人員及臨床啟導員的人數，將嚴重影響新入職護士的培訓和臨床能力，增加病人風險。就此，政府可否告知本會，是否知悉：

（一）過去兩年，每年年底醫管局護理職系的自選兼職護士、退休後延任人員及臨床啟導員的人數分別為何；

（二）現時醫管局具五年以上資歷，以及三年或以下資歷的護士比例分別為何，以及有否制訂相關標準比例；醫管局有否計劃增加具五年以上資歷護士的比例；如有，計劃詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）現時醫管局臨床護士與病床數目的比例為何；有否計劃制訂相關目標比例及實施方案；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

香港擁有高水平的醫療專業和高效率的醫療系統，多項健康指標位居世界前列，為全球人均壽命最高（註一）而嬰兒死亡率最低（註二）的地區之一。二○二三至二四年度香港公共醫療衞生經常性開支相對本地生產總值的百分比只為4.3%（註三），與其他人口老化程度相若的經濟體比較，香港的相關開支比例屬於最低的地區之一，但已能提供全港超過九成醫療服務，並達致國際高水平的醫療質素，彰顯公營醫療系統的效率。

不過，香港醫療系統面對多項結構性挑戰。隨着人口年齡老化和慢性疾病急速上升，優質而高度補貼的公營醫療服務吸引龐大服務需求，令醫療系統承受沉重壓力。有鑑於此，醫院管理局（醫管局）積極推行不同措施以吸引、培訓和挽留人才，同時應用資訊科技提升效率。

就林議員的提問，我現在回覆如下：

（一）首先，醫護專業是本地醫療體系的基石。政府一直大力投入資源提升培訓質量，包括根據人手狀況及人力推算結果增加政府資助的培訓名額，以應對不斷攀升的醫療服務需求。為加強本地護士人手，相關院校培訓學額已逐步提升，由二○一六／一七學年起的約3 200名，增加近六成至二○二四／二五學年的約5 000名。

在人力資源管理方面，醫管局於二○二一年推出退休後延任政策，讓現職醫護人員於60歲退休後延任至65歲，透過挽留具經驗的醫護人員，在公立醫院執行臨床工作，紓緩人手情況，同時協助培訓及知識傳承。另一方面，醫管局亦成立自選兼職辦公室，積極聘請兼職醫護人員及推行更靈活的招聘策略。此外，為培育初級護士，醫管局加強臨床啟導計劃，聘請資深護師作臨床啟導員為初級護士提供指導，促進他們熟悉病房工作程序和環境。

二○二四年七月二十六日《護士註冊（修訂）條例》通過後，醫管局舉辦了一系列的宣傳活動，以吸引世界各地的非本地培訓護士加入醫管局。此外，醫管局亦積極與不同的非本地合作夥伴開展護士交流計劃。截至二○二五年十月底，累計共有170名非本地培訓護士以有限度註冊或特别註冊方式在醫管局執業或交流。

相關措施漸見成效。全職護士的流失率有所改善，由二○二三年三月底前連續12個月的高峰10.9%，回落至二○二五年十月底前連續12個月的6.0%。醫管局護士數目，以全職人員的人手計算，已由二○二四年三月的低位28 865人回升至二○二五年十月的30 533人，一年半間增加5.7%。

隨着近年流失率逐漸回落及全職護士人手增加，旨在填補短期空缺的自選兼職護士人數因而可以減少。過去兩年（即由二○二三年十月底至二○二五年十月底），醫管局護理職系的自選兼職護士、退休後延任人員及臨床啟導員的人數載於附件一。自選兼職護士由1 450人，兩年間微降至1 372人，但退休後延任人員以及臨床啟導員並非如質詢主題引言所指的縮減，而是不減反增，退休後延任人員由729人增至1 090人，而臨床啟導員則由149人增至181人。相對臨時或兼職安排，其實全職護士可於團隊內提供較為穩定及連貫的服務，有利持續推行病人護理計劃。醫管局會根據服務需求，安排臨時或兼職護士支援特定專科。

（二）截至二○二五年十月底，按服務年資劃分的醫管局護士人手數目載於附件二。有關數據反映，在醫管局33 683名護士中，任職三年以下的護士有9 463人，佔整體護士人手28.1%，而任職五年或以上的護士有20 049人，佔整體護士人手接近六成，十年或以上資深、較經驗豐富的護士也有12 878人，佔38.2%，當中大部分在前線提供服務，並同時協助培訓資歷較淺的護士，促進專業傳承。政府特別感謝公營醫療系統的護士在過去面對人手緊張的情況下，仍然堅守崗位，發揮南丁格爾的精神，在前線盡心、專業地照顧病人。醫管局會繼續透過多項措施招聘及挽留護士，以確保服務質素並促進專業傳承。同時，醫管局亦會為護士提供多元結構及創新培訓項目，當中包括擴大模擬培訓及專科培訓機會，以提升護理專業服務發展。

（三）為應付臨床服務需求和運作需要，醫管局亦聘有19 106名護理支援人員，包括病房服務員、病人服務助理等，支援護士為病人提供臨床護理工作。

截至去年三月底，醫管局所有病床數目為30 824張。由於醫管局內支援住院服務的醫護人員也同時負責其他服務包括專科門診，不同醫院及專科住院服務對護理人手需求也不一致，因此獨立計算住院服務護士的人手數目與整體病床數目的比例並不合適。

除密切留意人手情況外，醫管局會繼續積極應用資訊科技，涵蓋人工智能、智慧病房、智慧診所、智慧支援及數碼工作間等範疇，提升臨床及行政流程，以至資源運用效益。

多謝主席。

LCQ4: Manpower of nursing staff in public hospitals,2026-01-21 16:15,2026-01-21 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100398.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon David Lam and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  It has been reported that the Hospital Authority (HA) has long faced a severe shortage of nursing staff, and there are no mandatory requirements for the nurse-to-bed ratio in public hospital wards. Furthermore, some frontline nurses are concerned that over the past year, HA's gradual reduction in the number of locum nurses, personnel whose employment has been extended beyond retirement, as well as clinical preceptors, all of whom possess valuable clinical experience within the nursing grade, will have a significant impact on the training and clinical competence of newly recruited nurses, thereby increasing patient risks. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of locum nurses, personnel whose employment has been extended beyond retirement, and clinical preceptors within HA's nursing grade at the end of each of the past two years;

(2) of the respective ratios of nurses with over five years' experience and those with three years' experience or less in HA at present, and whether HA has formulated the relevant standard ratios; whether HA has plans to increase the ratio of nurses with over five years' experience; if so, of the details of the plans; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the ratio of HA's clinical nurses to the number of hospital beds at present; whether HA has plans to formulate a target ratio and implementation plan; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  With our high-quality healthcare professionals and highly efficient healthcare system, Hong Kong boasts a number of world-leading health indicators. We are among one of the regions with the longest life expectancies (Note 1) and lowest infant mortality rate in the world (Note 2). The public current health expenditures in Hong Kong only accounted for 4.3 per cent (Note 3) of its Gross Domestic Product in 2023-24. Compared with other economies with a similar degree of population ageing, Hong Kong's related expenditure ratio is among the lowest. On the other hand, we were able to provide over 90 per cent of the city's healthcare services and achieve a high service quality on par with international standards, demonstrating the remarkable efficiency of our public healthcare system.

  Nevertheless, Hong Kong's healthcare system is facing various structural challenges. With an ageing population and a surging prevalence of chronic diseases, quality and highly subsidised public healthcare services have attracted huge service demand, exerting immense pressure on the healthcare system. In light of the above, the Hospital Authority (HA) is actively implementing various measures to attract, train and retain manpower, while leveraging information technology to enhance efficiency.

  My reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Lam is as follows:

(1) First of all, healthcare professions are the cornerstone of the local healthcare system. The Government has consistently invested heavily in enhancing the training quality, including increasing government-funded training places based on manpower situations and projections to meet the rising demand for healthcare services. To enhance manpower of local nurses, the number of relevant training places in institutions has steadily increased by nearly 60 per cent from about 3 200 in the 2016/17 academic year to about 5 000 in the 2024/25 academic year.

  As for human resources management, the HA introduced the policy of Extending Employment Beyond Retirement (EER) in 2021, allowing serving healthcare staff to extend their service up to the age of 65 after reaching the retirement age of 60. This enables the retention of experienced healthcare professionals to continue taking up clinical duties in public hospitals, thereby alleviating manpower pressure and supporting training and knowledge transfer. On the other hand, the HA has also established the Locum Office to actively recruit part‑time healthcare staff and adopt more flexible hiring strategies. In addition, to nurture junior nurses, the HA has strengthened its preceptorship programme by recruiting experienced nurses as preceptors to provide clinical guidance for junior nurses, facilitating them to get familiarised with the ward procedures and environment.

  Following the passage of the Nurses Registration (Amendment) Ordinance on July 26, 2024, the HA has launched a series of promotional activities to attract non-locally trained nurses (NLTNs) to join the HA. Moreover, the HA has also been actively collaborating with various non-local partners to roll out nurse exchange programmes. As at the end of October 2025, a cumulative total of 170 NLTNs had practised or participated in exchanges in the HA under Limited Registration or Special Registration pathways.

  These measures have begun to yield results. The attrition rate of full-time nurses has improved, with the 12-month rolling figure falling from a peak rate of 10.9 per cent as at end-March 2023 to 6.0 per cent as at end-October 2025. The number of HA nurses counting on full-time basis has increased from a low level of 28 865 as at March 2024 to 30 533 as at October 2025, recording an increase of 5.7 per cent in one and a half year.

  With the gradual decline in the attrition rate and the increase in the number of full‑time nurses in recent years, the number of locum nurses, whose role is to fill short‑term vacancies, has therefore decreased. For the past two years (i.e. from end-October 2023 to end-October 2025), the numbers of locum nurses, EER staff and clinical preceptors in the HA's nursing grade are set out in Annex 1. While the number of locum nurses slightly decreased from 1 450 to 1 372 in two years, the numbers of EER staff and clinical preceptors did not decrease as indicated in the introduction of the question, in fact, they increased. The number of EER staff increased from 729 to 1 090 and that of clinical preceptors rose from 149 to 181. In contrast with temporary or locum arrangements, full‑time nurses are able to provide more stable and continuous services within clinical teams, which is conducive to the continuity of patient care plans. The HA will continue to arrange temporary or locum nurses to support designated specialties having regard to service needs.

(2) As at end‑October 2025, the distribution of HA's nurses by years of service is set out in Annex 2. The data shows that among the 33 683 nurses in the HA, 9 463 nurses were working for less than three years, representing 28.1 per cent of the overall nursing manpower; while 20 049 nurses had five years of service or more, representing nearly 60 per cent of the overall nursing manpower. There were 12 878 more experienced nurses with ten years of experience or more, representing 38.2 per cent of the overall nursing manpower. Most of these nurses serve on the frontline and assist in training less‑experienced nurses to facilitate professional succession. The Government is particularly thankful to nurses of public healthcare system who embody the spirit of Nightingale for their commitment, dedication and professionalism in taking care patients in the frontline amidst manpower pressure in the past. The HA will continue to implement various measures to recruit and retain nurses, with a view to ensuring service quality and facilitating professional succession. Meanwhile, the HA will also provide nurses with diversely structured and innovative training programmes, including providing more opportunities of simulation and specialty trainings, to enhance the development of professional nursing services.

(3) In order to meet clinical service demand and operation needs, the HA has also recruited 19 106 nursing supporting staff including ward assistants, patient care assistants and so on to support nurses for providing clinical care of patients.

  As at end‑March last year, the HA had a total of 30 824 hospital beds. As healthcare staff supporting inpatient services in the HA also undertake other duties (such as specialist out-patient services), the demand for nursing manpower varies across different hospitals and inpatient specialties. Therefore, computing a ratio of number of staff supporting in-patient services to that of overall hospital beds separately is not appropriate.

  Apart from closely monitoring manpower situations, the HA will continue to actively leverage information technologies, including areas like artificial intelligence, smart wards, smart clinics, smart support and digital workplaces, with a view to enhancing clinical and administrative workflows, and the effectiveness of resource utilisation.

  Thank you, President.

問題：

現時地政總署會通過招標或直接批地的方式批出短期租約，讓非政府機構或社會企業租用未批租和未撥用的政府土地。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，政府接獲有關短期租約用地作業者投訴的以下資料：（i）投訴數目（及其每年變化幅度）、（ii）投訴原因，以及（iii）有採取跟進行動的個案數目；

答覆：

主席：

根據現行土地審批政策，地政總署可通過招標或直接批地的方式批出短期租約，以支援各項與經濟民生有關的活動，並為政府帶來租金收入。此外，如申請獲得政策支持，以及經諮詢相關部門後獲確定合乎法定或行政要求，地政總署可以優惠租金甚至免租批出短期租約予非政府機構及社會企業作社區、團體或非牟利用途。地政總署負責批出及管理短期租約，固定租期一般為一年到五年不等，最長不超過七年，在固定租期屆滿後，通常會就另一固定租期重新招標或按情況獲續租。政府於二○二五年《施政報告》中提出，以更靈活的方式處理政府租約的租期，提供可續租至最長合共21年的租約，主要惠及經濟用途用地，以回應巿場認為須更長租約以協助業界營商投資的建議，相關措施會在今年第一季內推出。

就陳議員的提問各個部分，我們回覆如下：

（一）由於每宗投訴個案的性質及牽涉的土地類別不一，地政總署沒有備存只涉及短期租約用地的數字。一般而言，署方在接獲涉及對短期租約用地的投訴後，會盡快作出調查行動，包括到現場視察。若確立有違反租約條款的情況，例如違反用途限制條款，署方會立刻採取適當跟進行動，包括發出警告信要求租戶糾正違規事項，並按情況考慮根據租約條款中止租約及收回該土地。

（二）過往五年，地政總署新批出作商業、經濟、或社會用途的短期租約數目詳列於附件一，有關用途包括公眾收費停車場、教育、社會福利、宗教、休憩康樂、商鋪、工場、貨櫃處理、露天或有蓋存放、船廠等。

（三）過去五年，就作商業、經濟、或社會用途的短期租約的終止數目和涉及的面積詳列於附件二。一般而言，短期租約終止的主要原因包括：用地有長遠發展用途而需收回（例如公營房屋發展、政府賣地計劃等），以及個別租戶按自身考慮而退租。至於因違反租約條款而被中止租約的個案一般佔少數，例如在二○二五年只有約四宗。

（四）及（五）若短期租約的固定租期屆滿後未來幾年土地仍未需作長遠發展，地政總署一般會重新招標，讓市場上其他有意經營者獲得平等競投用地的機會，維持良性競爭。不過，與經濟活動用途相關、獲政策支持或基於特殊歷史因素而直接批出的租約，在固定租期屆滿後可按季續租。地政總署沒有備存就同一租戶獲續租的短期租約平均租期及面積的統計。根據地政總署備存的統計，透過直接批租累計年期超過10年的租約約1 800宗，當中很大部分（約1 550宗）屬幾個主要情況，包括為受公共工程影響而需重置業務所批出的短期租約（例如船廠）；由早年的政府土地牌照轉換而成的租約（通常為商鋪或工場）；以及一些公共事業或專營權利的業務用地（例如專營巴士車廠）。其中續租最長的租約年期為60年，租予作巴士員工食堂之用，以配合毗鄰尖沙咀碼頭巴士總站的營運。

政府以短期租約而非地契形式批出土地，可建基於多個考慮，包括土地本身只可供短期使用作某用途、土地可長期支持某用途但短期租約使用者的更替有更大彈性、土地可長期支持某用途但短期租約因為不涉一筆過地價支付會更符合某經濟活動的發展需要等。至於有意見認為個別租約似乎過長，正如上文解釋，這類租約大多有其政策或歷史原因。另一方面市場近年亦有聲音認為長租約較有利企業營商投資，這亦是我們建議將政府租約加長至最多21年的考慮之一。我們理解陳議員對公平競爭的關注，與此同時租約長短亦涉及其他考慮。日後我們批出新租約時會全面考慮相關因素並作出適當平衡。"
LCQ10: Short-term tenancies of land,2026-01-21 16:01,2026-01-21 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100395.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Judy Chan and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

The Lands Department (LandsD) currently grants short-term tenancies through tendering or direct land grant for non-governmental organisations or social enterprises to use unleased and unallocated government land. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information on complaints against short-term tenancy site operators received by the Government in the past five years: (i) the number of complaints (and their annual rates of changes), (ii) the reasons for complaints and (iii) the number of cases with follow-up actions taken;

(2) of the following information on (i) the number of sites newly granted under short-term tenancies in various districts in each of the past five years and the respective (ii) areas and (iii) uses of such sites involved, with a breakdown by land disposal method (i.e. tendering and direct land grant);

(3) of the following information on (i) the number of sites with their short-term tenancies terminated in various districts in each of the past five years and the respective (ii) areas involved and (iii) reasons for terminating the tenancies of such sites, with a breakdown by land disposal method (i.e. tendering and direct land grant);

(4) of (i) the number of sites with tenancies renewed by the same tenant upon expiry of the fixed term of the tenancies and the respective (ii) areas and (iii) uses of such sites involved in respect of short-term land tenancies managed by the LandsD in the past 10 years (set out by district); (i) the average renewal term and (ii) the longest renewal term of such sites with tenancies renewed by the same tenant, with a breakdown by land disposal method (i.e. tendering and direct land grant); and

(5) as there are views that the prolonged renewal of tenancies of some short-term tenancy sites by the same tenant has runs contrary to the spirit of short-term tenancy, whether the Government has conducted a review on the effectiveness in respect of short-term tenancy sites; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it has plans to conduct such a review?

Reply:

President,

Under the prevailing land approval policy, the Lands Department (LandsD) may grant short term tenancies (STTs) by way of tender or direct grant to support various social and economic activities and bring rental revenue for the Government. In addition, if an application receives policy support, and is considered in compliance with statutory or administrative requirements upon consultation with the relevant departments, the LandsD may grant STT to a non-governmental organisation and a social enterprise at concessionary or even nil rent for community, organisation, or non-profit making uses. The LandsD is responsible for granting and managing STTs, with fixed terms normally ranging from one to five years, and not exceeding seven years. Upon expiry of the fixed term, STTs will usually be re-tendered for another fixed term, or renewed according to the circumstances. The Government announced in the 2025 Policy Address that it would handle the tenancy term of Government tenancies in more flexible ways, and provide tenancy of a maximum total tenure of 21 years through renewal, which will mainly benefit lands for economic use, in response to the market suggestion of facilitating business and investments by providing a longer tenancy term. The relevant measures will be rolled out within the first quarter of this year.

My reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan is as follows:

(1) As the nature and the type of land involved in each complaint are different, the LandsD does not maintain statistics on cases involving solely STTs. In general, upon receipt of complaints relating to STT sites, the LandsD would carry out investigations, including site inspection, as soon as possible. If any breaches of tenancy conditions are confirmed, such as violation of the user restriction clauses, the LandsD would take follow-up action immediately, including the issue of warning letters requesting the tenants to rectify the breaches, and may, subject to the circumstances, terminate the tenancy in accordance with the tenancy conditions and take back the site.

(2) In the past five years, the number of STTs freshly granted by the LandsD for commercial, economic, or social uses is set out in Annex I. The relevant uses include fee-paying public car parks, education, social welfare, religious, recreation, shops, factories, container handling, outdoor or indoor storage, and shipyards.

(3) In the past five years, the number of STTs for commercial, economic, or social uses that were terminated and the area involved are set out in Annex II. In general, the major reasons for termination of STTs include taking back sites for long term development (such as public housing development, Government land sale programmes) and termination initiated by tenants on their own considerations. Besides, only a minority of STTs were terminated for breach of tenancy conditions. For example, there were only about four such cases in 2025.

(4) and (5) If the sites are still yet to be required for long term development a few years after the expiry of the fixed term of the STTs, the LandsD will normally re-tender the STTs, so as to allow other interested business operators in the market to have a fair opportunity in bidding for the sites, maintaining healthy competition. That said, direct grant STTs which are related to economic activities, with policy support, or special historical background, may be renewed quarterly upon expiry of the fixed term. The LandsD does not maintain statistics on the average term and the average area of the STT sites with tenancies renewed by the same tenant. According to the statistics maintained by the LandsD, among the direct grant STTs, there are some 1 800 cases with cumulative tenancy period exceeding 10 years, the majority of which (around 1 550 cases) fall within a few major categories, including STTs granted for relocation of businesses affected by public works (such as shipyards); STTs converted from Government land licence in early years (usually shops or workshops); and some sites for public utilities or franchise operation (such as franchised bus depot). Among them, the longest STT tenancy term through renewal is 60 years, where the site has been leased for the use of a bus workers' canteen, to tie in with the operation of the adjacent bus terminal at Tsim Sha Tsui pier.

The Government would take into account a number of considerations in examining whether a site should be granted by way of STT or land lease, including where the site may be available for certain uses only on a short term basis; where the site may be available for supporting certain uses on a long term basis but STTs would allow greater flexibility in changing STT users; and where the site may be available for supporting certain uses on a long term basis but STTs may better meet the development needs of certain economic activities as one-off premium payment would not be required. As regards views that certain STTs may have run for too long, as explained above, there are policy or historical reasons for the relevant STTs. On the other hand, there are views in the market in recent years that tenancies with longer term may facilitate business and investments, which is also one of the considerations for our suggestion to provide Government tenancies for at most 21 years. While we understand the Hon Chan's concerns about fair competition, we should also take into account various considerations when considering the term of tenancies. When we grant new tenancies in future, we will take into account the relevant factors holistically and strike an appropriate balance."

The public healthcare fees and charges reform will take effect on January 1 this year, with the Hospital Authority (HA) simultaneously enhancing the medical fee waiver mechanism, which will increase the number of eligible beneficiaries from 300 000 to 1.4 million. To handle the additional fee waiver applications, HA implemented special transitional arrangements (transitional arrangements) during the transition period from January to March this year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the number of medical fee waiver applications received by HA following the implementation of the transitional arrangements, as well as the number of applications approved and the average processing time;

(2) given that under the transitional arrangements, HA currently only permits patients with appointments at public hospitals in January or February of this year to submit medical fee waiver applications two months prior to their appointments, whether the Government knows when HA will commence processing applications from patients with appointments scheduled after February of this year, as well as from members of the public attending without appointments;

(3) as patients requiring immediate or urgent treatment during the transition period, who cannot afford medical expenses at the public sector but cannot provide complete documentation for financial assessment, will be granted ""conditional waivers"" by HA for full or partial medical fees, whether the Government knows how HA determines the amount of ""conditional waivers"" for such individuals in the absence of the requisite supporting documents; and

(4) as HA has established dedicated teams to assist patients with matters relating to medical fee waiver applications, whether the Government knows the staffing establishment of the dedicated teams and the expenditure involved?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Yang Wing-kit is as follows:

The fees and charges reform for public healthcare aims to, through reforming the subsidisation structure, guide the public to make optimal use of healthcare resources, reduce wastage and abuse, and enhance healthcare protection for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients on all fronts, thereby enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare system and strengthening the public healthcare system to cope with the challenges posed by an ageing population, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, persistent strain on healthcare resources, etc., and serve as a safety net for all. The various measures under the reform have been successfully implemented from January 1, 2026.

As an essential component of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare, the HA has concurrently expanded its medical fee waiver mechanism. Apart from the some 600 000 people who have been benefiting from medical fee waivers both before and after the reform (namely Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above and Level 0 Voucher Holders of the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly), the number of other eligible low-income individuals is estimated to significantly increase from approximately 300 000 to about 1.4 million - around 4.6 times the previous number of beneficiaries. This enables limited healthcare resources to be more precisely directed to help ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients who are most in need, while ensuring that no patient is denied medical care due to lack of means.

To handle the additional medical fee waiver applications, the HA has implemented the following special transitional arrangements to ensure patients are notified of the assessment results in a timely manner:

(i) Patients with appointments at public hospitals in January or February 2026 could submit the required documentation two months in advance (i.e. in November or December 2025). Applications were pre-assessed, and eligible patients could receive medical fee waiver certificates before their follow-up appointments after the fees and charges reform for public healthcare took effect on January 1, 2026; and

(ii) Patients with financial difficulty who require immediate or urgent treatment but cannot provide complete documentation for financial assessment will be granted ""conditional waivers"" for full or partial medical fees during the transitional period from January to March 2026. Eligible patients need only submit relevant documents within three months to receive official medical fee waiver certificates upon passing the assessment.

(1) Since the implementation of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare, the number of medical fee waiver applications approved by the HA has significantly increased by multiple times compared with the past, demonstrating that the reform has effectively strengthened support for low-income families and underprivileged groups. Recent data shows that the HA receives an average of about 5 900 medical fee waiver applications daily. From early November 2025, when the HA began accepting applications from patients for medical fee waivers applicable after the fees and charges reform for public healthcare takes effect, up until January 19, 2026, the HA has approved 91 479 medical fee waiver applications (including 47 051 ""conditional waivers""). This figure far exceeded the annual number of approximately 14 000 patients who were approved to receive medical fee waivers in the past. In other words, at least an additional 77 000 patients to date have already benefitted from the safety net under the enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism, from having to pay the fees and charges in full before the reform to now receiving fee waivers. According to approval records, approximately 82 per cent of applications were successfully approved on average, with some hospital clusters reaching over 90 per cent, with medical fee waiver certificates issued on the same day.

(2) The medical fee waiver mechanism aims to provide assistance to patients with financial difficulties and healthcare needs, ensuring they are not denied medical care due to lack of means. Financial assessment is therefore required and not everyone will be eligible. The HA must handle each application with due diligence for proper use of public funds. Patients also have the responsibility to provide complete, accurate, truthful and appropriate information for assessment and verification to help ensure that assistance reaches patients truly in need. While ensuring that no patient is denied medical care due to lack of means, it is also essential for the HA to uphold the principle of prudent use of resources to prevent the limited and precious public resources from being abused. In general, those who have financial difficulty and are eligible for medical fee waivers are from low-income families with relatively simple asset structure. The assessment process is not complicated.

To facilitate eligible patients in obtaining medical fee waiver certificates before their appointments, the HA advises patients to begin the application process approximately one to two months before their scheduled appointments. The HA is accordingly now accepting applications for medical fee waivers from patients with scheduled appointments within two months. Citizens with scheduled appointments beyond two months or without any appointments do not need to apply at this stage.

(3) Patients applying for ""conditional waivers"" need only sign a declaration form and state their approximate financial circumstances to be granted a ""conditional waiver"" for full or partial medical fees valid for three months. However, as aforementioned, ""conditional waiver"" is only a special flexible arrangement for patients who require urgent medical services but are unable to provide the required documentation for financial assessment. Therefore, such patients must still submit all the relevant documents for financial assessment within the validity period of the ""conditional waiver"". Eligible patients will be issued an official medical fee waiver certificate, which will replace the conditional waiver certificate. If patients fail to submit the required documents within the three-month deadline or do not meet the relevant eligibility criteria, they will be required to settle all applicable fees (if any). To ensure the appropriate use and prevent abuse of healthcare resources, the HA will conduct regular random reviews of approved cases.

(4) The HA established the Designated Financial Assessment Team for Waiver Application (designated team) in November 2025, with an establishment of approximately 180 staff members. This team is deployed across the seven hospital clusters to assist in triaging and processing the medical fee waiver applications. The team is made up of Social Work Officers, Assistant Social Work Officers, Executive Officers and Executive Assistants. Most team members are stationed within the Medical Social Services Units. As of December 2025, the actual expenditure for hiring the staff for the designated team is approximately $9 million. The HA will closely monitor the volume of medical fee waiver applications and increase or redeploy personnel to the designated team as necessary to meet service demands in due course, ensuring efficient resource utilisation and timely processing of citizens' medical fee waiver applications."

​立法會十五題：公營醫療收費改革,2026-01-21 16:00,2026-01-21 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100423.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上楊永杰議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

公營醫療收費改革於今年一月一日實施，而醫院管理局（醫管局）也同步優化醫療費用減免機制，讓合資格受惠的人士由30萬增至140萬。為了處理新增的費用減免申請，醫管局於今年一月至三月的過渡期間採取一系列特別過渡安排（過渡安排）。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，醫管局實施過渡安排後所接獲的醫療費用減免申請數目，以及當中的獲批申請數目及平均審批時間為何；

（二）鑑於在過渡安排下，現時醫管局僅讓已預約於今年一月或二月在公立醫院應診的病人，在就診前兩個月提交醫療費用減免申請，政府是否知悉，醫管局何時開始處理已預約今年二月後應診的病人及非預約應診市民的申請；

（三）鑑於有經濟困難的病人，如在過渡期間需即日或緊急接受治療，但又未能提供相關文件完成經濟審查，醫管局會發出「有條件減免」豁免其全額或部分醫療費用，政府是否知悉，醫管局在缺乏所需證明文件下如何決定該等人士可獲「有條件減免」的金額；及

（四）鑑於醫管局已設立專責隊伍協助病人處理申請醫療費用減免的相關事宜，政府是否知悉，該專責隊伍的人手編制及所涉開支為何？

答覆：

主席：

就楊永杰議員的提問，經諮詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現回覆如下：

公營醫療收費改革旨在透過改革資助架構，引導市民善用醫療資源、減少浪費濫用，全方位加強對「貧、急、重、危」病人的醫療保障，從而提升醫療系統的可持續性，並強化公營醫療系統來應對人口老化、慢性疾病日益普遍及醫療資源持續緊張等挑戰，發揮全民安全網的作用。改革的各項措施已於二○二六年一月一日順利推行。

作為公營醫療收費改革的重要部分，醫管局同時擴大了醫療費用減免機制。除改革前後均受惠於全額醫療費用豁免的約60萬人（即綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受助人及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人）外，其他合資格低收入人士由過往估計約30萬大幅增加至約140萬，是過去人數約4.6倍，令有限的醫療資源可更精準投放幫助最有需要的「貧、急、重、危」病人，同時確保不會有病人因為經濟原因而未能接受醫療服務。

為了處理新增的醫療費用減免申請，醫管局採取以下特別過渡安排，以便病人適時獲知審核結果：

（i）病人如已預約於二○二六年一月或二月在公立醫院應診，可於就診前兩個月（即二○二五年十一月或十二月）提交所需證明文件。病人的申請會獲預先審核，合資格者可於二○二六年一月一日公營醫療收費改革實施後，在覆診前獲發醫療費用減免證明書；及

（ii）有經濟困難的病人，如需即日或緊急接受治療，但又未能提供相關文件完成經濟審查，醫管局會在二○二六年一月至三月過渡期間發出「有條件減免」豁免全額或部分醫療費用。合資格的病人需在三個月內補交相關文件，通過審查後便可獲發正式醫療費用減免證明書。

（一）自公營醫療收費改革實施以來，醫管局批出的醫療費用減免申請較以往以倍數大幅增加，顯示改革有效加強支援低收入家庭及弱勢社群。近日數據顯示，醫管局每日平均接獲約5 900宗醫療費用減免申請。醫管局自二○二五年十一月初開始接受病人提交適用於公營醫療收費改革生效後的醫療費用減免申請，截至二○二六年一月十九日，醫管局已批出91 479宗醫療費用減免申請（當中包括47 051宗「有條件減免」豁免），數目已遠高於過往每年約14 000名病人獲批減免，亦即到目前為止已至少有額外77 000多名病人受惠於醫療費用減免機制放寬後的安全網，從改革前需付全費，改為現時獲得費用減免。根據批核紀錄，平均約82%申請個案成功獲批減免，部分醫院聯網超過90%，並可於即日獲發醫療費用減免證明書。
 
（二）醫療費用減免機制旨為經濟有困難而有醫療需要的病人提供援助，確保他們不會因經濟原因而得不到適當的醫療照顧，故需要經濟審查，而非任何人皆符合資格。醫管局基於善用公帑必須審慎處理每宗申請，病人亦有責任提供完整、準確、真確及合適的資料，以供評估和核對，令援助能確實幫助真正有需要的病人。醫管局在確保不會有病人因為經濟困難而未能接受合適醫療服務的同時，亦必須秉持審慎運用資源的原則，讓有限及珍貴的公共資源不被濫用。一般有經濟困難而符合醫療費用減免申請人士為低收入家庭，資產較簡單，審批過程並不複雜。

為方便合資格病人可於應診前獲批醫療費用減免證明書，醫管局建議病人可以在就診前預留約一至兩個月時間開始辦理申請手續。醫管局現時已接受預約診期為兩個月內的病人申請醫療費用減免。預約診期為超過兩個月後或未有任何預約的市民現階段不需申請。

（三）病人在申請「有條件減免」時，只須簽署聲明書及聲明大概經濟狀況，便可獲批有效期為三個月的全額或部分的「有條件減免」。然而，正如前文所述，「有條件減免」僅為向未能提交所需證明文件進行經濟審查，而又急需使用醫療服務的病人作出的特別彈性安排。故此，有關病人仍須在「有條件減免」有效期提交所有文件以進行經濟評估。合資格病人將獲發正式醫療費用減免證明書，並取代有條件醫療費用減免證明書。如病人未能於三個月限期內提交文件或未符合相關申請資格，屆時必須清繳所有應繳的費用（如有）。為了確保醫療資源運用恰當，並防止被濫用，醫管局會定期隨機覆查已批核的個案。

（四）醫管局於二○二五年十一月起成立編制共約180人的「醫院管理局醫務社會服務（醫療費用減免）專隊」（專隊），分布於轄下的七個醫院聯網，協助分流處理醫療費用減免申請。專隊由社會工作主任、助理社會工作主任、行政主任和行政助理組成，大部分的專隊駐員於醫務社會服務部內。截至二○二五年十二月，聘用專隊人員的實際開支約為900萬元。醫管局會密切監視醫療費用減免申請的數量，並會適時按需要增加或調配專隊的人手以滿足服務需求，確保能善用資源並適時處理市民的醫療費用減免申請。"
​立法會五題：地區康健中心和地區康健站,2026-01-21 15:55,2026-01-21 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100383.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上陳克勤議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

現時全港18區仍有八區未有設立地區康健中心（下稱「康健中心」），當中包括大埔區和沙田區。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年各個已啟用的康健中心和地區康健站的開支、人手編制、會員人數，以及其服務量目標及達標率分別為何；該等康健中心就第一層至第三層預防疾病服務所舉辦的活動、講座、健康風險評估和各項計劃（例如慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃）的數目和參與人數分別為何；

（二）政府會否加快推展預計於二○三一年落成的大埔區康健中心，以及盡快落實沙田區康健中心的選址及落成時間表，並考慮於沙田區內的公共屋邨增設康健站以便利市民；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）政府預計在各區設立康健中心後，涉及第二層及第三層醫療（即專科及醫院，以及特殊及複雜醫療）的病人數目和開支將減少多少；有否就此訂立績效指標？

答覆：

主席：

基層醫療署正按《基層醫療健康藍圖》，逐步擴展由地區康健中心及地區康健站（統稱康健中心）作樞紐的地區康健網絡，目標是在提供全面、連貫、以人為本的跨專業基層醫療服務，包括慢性疾病篩查及管理、家庭醫生配對、護士及專職醫療支援、健康風險評估、社區復康和健康推廣等。在地區康健中心投入運作前，康健站率先提供同類服務，讓市民更早受惠。兩者的主要分別在於設施規模、選址及人力配置，而它們的功能是一樣。

就陳克勤議員的提問，我現在回覆如下：

（一）康健中心過去三個財政年度的開支，包括服務合約、場地保養和租金，列於附件一；二○二五／二六年度員工編制列於附件二；全港18區累計所有康健中心的服務人次超過360萬，包括健康推廣／教育、健康風險評估、篩查、慢病管理等，詳細數字列於附件三。

康健中心推廣「一人一家庭醫生」概念，在二○二三年推出「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」）後，康健中心每年新增會員人數由二○一九／二○年度約2 900人，大幅上升至二○二四／二五年度約153 500人，會員總數現已達485 200人。所有康健中心於二○二四／二五年度均達服務目標要求。

「慢病共治計劃」「三高」篩查初見成效，截至去年十二月十七日，約有185 200名市民參加，其中約112 300名（約六成）完成篩查（註一），其中約48 000名（約四成）被診斷為血糖偏高（註二），或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂，而進入治療階段，獲政府資助接受跨專業跟進，達致「早發現、早治療」的目標。

（二）康健中心已自二○二二年起全面覆蓋全港18區。醫務衞生局會因應服務模式、人口結構及分布、需求等，持續檢視康健中心選址，務求提供便捷和地區為本的基層醫療服務。

大埔地區康健站現有八個服務點，在大埔宏福苑火災的善後工作中，康健站即時調派護士支援臨時庇護中心內的醫療站，並統籌逾500名義務醫護人員即場提供醫療協助；其後康健站更聯同全港所有康健中心為搬到不同地區的受影響居民安排個案管理的基層醫療服務，包括配對中、西、牙醫義診，以及心理支援，和協調醫院管理局覆診及配藥安排。

政府計劃於安邦路前大埔賽馬會泳池用地設立社區健康中心大樓，並作為大埔地區康健中心選址。政府正因應去年九月的大埔區議會意見檢視大樓設施安排與服務設計，確保切合社區需要和成本效益。確定設施後，工務部門將檢視及規劃擬定工程時間表。我們會致力盡早落實項目。

沙田地區康健站現有兩個服務點，預計最快今年第二季於瀝源健康院增設第三個服務點。長遠暫定於火炭山尾街社區設施聯用綜合大樓設置沙田地區康健中心，該項目已於二○二一年十月獲沙田區議會支持。中心設立前，政府會密切監察服務需求和研究增設或擴充服務點。

（三）地區康健網絡是基層醫療體系重要一環，在宏福苑火災的醫療支援工作中，康健中心正正發揮關鍵的樞紐作用，為受影響居民安排個人化個案管理的基層醫療服務，提供便捷和全面的支援，透過即時在社區提供適切及妥善照顧，協調有需要居民接受公營、私營醫療，以至中醫和牙科專科的跨專業醫療服務，既有助減輕醫院服務壓力，更在社區層面提供人性化、有溫度的支援。

正如《藍圖》指出，發展基層醫療可延遲及減少人口老化下個人對第二和第三層醫療的負擔，長遠緩減醫療開支的增長率。

以「慢病共治計劃」為例，本地大學研究團隊初步分析估算，「慢病共治計劃」在健康和成本效益方面表現良好。參加者健康狀況普遍改善：在參與計劃後的六個月，糖尿病患者平均糖化血紅素（HbA1c）由7.8%降至6.8%；高血壓患者平均收縮壓由151 mmHg 降至136 mmHg。若以20萬參與人數作示例，預計可預防約 9 000宗心血管疾病和11 000 宗死亡個案，從而賺獲約54 000個質量調整壽命年，即quality-adjusted life years，節省約27億元醫療開支。

再以另一個例子——第一階段乳癌篩查先導計劃為例，二○二一至二○二四年期間，超過37 000名年齡介乎44至69歲的中風險及一般風險女性接受乳癌風險評估。先導計劃顯示通過乳癌篩查確診的患者有97%為早期癌症，即第一或第二期乳癌。以風險為本的篩查能及早發現及治療乳癌，提升患者治癒和康復機會，亦會減低醫療成本。

我們將繼續推展基層醫療措施及檢視成效，確保基層醫療發展能提升市民健康，促進整個醫療體系的可持續發展。多謝主席。

註一：「慢病共治計劃」初期（二○二五年三月二十八日前）的篩查項目為糖尿病及高血壓，其後擴展至包括血脂檢查。因此，完成篩查的參加者中，部分只接受了糖尿病和高血壓篩查，其餘則接受「三高」篩查。

註二：血糖偏高指糖化血紅素6.0-6.4%或空腹血糖6.1-6.9 mmol/L水平。"
LCQ5: District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses,2026-01-21 15:55,2026-01-21 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100389.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hak-kan and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

Currently, eight of Hong Kong's 18 districts, including Tai Po and Sha Tin, have yet to set up District Health Centres (DHCs). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the expenditure, staffing establishment, number of members, service capacity targets and achievement rates for each of the operational DHCs and DHC Expresses (DHCEs) in each of the past three years; the respective numbers of activities, seminars, health risk assessments and various programmes (such as the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme) organised by these DHCs for primary to tertiary disease prevention services, along with the respective number of participants;

(2) whether the Government will expedite the development of the Tai Po DHC which is scheduled for completion in 2031, promptly finalise the site selection and completion timetable for the Sha Tin DHC, and consider establishing additional DHCEs within public housing estates in Shatin district to enhance public accessibility; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) the Government's projected reduction in the number of patients and expenditure involved in secondary and tertiary healthcare (namely hospital and specialist care, as well as specialised care) following the establishment of DHCs in various districts; whether performance indicators have been established in this regard?

Reply:

President,

  The Primary Healthcare Commission is progressively expanding the district health network with District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) serving as hubs in accordance with the Primary Healthcare Blueprint (Blueprint), with a view to providing comprehensive, coherent and people-oriented multidisciplinary services, including chronic disease screening and management, family doctor pairing, nursing and allied health support, health risk assessment, community rehabilitation and health promotion. Prior to the commencement of District Health Centre operation, District Health Centre Expresses started to provide services of the same kind, enabling citizens to benefit earlier. The main differences between the two lie in the scale of facilities, site selection, and manpower allocation, while their functions are the same.

  My reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hak-kan is as follows:

(1) The expenditure of DHCs, including provisions for service contracts, site maintenance and rental cost, in the past three financial years is at Annex I. The information on staff establishment in 2025-26 is at Annex II. The cumulative number of attendances of all DHCs in Hong Kong exceeds 3 600 000, which includes health promotion/education, health risk assessment, screening, chronic disease management, with details at Annex III.

  DHCs promote the ""Family Doctor for All"" concept. Following the introduction of the Chronic Disease Co-care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme) in 2023, the number of new DHC members per year significantly increased from around 2 900 in 2019-20 to approximately 153 500 in 2024-25. To date, the cumulative membership of DHCs has reached 485 200. All DHCs attained the service volume targets in 2024-25.

  The screening of ""three highs"" under the CDCC Pilot Scheme has shown initial effectiveness. As at December 17 last year, around 185 200 citizens have enrolled in the CDCC Pilot Scheme. Among those, approximately 112 300 participants (i.e. about 60 per cent) have completed the screenings (Note 1), of which around 48 000 (i.e. about 40 per cent) have been diagnosed with prediabetes (Note 2), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT) or dyslipidaemia. The latter participants can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to receive multidisciplinary follow-up in order to achieve the goal of ""early identification and early treatment"".

(2) The DHCs have achieved comprehensive coverage across all 18 districts of Hong Kong since 2022. The Health Bureau will continuously review the site selection of DHCs, taking into account the service model, demographic structure and distribution, demand, etc., with a view to providing convenient and district-based primary healthcare services.

  The Tai Po District Health Centre Express currently operates eight service points. During the relief work of the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire, it instantly deployed nurses to support the medical stations at temporary shelters, and also co-ordinated over 500 volunteer healthcare professionals for the provision of onsite medical assistance. Subsequently, it arranged case management primary healthcare services for affected residents relocated to different districts together with all DHCs in Hong Kong, which include pairing with free consultation services provided by Chinese medicine practitioners, doctors, dentists and psychological support, as well as co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority.

  The Government plans to construct a community health centre building at the ex-Jockey Club swimming pool site at On Pong Road, and designate it as the site for the Tai Po District Health Centre. The Government is currently reviewing the building facilities arrangement and service design in light of the feedback from the Tai Po District Council (DC) last September, with an aim to ensuring the proposal meets community needs and is cost-effective. When the facilities are finalised, the works department will review and plan the implementation timetable for the project. We will strive to implement the project as early as possible.

  The Sha Tin District Health Centre Express currently has two service points, and is anticipated to establish a third service point at Lek Yuen Health Centre in the second quarter of this year at the earliest. In the longer term, it is tentatively planned to establish the Sha Tin District Health Centre in the Joint-user Complex for Community Facilities at Shan Mei Street, Fo Tan. This project received the endorsement of the Sha Tin DC in October 2021. Prior to the establishment of the District Health Centre, the Government will closely monitor the service needs and explore the addition or expansion of service points.

(3) The district health network is a vital component within the primary healthcare system. During the medical support efforts following Wang Fuk Court fire, DHCs have demonstrated their pivotal role as a hub to provide personalised case management primary healthcare services for affected residents, offering convenient and comprehensive support. By providing timely, appropriate and proper care within the community, and co-ordinating access to public healthcare, private healthcare and multidisciplinary medical services such as Chinese medicine and dental service for residents in need, this not only alleviates pressure on hospital services, but also delivers people-oriented and compassionate support at the community level.

  As set out in the Blueprint, the development of primary healthcare may delay and alleviate the healthcare burden on secondary and tertiary healthcare brought about by an ageing population and thus slow down the rate of increase in healthcare expenditure in the long run.

  Taking the CDCC Pilot Scheme as an example, the preliminary analysis conducted by a local university research team indicated that the CDCC Pilot Scheme performed well in terms of health benefits and cost-effectiveness. Participants' health conditions improved overall: after six months of participating in the Scheme, the average glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of DM patients dropped from 7.8 per cent to 6.8 per cent; while the average systolic blood pressure of HT patients decreased from 151 mmHg to 136 mmHg. Based on a modelled scenario of 200 000 participants, it was expected that the Scheme could prevent approximately 9 000 cases of cardiovascular diseases and 11 000 deaths, thereby gaining approximately 54 000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and saving $2.7 billion in health expenditure.

  Taking Phase I of the Breast Cancer Screening Pilot Programme (BCSPP) as another example, from 2021 to 2024, over 37 000 women aged between 44 and 69 at moderate and average risk have received breast cancer risk assessment. The BCSPP showed that 97 per cent of breast cancer cases identified through breast cancer screening were at early stages, i.e. stage I or stage II. The risk-based screening can enhance the recovery rate of breast cancer patients through early detection and treatment, and will also lower the medical cost.

  We will continue to advance primary healthcare initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness to ensure that primary healthcare development enhances public health and fosters the sustainable development of the entire healthcare system. Thank you, President.

Note 1: The CDCC Pilot Scheme screened for DM and HT in the initial phase (before March 28, 2025), and was later expanded to include blood lipid screening. Therefore, some of the participants who completed the screening were screened for DM and HT only, while the rest were screened for the ""three highs"".

Note 2: Prediabetes with glycated haemoglobin level of 6.0 to 6.4 per cent or fasting plasma glucose level of 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L."

主席：

口腔健康是構成身體健康的重要一環，對個人的健康、日常生活，以至健康老齡化至關重要。牙醫和牙科護理專業人員（牙專人員）（包括牙齒衞生員和牙科治療師）同屬專業醫療系統的一部分，政府對他們的人手供應高度重視。除了增加大學教育資助委員會資助的牙醫學士課程學額外，政府早前修訂《牙醫註冊條例》（《條例》）為引入非本地培訓牙醫開闢新途徑，亦為牙專人員設立法定註冊制度以確立其專業地位，並按風險為本的原則適度調整其執業範圍，讓牙專人員在基層口腔健康護理中擔當更重要的角色。

就林振昇議員的提問，經諮詢香港牙醫管理委員會（牙管會）後，現回覆如下：

牙科護理服務最新發展

政府二○二四年公布口腔健康及牙科護理工作小組總結報告，並參照報告的策略建議，制定相應的口腔健康行動計劃，包括通過「做闊做淺」的策略廣泛向所有年齡層市民，推廣以預防為重的基層口腔健康護理，並以「做窄做深」的策略聚焦為弱勢社群提供必需的牙科護理服務。

按「做闊做淺」的策略，政府透過地區康健中心及非政府機構，於社區提供口腔健康教育、口腔衞生指導和風險評估等服務，加強基層醫療健康服務。參照牙專人員法定註冊制度落實進度，政府計劃於指定地區康健中心／站安排牙齒衞生員提供服務，並與相關牙醫診所合作，協助地區康健中心／站為指定高風險群組市民提供上述的口腔健康護理服務，分階段擴展至全港18區的地區康健中心／站。

按「做窄做深」的策略，政府於二○二五年五月推出「社區牙科支援計劃」（計劃），增加為有經濟困難的弱勢社群提供獲政府資助的牙科服務。現時共有32間非政府組織參與計劃，在逾80個服務點為合資格參加者提供服務，覆蓋全港18區。截至二○二五年十二月三十一日，計劃已有逾5 700名參加者使用服務。政府會持續監察計劃的服務使用量和需求，適時檢討計劃並按需要及考慮所需資源，研究增添服務單位及服務點。

牙科護理專業人手

自立法會在二○二四年七月通過修訂《條例》容許合資格非本地培訓牙醫來港執業，衞生署進行了全球招聘工作，以非公務員合約形式招聘全職合約牙科醫生（牙科全科），共接獲超過90份非本地培訓牙醫申請，經過嚴格遴選後陸續發出12份聘書供非本地培訓牙醫申請有限度註冊。當中11位於獲牙管會批准有限度註冊後，已於二○二五年內陸續到衞生署赴任。新一輪的全職合約牙科醫生（牙科全科）的招聘工作已於二○二五年十一月展開，相關聘任程序正在進行中。

截至二○二五年年底，牙管會共接獲22宗有限度註冊的申請，其中19宗申請獲批，他們來自的地區包括中國內地、英國和馬來西亞等，分別有11名於衞生署和八名於香港大學工作。有關申請數字詳見附件一。

政府致力增加牙科護理專業人力資源，逐步提高牙齒衞生員和牙科治療師培訓學額，由二○二三／二四學年起的95名，增加超過一倍至二○二五／二六學年的220名。截至二○二五年年底，牙齒衞生員的總登記人數共有682名，而衞生署共有238名牙科治療師（註）。

為吸引更多年輕人投身行業，衞生署已在二○二三／二四學年開始向修讀牙齒衞生員和牙科治療師課程的學生提供全額學費資助。獲資助的牙齒衞生員和牙科治療師在畢業後，須在衞生署轄下或指定的非政府組織牙科診所工作至少一年。以上措施有助日後提供足夠人手，支援政府、私營機構和非政府組織推出各項牙科護理服務。第一批獲衞生署提供全額學費資助的15名牙科治療師和六名牙齒衞生員培訓課程的學生已於二○二四年下半年畢業。該15名牙科治療師畢業生在衞生署轄下的學童牙科診所工作，在完成一年服務期後均繼續留任。至於該六名牙齒衞生員畢業生，目前他們的一年服務期尚未完成，當中有三名在衞生署轄下的政府牙科診所工作，其餘三名則在指定的非政府機構牙科診所工作。衞生署一直密切留意這些畢業生在衞生署或指定的非政府機構的就業及留任情況，希望吸引更多年輕人投身行業，有助日後提供足夠人手，支援政府、私營機構和非政府組織推出各項牙科護理服務。

關於衞生署牙專人員的聘任安排，衞生署正就牙專人員入職要求和薪酬待遇等事宜進行檢討。視乎牙專人員法定註冊制度和牙齒衞生員註冊的最低學歷要求的實施，衞生署會適時修訂牙齒衞生員和牙科治療師職系的入職要求，以符合《條例》的要求。因應牙齒衞生員職系的入職條件修訂，包括其學歷要求的提升，衞生署正有序推進牙齒衞生員職系架構檢討的工作。

二○二三至二○二五年，政府牙醫和牙專人員職系的資料見附件二。

註：目前，牙齒衞生員可在公營或私營界別工作，並按照時刻在處所內的牙醫指示，進行預防牙科護理。牙科治療師只受聘於衞生署，提供學童牙科保健服務。在牙專人員法定註冊制度生效後，所有牙專人員（包括牙科治療師）均可在衞生署以外（包括公營或私營界別機構）提供服務。"

Reply:

President,

  Oral health is an integral part of general health, crucial to an individual's well-being, daily life, and healthy ageing. Dentists and dental care professionals (DCPs) (including dental hygienists and dental therapists) are part of the professional healthcare system. The Government attaches great importance to their manpower supply. In addition to increasing the University Grants Committee-funded training places for the Bachelor of Dental Surgery programme, the Government previously amended the Dentists Registration Ordinance (the Ordinance) to establish new pathways for the admission of non-locally trained dentists. The amendments also introduced a statutory registration system for DCPs to recognise their professional status and adjusted their scope of practice moderately based on risk-based principles, enabling DCPs to play a more important role in primary oral healthcare.

  Regarding the question raised by the Hon Lam Chun-sing, having consulted the Dental Council of Hong Kong (DCHK), the reply is as follows:

Latest developments in dental care services

  In 2024, the Government released the final report of the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care and formulated a corresponding Oral Health Action Plan with reference to the strategic recommendations in the report. These include widely promoting prevention-oriented primary oral healthcare among citizens across all age groups, and providing essential dental care services targeting underprivileged groups.

  Under the strategy of developing community-wide preventive primary oral healthcare, the Government strengthens primary healthcare services through District Health Centres (DHCs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) by providing services such as oral health education, oral hygiene instruction and risk assessment in the community. Making reference to the implementation progress of the statutory registration system for DCPs, the Government plans to arrange dental hygienists to provide services at designated DHCs/DHC Expresses and assist the DHCs/DHC Expresses in providing the aforementioned oral health care services to designated high-risk groups in collaboration with relevant dental clinics, with a view to extending to DHCs/DHC Expresses in all 18 districts in Hong Kong in phases.

  Under the strategy of provision of essential dental services targeting underprivileged groups, the Government launched the Community Dental Support Programme (CDSP) in May 2025 to provide additional government-subsidised dental services to the underprivileged groups with financial difficulties. Currently, 32 NGOs are participating in the CDSP, providing over 80 service points to eligible service users covering all 18 districts in Hong Kong. As at December 31 last year, over 5 700 participants had used the service. The Government will continue to monitor the service utilisation and demand of the CDSP, conduct review at appropriate juncture and explore increasing service units and service points subject to needs and resource availability.

Dental care professional manpower

  Since the Legislative Council passed the amendments to the Ordinance in July 2024 to allow qualified non-locally trained dentists to practice in Hong Kong, the Department of Health (DH) has conducted global recruitment exercises. The DH recruited full-time Contract Dentists (General Dentistry) on non-civil service contract terms. A total of over 90 applications from non-locally trained dentists were received. Twelve offers were issued for non-locally trained dentists to apply for limited registration after rigorous selection. Among them, 11 have reported for duty at the DH in 2025 after the limited registration were approved by the DCHK. A new round of recruitment for full-time Contract Dentists (General Dentistry) commenced in November 2025, and the relevant appointment procedures are in progress.

  As at end-2025, the DCHK received a total of 22 applications for limited registration, of which 19 were approved. The applicants came from regions including the Chinese Mainland, the United Kingdom and Malaysia, with 11 working at the DH and eight at the University of Hong Kong. The detail of the number is at Annex I.

  The Government is committed to increasing the manpower resources for dental care professionals, and had gradually increased training places for dental hygienists and dental therapists. The number of training places has more than doubled from 95 in 2023/24 academic year to 220 in 2025/26 academic year. As at the end-2025, there are a total of 682 registered dental hygienists, whereas 238 dental therapists (note) are working in the DH.

  To attract more young people to join the industry, the DH has been offering full tuition fee sponsorship since 2023/24 academic year to students studying the programmes for dental hygienists and dental therapists. Dental hygienists and dental therapists who have received the sponsorship are required to work in dental clinics of the DH or other designated NGOs for at least one year after graduation. The above measures could help provide sufficient manpower to support the Government, private institutions and NGOs in launching various dental care services in future. The first batch of 15 dental therapist students and six dental hygienist students receiving full tuition sponsorship from the DH graduated in the second half of 2024. The 15 dental therapist graduates are working in the School Dental Clinics under the DH, and all of them have remained in service after completing the one-year service period. As for the six dental hygienist graduates, their one-year service period has not yet been completed. Three of them are working in government dental clinics under the DH and the remaining three are working in designated NGO dental clinics. The DH has been closely monitoring the employment and retention situation of these graduates in the DH or designated NGOs, hoping to attract more young people to join the industry, which will help provide sufficient manpower in the future to support the Government, private institutions and NGOs in launching various dental care services.

  Regarding the appointment arrangements for DCPs in the DH, the DH is reviewing matters such as entry requirements and remuneration packages of DCPs. Subject to the implementation of the statutory registration system for DCPs and the minimum academic qualification requirements for dental hygienists, the DH will revise the entry requirements for the Dental Hygienist and Dental Therapist grades at appropriate juncture to comply with the requirements of the Ordinance. In response to the amended entry requirements of the Dental Hygienist grade, including the higher academic qualification requirements, the DH is pressing ahead with the grade structure review of Dental Hygienists in an orderly manner.

  The information on the Government Dentist and DCP grades from 2023 to 2025 is at the Annex II.

Note: Currently, dental hygienists can work in either the public or private sectors, and may perform preventive dental care in accordance with the directions of a dentist who is available in the premises at all times when such work is being carried out. Dental therapists work exclusively under the DH to provide the School Dental Care Service. Upon the commencement of the statutory registration system for DCPs, all DCPs (including dental therapists) will be allowed to provide services outside the DH (including institutions in the public or private sector)."
Hong Kong Customs detects two smuggling cases involving river trade vessels with goods worth about $29 million seized (with photo),2026-01-21 15:30,2026-01-21 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100393.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected two suspected smuggling cases involving two river trade vessels on January 5 and 8 respectively. Large batches of suspected smuggled goods with a total estimated market value of about $29 million were seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, two river trade vessels departing from Hong Kong for Macao were selected for inspection on the abovementioned dates. Upon examination, Customs officers aboard the vessels found a large batch of suspected smuggled goods, including suspected pharmaceutical products, tobacco products, bird's nest, and suspected scheduled shark fins and agarwood.

Investigations are ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Being a government department primarily responsible for tackling smuggling activities, Customs has long been combating various smuggling activities on all fronts. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on relevant crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance, any person importing, exporting or possessing specimens of endangered species not in accordance with the Ordinance commits an offence and will be liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years upon conviction with the specimens forfeited.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

答覆：

主席：

政府非常重視兒童和青少年的身心健康，透過在教育、公共衞生及醫療系統投放大量資源，提供全面的健康促進和醫療服務。

就鄧飛議員的提問，經諮詢教育局和衞生署後，現回覆如下：

（一）衞生署於二○一三年成立「使用互聯網及電子屏幕產品對健康的影響諮詢小組」，成員包括衞生署、教育局、社會福利署、香港醫學專科學院的代表，以及學者、非政府組織，並於二○一四年發表《使用互聯網及電子屏幕產品對健康的影響諮詢小組報告》，為兒童、青少年、家長和教師提供健康地使用互聯網及電子屏幕產品的建議。及後衞生署參考世界衞生組織、中國內地、新加坡、美國和澳洲等地的指引，於二○一八年更新相關使用電子屏幕產品的健康建議。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》宣布，衞生署將更新相關指引，以減少使用社交媒體對兒童及青少年健康的影響。「使用電子屏幕及社交媒體對兒童及青少年健康的影響諮詢小組」已於二○二五年十月成立，目前正檢視最新的科學證據、其他國家和地區的有關發展和經驗，以及專家意見，以期於二○二六年內就兒童及青少年使用電子屏幕及社交媒體提出更新的健康建議。

現時，衞生署學生健康服務為中小學生提供免費周年健康檢查服務，包括生長監測、視力和聽力評估、健康評估問卷等。如發現學生出現健康或行為問題（如使用電子屏幕產品時間過長），醫護人員會提供健康輔導及相關資訊（如兒童及青少年上網行為的支援服務及資訊概覽），並轉介他們到學生健康服務轄下的健康評估服務、醫院管理局轄下的專科診所、或其他合適的機構，作進一步評估和治理。

另一方面，精神健康諮詢委員會於二○二五年六月舉行的會議上討論社交媒體對兒童及青少年健康造成的影響，並支持政府更新相關健康指引。

就資助相關研究方面，優質教育基金資助提升學校教育質素及推廣優質學校教育的計劃，資助範圍涵蓋探索教育課題的研究計劃。合資格申請者可透過優先主題撥款計劃向優質教育基金提交有關的研究計劃申請。

此外，醫療衞生研究基金（基金）資助以實證為本的促進健康項目，透過提高公眾的健康意識，改變不良的健康行為和締造健康的生活環境，從而鼓勵市民採納健康的生活方式。截至二○二五年十二月，基金已資助七個與使用電子屏幕及社交媒體對兒童及青少年身心發展的影響有關的項目，當中的研究主題包括評估青少年和年輕人病態使用網絡、上網或遊戲成癮、以及過度使用智能設備的普遍性和相關風險因素及各種干預策略。

（二）及（三）面對社交媒體與互聯網普及化帶來的影響（例如虛假資訊、沉迷上網、隱私風險），教育局積極培養學生的資訊素養，並於二○二四年為學校提供《香港學生資訊素養》學習架構（學習架構），以加強中、小學課程中與資訊素養相關的學習元素，培育學生在學習及日常生活中，有效及符合道德地運用資訊及通訊科技的能力和態度、具備評估資訊與媒體內容的能力及懂得在互聯網上保護自己。學習架構以全校參與模式推展，與各學習領域有着密切的聯繫。相關的學習內容一直蘊含於中小學課程不同的課題之中，包括小學科學科、小學人文科、初中公民、經濟與社會科、高中公民與社會發展科、資訊及通訊科技科，以及價值觀教育。教育局亦持續為教師提供相關專業發展課程及教學資源，支援學校。此外，教育局委託非政府機構提供電話熱線，為有需要的教師、學生及家長提供個別支援。

（四）家庭與學校同是孩子學習和建立健康習慣的重要環境，教育局非常重視家長教育，先後在二○二二年及二○二四年推出小學及中學的《家長教育課程架構》，促進兒童／青少年健康、愉快及均衡的發展（包括促進健康使用互聯網、電子裝置和社交媒體）是其中一個主要範疇。此外，教育局每年均會聯同家庭與學校合作事宜委員會及香港教育城合辦一系列的家長講座，邀請專家和社工為家長講解課題如e世代的管教方法、資訊素養、青少年網絡文化、網上危機，以及處理子女沉迷上網的要訣等，並透過一站式家長教育資訊網頁「家長智Net」（www.parent.edu.hk）及社交媒體平台，適時發放支援學生身心發展的重要資訊，當中包括協助子女正確使用電子產品、預防兒童落入網絡陷阱及處理兒童沉迷上網的影片及文章供家長參考。"

LCQ11: Impact of social media on children and adolescents,2026-01-21 15:30,2026-01-21 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100290.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Tang Fei and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  It has been reported that the Australian Government implemented new legislation last year prohibiting the use of social media by children and adolescents under the age of 16, and non-compliant enterprises would face substantial fines; meanwhile, a number of European countries and some regions in Asia have also enacted legislation or tightened relevant restrictions one after another. Regarding the impact of social media on children and adolescents, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has plans to commission experts, scholars or higher education institutions to conduct scientific, in-depth research tailored for Hong Kong's unique social environment, so as to assess the specific impact of social media on the emotional health, personality development and academic performance of local children and adolescents; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that, and whether consideration will be given to establishing dedicated funding to support such academic research;

(2) as there are views that the Education Bureau's current recommendations on students' use of mobile phones and electronic screen products primarily focus on managing the usage time in schools, whether the Bureau has assessed the effectiveness of the current recommendations in addressing the use of electronic screen products by students outside schools and in mitigating the negative impact of social media content on students; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether consideration will be given to implementing Collaborative Research and Development (Seed) Projects or pilot schemes in some schools to adopt non-legislative approaches (such as promoting a digital health charter and strengthening home-school collaboration) on a pilot basis for managing the use of social media among students, so as to assess the practical effectiveness of such approaches in mitigating the negative impact of social media on students and provide empirical data for future policy formulation; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) given that it is difficult for schools to manage the use of social media by students after school, whether the authorities will study launching more specific guidelines for parents, with the introduction of a mechanism requiring parental consent for registration of social media accounts; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Government attaches great importance to the physical and mental health of children and adolescents, and provides comprehensive health promotion and medical services by deploying substantial resources in education, public health and medical systems.

  In consultation with the Education Bureau (EDB) and the Department of Health (DH), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Tang Fei is as follows:

(1) The DH set up the Advisory Group on Health Effects of Use of Internet and Electronic Screen Products in 2013 comprising members representing the DH, the EDB, the Social Welfare Department, the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, as well as academics and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The Advisory Group published the Report of Advisory Group on Health Effects of Use of Internet and Electronic Screen Products in 2014, which provided recommendations on the healthy use of the Internet and electronic screen products for children, adolescents, parents and teachers. With reference to the guidelines of the World Health Organization, the Chinese Mainland, Singapore, the United States and Australia, etc, the DH updated the relevant health advice on the use of electronic screen products in 2018.

  The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address announced that the DH would update the relevant guidelines to mitigate the impact of social media on the health of children and adolescents. The Advisory Group on Health Effects of Screen and Social Media Use for Children and Adolescents was established in October 2025 and is currently reviewing the latest scientific evidence as well as the relevant development and experiences in other countries and regions while consolidating expert opinions, with a view to issuing updated health recommendations on the use of electronic screens and social media by children and adolescents within 2026.

  At present, the Student Health Service (SHS) under the DH provides free annual health assessment service for primary and secondary school students, including growth monitoring, vision and hearing assessments and Health Assessment Questionnaires. Students found to have health or behavioral problems (e.g. excessive use of electronic screen products) will be provided with health counselling and relevant information (such as support services and information on the online behaviours of children and adolescents) by healthcare professionals, and will be referred to the Special Assessment Service of the SHS, specialist clinics of the Hospital Authority or other organisations as appropriate for further assessment and treatment.

  Besides, the Advisory Committee on Mental Health discussed the health impact of social media on children and adolescents at a meeting held in June 2025, and supported the Government in updating relevant health guidelines.

  As regards subsidies for relevant researches, the Quality Education Fund (QEF) funds projects that aim to raise the quality of school education and promote quality school education. The scope of funding covers research projects that explore educational topics. Eligible applicants can submit their application proposals on related researches to the QEF through the Priority Themes Funding Programme.

  Additionally, the Health and Medical Research Fund (HMRF) provides funding support to evidence-based health promotion projects that help people adopt healthier lifestyles by enhancing awareness, changing adverse health behaviours and creating a conducive environment that supports good health practices. As of December 2025, the HMRF has funded seven projects related to impacts of electronic screen and social media use on the physical and psychological development of children and adolescents, with research topics covering the evaluation of prevalence and associated risk factors for pathological Internet use, Internet or video gaming addiction and excessive smart device usage among adolescents and young adults, as well as various intervention strategies.

(2) and (3) In response to the impacts of social media and the widespread use of the Internet (e.g. misinformation, Internet addiction and privacy risks), the EDB actively cultivates students' information literacy, and provided schools with the ""Information Literacy for Hong Kong Students"" Learning Framework in 2024 to strengthen information literacy-related learning elements in primary and secondary school curricula, fostering students' ability and attitude to use information and communication technologies effectively and ethically in their studies and daily lives, enabling them to evaluate information and media content, and understand how to protect themselves online. The Learning Framework adopts a whole-school approach and is closely related to all key learning areas. Relevant learning content has been integrated into various subjects in primary and secondary school curricula, including Primary Science, Primary Humanities, Junior Secondary Citizenship, Economics and Society, Senior Secondary Citizenship and Social Development, Information and Communication Technology, as well as Values Education. The EDB also continually provides teachers with relevant professional development courses and teaching resources to support schools. Furthermore, the EDB has commissioned NGOs to provide telephone hotlines to offer individual support to teachers, students and parents in need.

(4) Home and school are key environments where children learn and develop healthy habits. The EDB attaches great importance to parent education, and introduced the Curriculum Frameworks on Parent Education for primary school and secondary schools in 2022 and 2024 respectively. One of the core strands of the Curriculum Frameworks is the promotion of healthy, happy and balanced development of children/adolescents (including facilitating healthy use of the Internet, electronic devices and social media). Besides, the EDB, the Committee on Home-School Co-operation and the Hong Kong Education City jointly organise a series of parent seminars every year, inviting experts and social workers to share with parents on topics such as parenting for the e-Generation, information literacy, youth online culture, online risks and tips for handling Internet addiction of children. The EDB also timely disseminates important messages to support the physical and psychological development of students, which include videos and articles on helping children use electronic devices properly, preventing children from falling into online pitfalls and handling Internet addiction of children through the Smart Parent Net one-stop parent education information website (www.parent.edu.hk) and its social media platforms for parents' reference."
LCQ3: Transport planning in New Territories North,2026-01-21 15:17,2026-01-21 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100234.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Yiu Ming and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

The Government has advised that it will adopt the principles of ""infrastructure-led"" and ""capacity creating"" to take forward the MTR Northern Link (NOL) Main Line and Spur Line projects, with the target of commissioning the projects in or before 2034. However, there are views that as the relevant railway infrastructures are still under construction, the completion and intake of residents for public and private housing developments one after another in New Territories North (NTN) in recent years may impose pressure on the traffic in the district. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics for the past three years on and estimated for the coming three years the population growth brought by the newly completed public and private housing developments in NTN, as well as formulated targeted short to medium term traffic contingency plans based on such data in order to meet the cross-district travel needs of the residents in the district;

(2) as it has been reported that the commissioning of Kwu Tung Station connecting NOL is expected to be advanced to 2027, whether the Government has plans to advance the commissioning of other stations along NOL in a strategic and phased manner so as to cope with the additional transport demand in the district; and

(3) in the light of the growing population in NTN, whether the Government will discuss with MTR Corporation Limited the further adjustment of the train frequency of the MTR East Rail Line, the deployment of more trains, or the introduction of passenger flow management measures so as to cope with the future increasing patronage; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government has a set of holistic transport strategies and planning principles to address the needs of the travelling public and socio-economic development through improving transportation infrastructure, enhancing public transport services and optimising road resources. In planning public transport services for individual districts, the Government takes into account a range of factors, including local development, demographic changes, transport infrastructure planning, traffic conditions and the carrying capacity and service positioning of different public transport modes. In view of the anticipated population growth in the New Territories North (NTN) (including Fanling, Sheung Shui, Kwu Tung and San Tin), the Government will make advance planning of public transport services as appropriate to meet the travelling needs of the public.

The reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Yiu Ming is as follows:

(1) Over the past three years, the newly completed housing development projects in the NTN primarily included Ching Tao Court and Choi Shek Estate in Sheung Shui, leading to a population increase of about 9 400. The Transport Department (TD) has already made several arrangements in advance under the annual route planning programmes of the franchised bus operators. The arrangements include introducing bus service between Ching Tao Court and Sheung Shui Station in September 2024 as well as launching a green minibus route between Choi Shek Estate and Shek Wu Hui in December last year.

In the next few years, the population intake of the two housing development projects in Fanling North and Kwu Tung North New Development Areas (NDAs) will commence in two phases, with the first phase from mid-2026 to 2027 accommodating an additional population of approximately 55 000 and the second phase from 2030 to 2032 accommodating about 170 000. We have formulated various measures to address the travelling needs of residents, including advance planning of short-to-medium term road works for the two NDAs based on the ""infrastructure-led"" and ""capacity creating"" principle. The works include the commissioning of the Fanling Bypass Eastern Section within this year, which will connect the Fanling North NDA directly to the Fanling Highway, thereby alleviating the traffic situation in Sheung Shui and Fanling town centres. In addition, the Government will complete several road improvement works progressively by 2031, including the construction of Po Shek Wu Road Flyover and Fanling Bypass Western Section, as well as the widening of the section of the Fanling Highway between Kwu Tung and Sheung Shui, to tie in with the intake progress of the second phase of the two NDAs concerned.

In terms of public transport services, the TD has planned to introduce a total of six new franchised bus routes in light of the first phase of intake of the two NDAs concerned. These routes will connect Kwu Tung North and Fanling North to Sheung Shui or Fanling Station as well as key community facilities within the district (such as North District Hospital). They will also include inter-district services to and from Kowloon East, Kowloon West, Tsuen Wan District and Yuen Long District. Bus routes to and from urban areas will pass through bus-bus interchanges at major tunnels to facilitate the public and residents to transfer for other districts. Relevant roads and public transport interchanges within the new development areas will also be ready by then. The TD has already briefed the North District Council on the relevant arrangements around the end of last year.

(2) and (3) On railway infrastructure development, the Government is pressing ahead with the Northern Link (NOL) Project, which is an important piece of transport infrastructure supporting the Northern Metropolis development and facilitating Hong Kong's better integration into national development. The Project comprises Kwu Tung Station on the East Rail Line (EAL), the NOL Main Line connecting the EAL and the Tuen Ma Line, as well as the NOL Spur Line connecting San Tin Station and the new Huanggang Port in Shenzhen. The construction of Kwu Tung Station on EAL has already commenced in 2023. Progress has been satisfactory thus far and the station is expected to come into operation in 2027 as scheduled, which would match the timing of major population intake of the Kwu Tung North NDA. Last year, the Government executed the Project Agreement for Part 1 of the NOL Project with the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to implement the NOL Spur Line in combination with the Main Line through an innovative mindset, substantially bringing forward the timetable of the Spur Line by two years than what was originally envisaged and achieving simultaneous commissioning with the Main Line by 2034 or earlier.

At present, we are taking forward the NOL Main Line and Spur Line on the basis of simultaneous commissioning across both lines. This mega railway project is currently in full swing. As the project progresses, we together with MTRCL would examine the feasibility of commissioning by phases. Relevant considerations include overall technical feasibility, interface with other works in the new development areas along the railway alignment, the development pace of projects along the railway alignment, and whether testing and commissioning by phases would affect the commissioning date of the remaining railway sections. We would continue to work with MTRCL towards reducing construction time, and endeavour to commission the NOL Project at an early juncture.

In summary, the Transport and Logistics Bureau and the TD will continue to monitor the population growth and passenger demand in the NTN as well as the operation of relevant public transport services to enhance services at suitable juncture to meet residents' needs. Meanwhile, we will continue to work with relevant government departments responsible for planning and development to formulate appropriate traffic and public transport service arrangements in advance.

Thank you, President."
立法會三題：新界北的交通規劃,2026-01-21 15:17,2026-01-21 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100235.htm,"​以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上姚銘議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

政府表示會以「基建先行、創造容量」的方針，推展港鐵北環線主線及支線項目，目標於二○三四年或之前通車。然而，有意見認為近年新界北陸續有公營及私營房屋落成及入伙，在有關鐵路基建尚未完成下，或會對區內交通造成壓力。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計過去三年，以及預計未來三年，新界北新落成的公營及私營房屋所帶來的人口增長，並根據該等數據，制訂針對性的短中期交通應對方案，以應付區內居民跨區出行需求；

（二）據報連接北環線的古洞站可望於二○二七年提早開通，政府有否計劃以策略性分階段的方式，提早啓用其他北環線的車站，以應對區內增加的交通需求；及

（三）因應新界北人口的持續增長，政府會否與香港鐵路有限公司商討，進一步調整港鐵東鐵線的列車班次，並加派列車或推行客流管理措施，以應對未來持續上升的乘客量；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府有一套完整的交通運輸策略和規劃原則，透過完善運輸基建、加強公共交通服務和善用道路資源，應對市民出行和社會經濟發展的需要。政府在規劃個別地區的公共交通服務時會考慮一系列因素，包括地區發展、人口變化、運輸基建規劃、交通情況，以及不同公共交通工具的運載力和服務定位等。因應新界北（包括粉嶺、上水、古洞及新田等地區）未來的人口增長，政府會預先規劃合適的公共交通配套服務，以滿足市民的出行需求。

就姚銘議員的各部分提問，現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年新界北新入伙的房屋發展項目主要包括上水的清濤苑及彩石邨，新增人口約為9 400人。運輸署已提前在專營巴士營辦商的年度路線計劃內作出規劃，包括在二○二四年九月新增巴士服務來往清濤苑及上水鐵路站，以及在去年十二月開辦一條專線小巴路線來往彩石邨及石湖墟。

未來數年，粉嶺北及古洞北兩個新發展區的房屋發展項目將分兩階段入伙，包括第一階段由二○二六年中起至二○二七年新增人口約55 000人；以及第二階段由二○三○年至二○三二年新增約170 000人。我們已制定多方面的措施，以照顧居民的出行需要，包括按照「基建先行、創造容量」的方針，及早規劃該兩個新發展區在短中期的道路工程，包括率先在今年內通車的粉嶺繞道（東段）直接連貫粉嶺北新發展區至粉嶺公路，以紓緩上水及粉嶺市中心的交通情況。此外，政府在二○三一年前會逐步完成多項道路改善工程，包括興建寶石湖路行車天橋繞道、粉嶺繞道（西段），以及擴闊古洞至上水段的粉嶺公路等，以配合該兩個新發展區第二階段的入伙進度。

在公共運輸服務方面，運輸署已因應該兩個新發展區的第一階段入伙，規劃開辦合共六條全新的專營巴士路線，接駁古洞北及粉嶺北至上水或粉嶺鐵路站，以及區内主要社區設施（例如北區醫院等）。路線亦會包括往來九龍東、九龍西、荃灣區和元朗區等的跨區服務。往返市區的巴士路線會途經主要隧道巴士轉車站，便利市民及居民換乘巴士往返其他各區。新發展區內相關道路和公共運輸交匯處屆時亦會準備就緒。運輸署已於去年年底向北區區議會匯報有關安排。

（二）及（三）鐵路基建建造方面，政府正全力推進北環線項目，作為推動北部都會區發展和助力香港更好融入國家發展的重要運輸基建。項目包括東鐵線古洞站、連接東鐵線和屯馬線的北環線主線，以及連接新田站和深圳新皇崗口岸的北環線支線。當中東鐵線古洞站已於二○二三年率先動工，目前進度良好，預計可如期於二○二七年投入服務，配合古洞北新發展區主要人口遷入的時間。政府已於去年與香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）簽訂第一部分項目協議，以創新思維合併推進北環線主線和支線工程，使支線的時間表較原先大幅提前兩年，與主線在二○三四年或之前同步開通。

目前，我們正以全線同步開通為基礎推進北環線主線和支線。這項大型鐵路工程正全力開展中，隨着工程進展，我們會與港鐵公司共同研究分階段開通的可行性。相關考慮因素包括整體技術可行性、與沿線新發展區其他工程的銜接、沿線項目的步伐，以及分段進行測試和調試會否影響其餘鐵路段的開通時間等。我們會繼續與港鐵公司致力壓縮建設時間，力爭北環線項目盡早落成。

總括而言，運輸及物流局及運輸署會持續監察新界北的人口增長和乘客需求，以及相關公共運輸服務的運作情況，適時加強服務，以配合居民的需求。與此同時，我們會繼續與負責規劃和發展的相關部門共同努力，預先制定適切的交通及公共運輸服務。

多謝主席。"

Andrew (Chairperson, Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden (KFBG), Mr Andrew McAulay), Lester (Deputy Chairman, Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Lester Huang), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is a joy to be here with you for the opening of the Jockey Club Nature Conservation Centre - and to launch Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden's milestone 70th anniversary year.

  As Andrew noted, this new Centre was made possible by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. This support is not only deeply appreciated - it is especially fitting, with the Year of the Horse arriving in just a few weeks.

  For 70 years, KFBG has continually evolved to support the government and the people of Hong Kong.

  Today, KFBG continues to broaden its mission. It builds on decades of hands-on scientific and practical nature restoration, and advises NGOs (non-governmental organisations), institutions, corporations and, of course, the Hong Kong Government.

  The Government is deeply committed to protecting Hong Kong's biodiversity and environment. Last month, we published our updated Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which reflects both global goals and our country's national strategy for conservation.

  The Plan outlines how Hong Kong will protect nature and support sustainable development over the next decade.

  I am pleased to say that KFBG played a significant role in this updated plan.

  And I should add - KFBG's forest restoration programme recently became the first in the world to receive a premium-tier certification from the Global Biodiversity Standard, underlining its global leadership in ecological restoration.

  KFBG's expertise also supports Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis Development Strategy, as we move toward better integration of urban and rural areas, and balance development and conservation.

  The new Conservation Centre is home to more than 100 scientists and other professionals, ensuring that KFBG's important work in nature conservation, sustainable living and holistic education continues to grow, and also supporting the Government, our people and the rich natural environment we are so blessed with.

  That includes more than 580 bird species, which represents one-third of our country's total, and some 6 000 marine species, around one quarter of our country's recorded total.

  Hong Kong is also home to wonderful landscapes, like the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) Global Geopark and many other conservation areas.

  In 2024, we established three major nature conservation parks. And upon the completion of the Wetland Conservation Park in the Northern Metropolis, which will be five times larger than the Hong Kong Wetland Park, we will have a vital new hub for wetland conservation.

  Nature conservation and biodiversity require constant care and collaboration. I look forward to continuing our co-operation with KFBG, the Jockey Club, scholars, researchers, environmentalists and the general public - to keep nature at the heart of Hong Kong's future.

  I wish Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden another 70 rewarding years of nature conservation and education. And I wish you all a happy and healthy New Year, full of the good fortune that our precious environment gives us. Thank you."

  Good afternoon. It is a joy to be here with you for the opening of the Jockey Club Nature Conservation Centre - and to launch Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden's milestone 70th anniversary year.

  As Andrew noted, this new Centre was made possible by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. This support is not only deeply appreciated - it is especially fitting, with the Year of the Horse arriving in just a few weeks.

  For 70 years, KFBG has continually evolved to support the government and the people of Hong Kong.

  Today, KFBG continues to broaden its mission. It builds on decades of hands-on scientific and practical nature restoration, and advises NGOs (non-governmental organisations), institutions, corporations and, of course, the Hong Kong Government.

  The Government is deeply committed to protecting Hong Kong's biodiversity and environment. Last month, we published our updated Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which reflects both global goals and our country's national strategy for conservation.

  The Plan outlines how Hong Kong will protect nature and support sustainable development over the next decade.

  I am pleased to say that KFBG played a significant role in this updated plan.

  And I should add - KFBG's forest restoration programme recently became the first in the world to receive a premium-tier certification from the Global Biodiversity Standard, underlining its global leadership in ecological restoration.

  KFBG's expertise also supports Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis Development Strategy, as we move toward better integration of urban and rural areas, and balance development and conservation.

  The new Conservation Centre is home to more than 100 scientists and other professionals, ensuring that KFBG's important work in nature conservation, sustainable living and holistic education continues to grow, and also supporting the Government, our people and the rich natural environment we are so blessed with.

  That includes more than 580 bird species, which represents one-third of our country's total, and some 6 000 marine species, around one quarter of our country's recorded total.

  Hong Kong is also home to wonderful landscapes, like the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) Global Geopark and many other conservation areas.

  In 2024, we established three major nature conservation parks. And upon the completion of the Wetland Conservation Park in the Northern Metropolis, which will be five times larger than the Hong Kong Wetland Park, we will have a vital new hub for wetland conservation.

  Nature conservation and biodiversity require constant care and collaboration. I look forward to continuing our co-operation with KFBG, the Jockey Club, scholars, researchers, environmentalists and the general public - to keep nature at the heart of Hong Kong's future.

  I wish Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden another 70 rewarding years of nature conservation and education. And I wish you all a happy and healthy New Year, full of the good fortune that our precious environment gives us. Thank you."

"Three property owners fined over $120,000 in total for not complying with removal orders",2026-01-21 15:06,2026-01-21 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100369.htm,"​Three owners were convicted and fined $127,840 in total at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts yesterday (January 20) for failing to comply with removal orders issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

The first case involved three unauthorised structures with a total area of about 63 square metres on the ground floor and rooftop of a detached house at Kwu Tung Road, Sheung Shui. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the two co-owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD and were fined $76,120 in total, of which $36,120 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued.

The second case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 43 sq m on the ground floor of a village house at Pun Shan Chau, Tai Po. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the UBWs and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the BD, a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was fined $51,720 in total, of which $21,720 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued.

A spokesman for the BD said today (January 21), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

食物安全中心公布賀年食品調查（第一期）結果（附圖）,2026-01-21 15:00,2026-01-21 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100309.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（一月二十一日）公布，最近完成一項有關賀年食品的時令食品調查（第一期），約七百七十個樣本中，除較早前公布的兩個預先包裝年糕樣本鈉含量與營養標籤上的標示值不符外，其餘樣本全部通過檢測。

中心發言人說：「農曆新年將至，中心分兩期進行是項時令食品調查。在第一期調查期間，中心從不同零售商（包括網上零售商）抽取了糕點（如蘿蔔糕和年糕）、油器（如煎堆和油角）、糖果、湯圓、果仁、瓜子、齋菜及海味等樣本進行化學、微生物及營養成分測試。」

化學檢測包括防腐劑、金屬雜質及甜味劑等。微生物檢測包括多種能引致食物中毒的致病菌。營養成分測試則檢測樣本的總脂肪、鈉和糖的含量，與其營養標籤上的標示值是否相符。

不合格食物樣本為兩個不符營養標籤規定的預先包裝年糕樣本。中心已跟進以上不合格樣本，包括通知涉事商戶有關化驗結果、指令有關商戶停售相關問題食物，以及追查問題食物來源等。

發言人提醒業界配製食品時須遵從有關法例規定，並符合「優良製造規範」，適當地使用法例准許的食物添加劑。零售商應向可靠的供應商採購食物，了解所接收物料和製成品的質素，確保其採用的材料符合法定標準。此外，業界須遵從《食物安全條例》的要求，保存良好的紀錄，以便在有需要時追查食物來源。

發言人亦建議消費者到可靠及衞生的店鋪購買賀年食物。購買預先包裝的糕點及小食時，要留意包裝是否完好和食用期限，亦應參考包裝上的營養標籤，了解食物中的糖、鈉（鹽）、飽和脂肪和反式脂肪等含量，以作出知情選擇。選購散裝食品（如糖蓮子、果仁及瓜子）時，則要注意食物容器是否清潔及店鋪員工的個人衞生情況。

發言人說：「市民應選購色澤自然的食品，留意特別亮白的開心果可能經過漂白加工，而表面有不尋常光澤的瓜子則可能添加了礦物油，食用這些食品可引致腸胃不適。」

他續說：「購買糕點後，如非即時食用，應放入雪櫃或按包裝上的說明存放，並應在食用限期前食用。就熱食的糕點，在進食前應先徹底翻熱，並盡快食用，避免長時間放於室溫。至於果仁及瓜子等食品，不可貯存過久。若發現食品發霉或有異味，便不應進食。」

發言人提醒市民保持均衡飲食，即使在新年期間，亦要盡量避免過量進食高能量、高糖分、高鹽分或高脂肪的食品。

中心會繼續對賀年食品進行檢測，並適時公布第二期的檢測結果，以確保食物安全。

立法會十八題：北大嶼山醫院的醫療服務 ,2026-01-21 15:00,2026-01-21 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100280.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

北大嶼山醫院現時有提供急症室服務，但根據政府於去年三月十九日就本人質詢的回覆，如病人在該醫院有需要接受緊急手術、或出現較複雜醫療狀況，瑪嘉烈醫院會提供支援，或安排將病人轉介瑪嘉烈醫院治理。此外，有離島區居民向本人反映，須由北大嶼山醫院轉介至瑪嘉烈醫院的病人往往須等待超過五至八小時才獲轉送和治療。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，過去三年，北大嶼山醫院有多少宗於急症室求診的病人個案需要轉介瑪嘉烈醫院進行治療，以及該等個案佔整體急症室病人數目的百分比為何；有否統計，該等轉介個案的平均等候轉介時間為何；

（二）是否知悉，醫院管理局（醫管局）會否檢討第（一）項所述的整個轉介程序，包括行政程序、診治流程和救護車安排，以及研究如何縮短病人由入院求診至接受治療時間，以及等候轉介的時間；若會，詳情（包括檢討時間表）為何；

（三）是否知悉，醫管局有否就第（一）項所述的數據進行深入分析，以評估及提升北大嶼山醫院急症室的服務能力，從而減少該院轉介病人至聯網內其他醫院數目，並減輕其他醫院的負荷；若有，詳情為何；及

（四）鑑於東涌新市鎮及其擴展區發展完成後，預計未來離島區人口將由二○二四年約19萬人增至32萬人，政府是否知悉，醫管局有何具體計劃，協助北大嶼山醫院應付預期增加的醫療需求，以及提升該院的急症服務？

答覆：

主席：

就陳學鋒議員的提問，經諮詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現回覆如下：

現時醫管局轄下十八間公立醫院設有急症服務，為病情或傷勢嚴重的人士和災難事故傷者等有緊急需要的市民提供及時的服務。為確保有緊急需要的市民能先獲得照顧，急症室實行病人分流制度，病人會根據其臨床情況被分為第一類危殆、第二類危急、第三類緊急、第四類次緊急及第五類非緊急五個類別，並按類別緩急決定治理的先後次序。

醫管局的急症服務目標定位為使前三類病人可獲即時及優先的診治，並訂明所有（即100%）危殆的病人獲即時診治，而絕大部分被分類為危急（95%）及緊急（90%）的病人在抵達急症室後15分鐘或30分鐘內應獲處理。由於急症室須調動醫護人員搶救較危急的病人，被分類為次緊急或非緊急的病人可能因此需要等候較長時間。次緊急及非緊急的病人的病情一般比較穩定及沒有生命危險，例如感染流感或腸胃不適等穩定偶發性疾病，大部分可以由家庭醫學門診或私營診所治理。

（一）至（三）醫管局採用醫院聯網為本的服務模式，加強聯網內各醫院之間的協調，讓不同定位的醫院可以互相支援、資源共用，提升運作和管理效率。聯網轄下各醫院在需要時可獲主要急症醫院在專科、人手及設施方面支援，從而更有效地照顧病人需要。

北大嶼山醫院自二○一三年九月投入服務，其於九龍西聯網的服務定位是一所社區醫院，主要為大嶼山區居民提供服務。醫院現有一百八十張病床，提供急症室服務、住院服務和日間護理服務（包括專科門診服務、社區健康中心、專職醫療服務及社康護理服務）。此外，醫院設有藥房、並提供放射診斷及病理化驗服務。

根據醫管局的資料，北大嶼山醫院急症室每年處理約七萬至八萬宗求診個案。過去三年（二○二三年至二○二五年），危殆、危急及緊急病人的平均輪候時間分別為0分鐘、7分鐘和21分鐘。次緊急及非緊急病人的平均輪候時間則分別為100分鐘和110分鐘。

在北大嶼山醫院急症室求診的病人，醫護人員均會先在北大嶼山醫院提供治理，以穩住病人情況。北大嶼山醫院作為一所社區醫院，住院服務主要包括急症科病房及延續護理病房。部分個案因需到其他專科病房作適切的治療、接受手術或深切治療，經醫生作臨床評估後會被轉介至瑪嘉烈醫院。屆時病人會按其轉介需要的緩急，再進一步分類為第一優先類別（緊急）及第二優先類別（半緊急）轉送至瑪嘉烈醫院作進一步治療。需轉介至瑪嘉烈醫院的急症病人個案平均每年約有九千至一萬宗，佔整體求診個案約12%至14%。過去三年，第一優先類別平均等候轉介時間（包括臨床評估、救護車安排及行政協調）約為20分鐘，而第二優先類別則約為119分鐘。

為進一步縮短病人等候時間並提升轉介效率，北大嶼山醫院急症室自二○二二年六月起推出「轉院定點定線計劃」。計劃針對劃分為第二優先類別、需轉至瑪嘉烈醫院且無須醫護護送轉院的個案，進一步優化轉介流程，包括優先協調救護車資源、簡化行政手續及加強與瑪嘉烈醫院的實時溝通等。符合條件的個案平均等候轉介時間縮短約三成。北大嶼山醫院急症室亦會繼續加強醫護人員的培訓，幫助他們掌握更多知識技能，更妥善照顧病人的需要。

醫管局一直密切監察醫療服務的使用率及病人輪候時間，以制定計劃提升效率及病人安全。醫管局定期與消防處檢視轉院救護車的安排；持續檢討九龍西醫院聯網內資源分配、輪候時間和轉介指標，並增加病床及專科服務名額以縮減個案轉介及等候時間。此外，醫管局亦實行聯網內互補支援機制，例如由瑪嘉烈醫院轉介病人至北大嶼山醫院的雙向轉介安排，以平衡兩院的服務需求。另外，醫管局因應長假期及服務需求高峰期啓動特別措施，包括加強人手調配和增加病床數量；亦會透過醫院指揮中心協調入院、出院及轉院等各項流程安排，務求盡量騰出病床接收新入院病人。

（四）醫管局在規劃和發展各項公營醫療服務時以醫院聯網為基礎，並會考慮一系列因素，包括人口增長和人口變化所導致的服務需求增長、慢性疾病日漸普及、科技發展、人手供應，以及各聯網的服務安排。現時，東涌屬九龍西聯網服務範圍，聯網內的五間醫院，即瑪嘉烈醫院、明愛醫院、仁濟醫院、葵涌醫院及北大嶼山醫院，為區內居民提供全面的臨床醫療服務。醫管局會因應相關地區人口的預期增長所帶來的醫療服務需求，規劃未來的醫院服務。

同時，醫管局亦致力為市民提供多元化的一站式基層醫療服務。為應對東涌人口增長所帶來的基層醫療需求，北大嶼山家庭醫學綜合中心已進一步擴大服務範圍，包括擴展預防篩查和護理服務，以幫助參加者控制慢性疾病風險因素，並及早預防慢性疾病及減少相關併發症，從而減輕急症室的負荷。醫管局會根據最新的服務需求推算，並留意九龍西聯網的醫療服務使用情況，進行聯網規劃及調整聯網服務配置，以期切合其病人（包括東涌居民）的醫療需要。"

LCQ18: Medical services at North Lantau Hospital,2026-01-21 15:00,2026-01-21 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100282.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  Currently, the North Lantau Hospital (NLTH) provides accident and emergency (A&E) services. However, according to the Government's reply to a question I raised on March 19 last year, if patients at NLTH require emergency surgeries or have complex medical conditions, either support will be provided by the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) or the patients will be transferred to PMH for further treatment. Furthermore, some residents of the Islands District have relayed to me that patients requiring transfer from NLTH to PMH often have to wait over five to eight hours before being transferred and receiving treatment. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows, in the past three years, the number of cases where patients attending the NLTH A&E department required transfer to PMH for further treatment, and the percentage of such cases in the total number of patients attending the A&E department; whether it has compiled statistics on the average waiting time for such transfers;

(2) whether it knows if the Hospital Authority (HA) will review the entire transfer process mentioned in (1), including administrative and treatment procedures and ambulance arrangements, and study ways to shorten the time from admission to treatment, as well as the waiting time for transfers; if HA will, of the details (including the timetable for review);

(3) whether it knows if HA has conducted an in-depth analysis of the data mentioned in (1) to assess and enhance the service capacity of the NLTH A&E department, thereby reducing the number of patients transferred from NLTH to other hospitals within the cluster and alleviating the burden on those hospitals; if HA has, of the details; and

(4) given that upon completion of the development of Tung Chung New Town and its extension area, the population of the Islands District is projected to increase from approximately 190 000 in 2024 to 320 000, whether the Government knows if HA has specific plans in place to assist NLTH in coping with the anticipated increase in demand for medical services and enhance the NLTH A&E services?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hok-fung is as follows:

  At present, there are 18 public hospitals under the HA with Accident and Emergency (A&E) services, providing timely services for people with urgent needs such as those who are critically ill or seriously injured and victims of disasters. To ensure people with urgent needs may receive care with priority, the A&E Departments implement a patient triage system where patients are classified into five categories, namely Category I (Critical), Category II (Emergency), Category III (Urgent), Category IV (Semi-urgent) and Category V (Non-urgent) based on their clinical conditions, and will receive treatment as prioritised by their urgency categories.

  The target of HA’s A&E services is to have the first three categories of patients receive immediate and priority treatment, and specifies that all Critical (100 per cent) patients will receive immediate treatment, and most Emergency (95 per cent) and Urgent (90 per cent) patients shall be treated within 15 or 30 minutes upon arrival at the A&E Departments. Since A&E Departments have to deploy healthcare staff to attend to more urgent patients, patients triaged as Semi‑urgent or Non‑urgent will therefore experience longer waiting times. The conditions of patients in these two categories are generally relatively stable and not life‑threatening, such as influenza infection or gastrointestinal discomfort which are stable episodic illnesses, most of these cases can be treated by Family Medicine Out-patient Services or private clinics.

(1) to (3) The HA adopts a cluster-based service model to strengthen co-ordination among hospitals within each cluster, such that hospitals with different positioning may support one another and share resources, conducive to enhancement of operation and management efficiency. Hospitals within each cluster may receive support from the major acute hospital regarding specialist services, manpower and facilities when necessary, thereby providing more effective patient care.

  The North Lantau Hospital (NLTH) commenced services in September 2013. Within the Kowloon West Cluster (KWC), NLTH is positioned as a district hospital mainly to provide services to residents on the Lantau Island. NLTH has 180 beds, providing A&E service, inpatient service as well as ambulatory care services (including specialist outpatient services, Community Health Centre, allied health services and community care services). Pharmacy, diagnostic radiology and pathology services are also provided.

  According to the HA’s data, the A&E Department of NLTH handles about 70 000 to 80 000 cases each year. In the past three years (2023 to 2025), the average waiting times for Critical, Emergency and Urgent patients were 0 minutes, 7 minutes and 21 minutes respectively. For Semi-urgent and Non-urgent patients, the average waiting times were 100 minutes and 110 minutes respectively.

  The healthcare staff in NLTH will provide patients attending the A&E Department of NLTH with initial treatment and stabilise their conditions. As a district hospital, NLTH’s inpatient services mainly include emergency medicine wards and extended care wards. Cases requiring appropriate care in other specialty wards, surgeries or intensive care would be referred to the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) after undergoing clinical assessment by doctors. By then, patients will be further categorised into Priority 1 (urgent) and Priority 2 (semi‑urgent) for transferring to PMH for further treatment, based on the urgency of the needs for referral. An average of around 9 000 to 10 000 A&E patients were referred to PMH each year, accounting for about 12 per cent to 14 per cent of total attendances. Over the past three years, the average waiting time for Priority 1 referrals (including clinical assessment, ambulance arrangement and administrative co-ordination) was around 20 minutes, while that for Priority 2 referrals was about 119 minutes.

  To further shorten patient waiting time and enhance referral efficiency, the A&E Department of NLTH has implemented the Designated Point‑to‑Point Transfer Programme (The Programme) since June 2022. The Programme targets Priority 2 cases requiring transfer to PMH without the need for escort by healthcare staff, and further streamlines the referral workflow. Measures include prioritised co-ordination of ambulance resources, streamlining administrative procedures and strengthening real‑time communication with PMH. For eligible cases, the average waiting time for transfer has been reduced by about 30 per cent. The A&E Department of NLTH will also continue to strengthen training for healthcare staff to equip them with more knowledge and skills for taking better care of patients’ needs.

  The HA has been closely monitoring healthcare service utilisation and patient waiting time to devise plans for enhancing efficiency and patient safety. The HA conducts regular reviews with the Fire Services Department on interhospital ambulance transfer arrangements; reviews resource allocation, waiting time and referral indicators within the KWC from time to time; and increases bed capacity and specialist service quotas to reduce the need for case referrals and shorten the waiting time. In addition, the HA has also implemented intra‑cluster support mechanisms, e.g. two‑way referral arrangements between PMH and NLTH to balance service demand between the two hospitals. Besides, the HA also activates special measures during long holidays and demand surge, including strengthening manpower deployment and increasing bed capacity; and co-ordinating various workflow arrangements like admission, discharge and transfer through the Hospital Command Centre so as to optimise the availability of beds for incoming patients.

(4) The HA plans and develops various public healthcare services on a cluster basis, taking into account a range of factors, including the increase in service demand as a result of population growth and demographic changes, rising prevalence of chronic diseases, technology advancement, manpower availability, as well as service arrangement of the clusters. At present, Tung Chung falls within the catchment area of the KWC, where the five hospitals, namely PMH, Caritas Medical Centre, Yan Chai Hospital, Kwai Chung Hospital and NLTH, provide a comprehensive range of clinical services to residents in the district. In planning future hospital services, the HA will take into account the increase in healthcare service demand arising from projected population growth of relevant districts.

  Meanwhile, the HA is committed to providing the public with diversified one‑stop primary healthcare services. To meet the primary healthcare needs due to population growth in Tung Chung, the North Lantau Family Medicine Integrated Centre has further expanded its service scope, including enhanced preventive screening and nursing services to help participants manage risk factors for chronic diseases, preventing chronic diseases at an early stage and reducing related complications, thereby alleviating pressure on A&E services. The HA will take reference of the latest service demand projections and monitor the utilisation of healthcare services within the KWC to undertake cluster‑level planning and adjust service provision within cluster, with a view to meeting the healthcare needs of its patients (including residents of Tung Chung)."
Centre for Food Safety announces test results of Lunar New Year food (first phase) (with photo),2026-01-21 15:00,2026-01-21 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100307.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (January 21) announced the test results of a recently completed seasonal food surveillance project on Lunar New Year (LNY) food (first phase). The test results of around 770 samples collected were satisfactory, except for two prepackaged rice cake samples found with sodium contents inconsistent with the declared values on their nutrition labels, which were announced earlier.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The LNY is coming soon, and the CFS is conducting this seasonal food surveillance project in two phases. During the first phase of the project, different types of LNY food - including steamed puddings (e.g. turnip puddings and festive cakes), fried dumplings (e.g. sesame balls and crispy triangles), candies, glutinous rice balls, nuts, melon seeds, vegetarian dishes and dried aquatic products - were collected from different retailers (including online retailers) for chemical and microbiological tests as well as nutrition content analysis.""

Chemical tests targeted preservatives, metallic contaminants, sweeteners and others. Microbiological tests covered different food poisoning pathogens. For nutrition content analysis, the contents of total fat, sodium and sugars of the samples were tested to see if the test results were consistent with the declared values on the nutrition labels.

The unsatisfactory food samples were two prepackaged rice cake samples not in compliance with the nutrition labelling regulations. The CFS has taken follow-up action on the above-mentioned unsatisfactory samples, including informing the vendors concerned of the test results, instructing them to stop selling the affected food item and tracing the source of the food items in question.

The spokesman urged the food trade to observe the relevant laws and regulations in the preparation of food, follow Good Manufacturing Practice and use permitted food additives only in an appropriate manner. Retailers should source food from reliable suppliers and conduct quality checks of incoming materials and end products to ensure that ingredients used are within legal standards. In addition, the food trade should maintain proper records in accordance with the requirements of the Food Safety Ordinance to allow source tracing if needed.

The spokesman also advised consumers to buy LNY food from reliable retailers with good hygiene conditions; make sure the packaging of prepackaged cakes and snacks is intact and the products have not expired; refer to the nutrition labels on the sugar, sodium (salt), saturated fat and trans fat content and more for making informed choices; and pay attention to the hygiene conditions of food containers and the personal hygiene of staff when buying loose-packed foods (e.g. candied lotus seeds, nuts and melon seeds).

""Consumers should choose food products with natural colours. Bright white pistachios may have been bleached, and melon seeds with an unnatural gloss may have had mineral oil added. Consumption of these food products can cause gastrointestinal discomfort,"" the spokesman said.

""Festive cakes that are not for immediate consumption should be kept refrigerated or stored according to the instructions on the package and should be eaten before they expire. Reheat hot-served festive cakes thoroughly before consumption, consume them as soon as possible, and avoid keeping them at room temperature for a long time. Foods like nuts and melon seeds should not be kept for a long time. Those with mould or an abnormal smell or taste should not be eaten,"" he added.

The spokesman reminded the public to maintain a balanced diet and, as far as practicable, avoid excessive consumption of foods high in energy, sugar, salt or fat, even during the LNY.

The CFS will continue to conduct surveillance on LNY food, and the second-phase results will be released in a timely manner to ensure food safety.

問題：

二○二五年《施政報告》提出訂立加快發展北部都會區（北都）專屬法例。其後發展局局長於去年十月在本會發展事務委員會政策簡報會上表示，希望專屬法例有主線框架，並因應北都發展需要，可能進一步訂立附屬法例。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）北都發展委員會及其轄下分別由政務司司長、財政司司長及財政司副司長所帶領的三個小組，在制定北都專屬法例上的角色及作用為何；鑑於政府表示會為北都內不同產業園區度身成立一間或多間園區公司，該三個小組和該等法定園區公司的分工和協作模式為何；

（二）除了二○二五年《施政報告》中提出北都專屬法例授權政府簡化涉及六大範疇（即（（i）成立法定園區公司；（ii）為園區公司設立專項撥款渠道以注入資金；（iii）管理指定地區跨境流動的便捷方法；（iv）加快批出建築圖則；（v）放寬各分區大綱圖的准許用途及微調發展參數；及（vi）加快繳付徵收土地的賠償）的法定程序外，政府有否計劃將該專屬法例的適用範圍擴展至涵蓋更多其他方面；由財政司司長擔任主席的北部都會區諮詢委員會會否因應專屬法例所涉及的六大範疇，調整該委員會及其轄下小組委員會的架構及職權範圍；

答覆：

主席：

二○二五年《施政報告》中指出為更好發展經濟、改善民生，北部都會區（北都）的建設務必加速推進，並要提升北都發展的決策層次，成立由行政長官領導的北都發展委員會，以及為加快北都發展訂立專屬法例等。

就簡議員提問的各部分，我回覆如下：

（一）及（四）北都發展委員會轄下設三個工作組，分別負責就北都發展的不同事宜作督導。由於北都專屬法例橫跨多個政府範疇，發展局轄下的北部都會區統籌辦事處現正統籌相關籌備工作，並就不同範疇向相關的工作組匯報情況，再向北都發展委員會作總體匯報及尋求所需指示。

成立園區公司是希望由政府主導，以更具彈性的公司運作模式吸引產業落戶，加快北都產業發展。此重要工作由財政司司長擔任組長的發展及營運模式設計組負責。其中，由政府全資擁有的洪水橋產業園有限公司獲該工作組同意後於今年一月初正式成立，為非法定公司，負責發展和營運洪水橋約23公頃產業用地。我們正全速推進各項籌備工作，以讓公司在今年年中開始運作。

（二）及（五）就北都專屬法例，政府目前的構思是在擬議法例訂明相關政策建議的主線框架，並授權行政長官會同行政會議可按需要就政策建議的落實細節進一步訂立相關的附屬法例，讓政府可以因應北都的快速發展，不斷檢視和在有需要時靈活調整落實細節，同時由立法會繼續擔當把關角色。

為北都發展制定專屬法例，旨在授權政府制訂簡化的法定程序，為北都發展進一步拆牆鬆綁，做到加快發展落實建設及促進產業進駐的兩大目標，引領香港未來經濟和社會高質量發展。我們正在制定擬議法例的詳細內容，包括涉及的範疇及目標，並會在稍後進行的公眾諮詢中公布及作諮詢。現階段立法目標未必能量化或以績效指標量度成效。

至於由財政司司長主持的北部都會區諮詢委員會與其轄下的四個小組，它們由政府及政府以外不同界別人士參與，主要是向政府就北都的整體發展以至不同範疇提供意見，稍後亦可因應其職能就北都專屬法例的草擬和執行提出意見，其運作現階段不會受北都專屬法例的範疇或內容所影響。

（三）我們計劃在今年第一季就有關擬議法例的內容展開公眾諮詢，並在今年年中向立法會提交條例草案，爭取年內完成立法工作。"
LCQ20: Dedicated legislation for Northern Metropolis,2026-01-21 14:56,2026-01-21 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100387.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Carmen Kan and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

The 2025 Policy Address proposed the introduction of dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis (NM). Subsequently, the Secretary for Development indicated at the policy briefing of the Panel on Development of this Council in October last year that there would hopefully be a main framework for the dedicated legislation, and that subsidiary legislation might be further introduced in the light of NM's development needs. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the roles and functions of the Committee on Development of the NM and its three groups respectively led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Financial Secretary (FS) and the Deputy Financial Secretary in the enactment of the dedicated legislation for the NM; given the Government's remark that one or more dedicated companies will be set up for various industrial parks within the NM, of the division of labour and collaboration model between the three groups and those statutory industry park companies;

(2) apart from the statutory procedures involving six major areas that the Government will be empowered to simplify under the dedicated legislation for the NM (i.e. (i) setting up statutory industry park companies; (ii) providing such companies with dedicated channels for funding; (iii) managing the cross-boundary flow in designated areas; (iv) speeding up the approval of building plans; (v) relaxing permitted uses in outline zoning plans and fine-tuning development parameters; and (vi) expediting compensation payment for land resumption) as proposed in the 2025 Policy Address, whether the Government has plans to extend the application of the dedicated legislation to cover more other aspects; whether the Advisory Committee on the NM chaired by the FS will adjust the structure and terms of reference of the Committee and its sub-committees in the light of the six major areas involved under the dedicated legislation;

(3) of the specific timetable for enacting the dedicated legislation for the NM (including its main framework and the subsidiary legislation involving the six major areas); whether the legislative process will be expedited and whether the relevant bill will be introduced as soon as possible; if so, of the plans; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) of the government department primarily responsible for formulating the main framework for the dedicated legislation for the NM, and the government departments planned by the Government to be empowered to enact the relevant subsidiary legislation involving the six major areas; and

(5) how the Government assesses and ascertains that the intended dedicated legislation for NM can meet NM's development needs, and whether the Government has anticipated the short, medium and long-term outcomes to be achieved by the dedicated legislation respectively; whether performance indicators will be set out for the effectiveness of the dedicated legislation; if so, of the plans; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

It is stated in the 2025 Policy Address that in order to further develop the economy and improve people's livelihood, the Government must speed up the Northern Metropolis (NM) development and raise the level of decision-making accordingly by establishing the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis under the leadership of the Chief Executive and introducing dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of the NM, etc.

My reply to various parts of the Hon Kan's question is as follows:

(1) and (4) Three working groups have been set up under the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis to supervise respective matters concerning the development of the NM. As the dedicated legislation involves a range of policy areas, the Northern Metropolis Co-ordination Office under the Development Bureau is currently co-ordinating the relevant preparatory work, and would report to the relevant working groups on different areas. An overall report would also be made to the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis and necessary steer would be sought.

The objective of establishing a park company is to attract enterprises to establish presence and accelerate development of industries in the NM under a government-led approach, while allowing more flexibility in operation under a company setting. The Working Group on Devising Development and Operation Models led by the Financial Secretary (FS) is responsible for this important task. Among others, the Hung Shui Kiu Industry Park Company Limited wholly owned by the Governmentwas established in early January this year upon endorsement by the Working Group. This is a non-statutory company responsible for the development and operation of around 23-hectare industry land in Hung Shui Kiu. The Government is moving in full steam on the preparation work for the Park Company to commence operation in mid-2026.

(2) and (5) Regarding the dedicated legislation for the NM, the Government's current thinking is to stipulate the relevant policy recommendations in the proposed legislation as a main framework, and delegate the power of further enacting relevant subsidiary legislation to the Chief Executive in Council to cover the implementation details of the policy recommendations as required. By doing so, the Government will be able to constantly review and flexibly adjust the implementation details as and when necessary in response to the rapid development of the NM, whereas the Legislative Council (LegCo) will continue to play its gatekeeping role.

The dedicated legislation for the development of the NM aims to empower the Government to devise simplified statutory procedures, further remove barriers for the development of the NM, and achieve the dual major goals of accelerating the completion of development and construction, and facilitating industry anchoring in the NM, thereby guiding Hong Kong's high-quality economic and social development in the future. We are currently formulating the details of the proposed legislation, including the areas and objectives involved, which will be announced and consulted in the upcoming public consultation. The legislative intent may not be quantified or measured by performance indicators at this stage.

Regarding the Advisory Committee on the Northern Metropolis chaired by the FS and its four sub-committees, they comprise members from the Government and various sectors outside. Their primary role is to advise the Government on the overall development and different aspects of the NM, and may raise comments on the drafting and implementation of the dedicated legislation for the NM later with regard to their purview. Their operation will not be affected by the ambit or content of the dedicated legislation for the NM at this stage.

(3) We plan to launch a public consultation on the content of the proposed legislation in the first quarter of this year and submit the bill to the LegCo in mid-2026. We will strive to complete the legislative work within this year."

LCQ8: Measures for handling retired electric vehicle batteries,2026-01-21 14:15,2026-01-21 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100225.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Pui-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that with the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EV) in Hong Kong, the volume of retired EV batteries (retired batteries) is expected to rise significantly. However, if such retired batteries are not handled properly, the hazardous substances they contain may cause serious environmental pollution and safety issues. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the annual number of retired batteries generated in Hong Kong in the past three years; the respective numbers of batteries that underwent preliminary treatment at licensed disposal facilities in Hong Kong and were exported overseas for recycling;

(2) since the launch of the ""ezbatteries"" scheme sponsored by the Recycling Fund in December 2022, of the respective annual numbers of batteries recycled and those used for second-life applications; whether the authorities have established performance indicators for the scheme and assessed its effectiveness; if so, of the specific indicators and assessment results; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as the Mainland approved early last year an action planto improve the recycling system for used new energy vehicle power batteries to further enhance the utilisation capacity of recycled power batteries, and that it is reported that many other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) have now established relatively well-developed recycling systems for retired EV batteries, whether the authorities have plans to strengthen co-operation between Hong Kong and other Mainland cities in GBA to establish a cross-border battery recycling network, with a view to enhancing resource circulation efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) as it has been reported that the technology for cascade utilisation of retired batteries (i.e. sorting, dismantling and reassembling retired batteries for application in other fields to achieve resource utilisation and environmental protection) in the Mainland is relatively mature, with over 150 ""white-listed enterprises"" (i.e. enterprises meeting the Industry Standardsfor the Comprehensive Utilization of Waste Power Storage Batteries of New Energy Vehicles) responsible for recycling and handling retired batteries, whether the authorities will subsidise or promote more relevant research and development projects to expand the application scope of cascade utilisation of retired battery in Hong Kong and foster the development of the local battery recycling industry; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) given that in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on June 8, 2022, the Government indicated that it has kept abreast of the international proposals and policies in relation to the traceability of EV batteries and is considering incorporating those arrangements that suit the local context into the relevant producer responsibility schemes, of the anticipated implementation timeline for the relevant measures on producer responsibility for retired batteries in Hong Kong, and whether such measures will cover the traceability management of EV batteries and the lawful scope of secondary-life applications for retired batteries; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The handling and disposal of retired electric vehicle (EV) batteries are regulated under the Waste Disposal Ordinance (Cap. 354) and the subsidiary Waste Disposal (Chemical Waste) (General) Regulation (Cap. 354C). Currently, EV suppliers have engaged licensed collectors to collect retired batteries from their brands' EVs. These batteries undergo proper preliminary treatment, such as sorting, discharging and insulating, before being packaged and transported overseas to appropriate treatment facilities for recycling.

  The Government started planning for the management of retired EV batteries back in 2021 when it released the Hong Kong Roadmap on Popularisation of Electric Vehicles. The measures include promoting research on the second-life use of retired EV batteries through the Green Tech Fund (GTF); pushing forward the construction of local EV battery recycling facility; and formulating the implementation of a producer responsibility scheme (PRS) on EV batteries.

  Hong Kong's first large-scale EV battery recycling facility at the EcoPark is under construction, which is expected to commence operation in the first half of 2026. This facility aims to convert retired EV batteries into recycled black mass to be supplied to the Mainland and neighbouring regions. It will not only promote the development of the EV battery recycling industry, and strengthen Hong Kong's role in the regional green industry chain, but also serve as a good model for mutually beneficial co-operation in the environmental industry of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The Government is currently consulting the trade on the operation of the PRS on EV batteries, and expects to consult the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Environmental Affairs on the implementation details within 2026.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Pui-leung is as follows:

(1) In the past three years (2022-2024), there were a total of about 160 tonnes of retired lithium batteries from vehicles preliminarily treated by local licensed disposal facilities for transporting overseas to appropriate authorised treatment facilities for recycling. A yearly breakdown is as follows:




Year
Total quantity
			(tonnes)


2022
69.5


2023
53.0


2024
38.1




  As the trade may currently store a certain quantity of retired EV batteries for further handling, the figures provided above may not fully reflect the total quantity of retired EV batteries generated by EVs in Hong Kong.

(2) In December 2022, the Recycling Fund allocated funding to launch the ""ezbatteries"" project for 24 months. By establishing a digital platform, the project offered a convenient channel for various stakeholders, including EV owners and recyclers, to learn more about the collection and recycling processes of retired EV batteries, with a view to alleviating their concerns on the handling of retired EV batteries. The project conducted a series of publicity activities, including workshops, seminars, a promotional video and electronic leaflet, to educate the trade and the public about the handling of EV batteries. As the project focuses on promotion and information sharing, it does not involve the actual recycling of retired EV batteries.

(3) In January 2025, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government established the Special Panel for Building ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" (the Special Panel) to strengthen policy co-ordination, technical exchanges and project collaboration, as well as elevate the capability in jointly handling solid waste.

  The Special Panel has commenced discussions on topics such as regional co-operation in resources circulation and waste management policy. It has been exploring ways to promote the co-ordination of regulations and market integration between the two regions, covering the potential and feasibility of cross-regional co-operation in handling different kinds of recyclable materials, including recycled black mass converted from retired EV batteries.

(4) As mentioned above, research promoting EVs and the second-life use of EV batteries are listed under the priority theme of green transport under the GTF. At present, the GTF has approved three research and development projects related to the recycling of retired EV batteries, covering application areas such as echelon use of EV batteries, involving a total grant of over $12 million.

(5) As mentioned above, the Government is currently consulting the trade on the PRS on EV batteries. This includes considerations for establishing a product traceability system and repurposing retired batteries in good condition for echelon use. The Government will consult the LegCo Panel on Environmental Affairs on the PRS on EV batteries within 2026."
立法會八題：處理電動車退役電池的措施,2026-01-21 14:15,2026-01-21 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100217.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上陳沛良議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見指出，隨着電動車在香港日益普及，預計電動車退役電池（退役電池）數量將大幅增加。然而，若該等退役電池未有妥善處理，當中的有害物質有可能造成嚴重的環境污染和安全問題。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，本港每年產生的退役電池數目為何；經本港持牌處置設施初步處理及運往外地回收再造的電池數目分別為何；

（二）由回收基金贊助的「易收鋰」計劃自二○二二年十二月推出以來，每年回收及用作二次應用的電池數目分別為何；當局有否就該計劃訂立績效指標，以及評估該計劃的成效；如有，具體指標及評估結果為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於內地在去年初通過《健全新能源汽車動力電池回收利用體系行動方案》，進一步提升回收動力電池的利用能力，而據報不少粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）其他內地城市目前已建立較完善的電動車退役電池回收體系，當局有否計劃加強本港與大灣區其他內地城市合作，建立跨境電池回收網絡，以提升資源循環效率；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四）據報內地退役電池的梯次利用技術（即將退役電池進行篩選、拆解及重組後，應用於其他領域，以實現資源化利用和環境保護）已相對成熟，已有超過150家「白名單企業」（即符合《新能源汽車廢舊動力蓄電池綜合利用行業規範條件》的企業）負責回收處理退役電池，當局會否資助或推動更多相關科研項目，擴大本港退役電池梯次利用的應用範疇，並推動本港退役電池回收業的發展；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）鑑於政府於二○二二年六月八日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，政府有留意國際間電動車電池追蹤溯源方面的建議和政策，並考慮將適合本地的相關規定納入相關的生產者責任計劃，本港就退役電池生產者責任的相關措施的預計落實時間為何，以及該等措施會否涵蓋電動車電池溯源管理、退役電池二次應用範疇的合法範圍等；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

處置及棄置電動車退役電池均受《廢物處置條例》（第354章）及附屬的《廢物處置（化學廢物）（一般）規例》（第354C章）所規管。現時，電動車供應商均有聘請持牌收集商收集其品牌電動車的退役電池，並經適當初步處理（如分類、放電、絕緣）及包裝後，再運往外地合適處置設施循環再造。

政府早在二○二一年發表《香港電動車普及化路線圖》時，已開始就如何處理電動車退役電池作出部署，措施包括透過低碳綠色科研基金推動電動車退役電池二次應用的研究，引進本地建設電動車電池回收設施，以及籌劃實施電動車電池生產者責任計劃。

全港首間大型電動車電池回收設施已在環保園建設中，相關公司預計二○二六年上半年可以啓用，將退役電池轉化為再生黑粉供應內地和周邊地區。有關回收設施不但有助促進電動車電池回收產業發展，提升香港在區域綠色產業鏈的角色，更為粵港澳大灣區環保產業的互利合作提供良好示範。政府亦正就電動車電池生產者責任計劃的運作諮詢業界，預計在二○二六年內就實施細節諮詢立法會環境事務委員會。

就陳沛良議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年（二○二二年至二○二四年），經本地持牌處置設施初步處理後運往外地認可合適處置設施循環再造的車用退役鋰電池合共約160公噸，按年分項數字如下：




年份
總量（公噸）


二○二二
69.5


二○二三
53.0


二○二四
38.1




由於業界現時可能會儲存到一定數量的退役電池再進行處理，因此上述數字未必完全反映本港電動車所產生的退役電池數量。

（二）回收基金於二○二二年十二月撥款推行為期24個月的「易收鋰」項目，透過建立一個電子平台，為電動車車主、回收商等不同持份者提供便捷的渠道，協助他們了解更多有關收集和回收電動車退役電池的資訊，以釋除他們對如何處理電動車退役電池的疑慮。項目舉辦了一系列宣傳活動，包括工作坊和講座、宣傳片及電子單張，向業界及公眾推廣電動車電池處理知識。由於項目的性質是宣傳和資料分享，不涉及具體回收電動車退役電池。

（三）香港特別行政區政府與廣東省政府於二○二五年一月成立「無廢灣區」建設專題小組（專題小組），以加強政策對接、技術交流與專案協作，提升固體廢物協同處置能力。

專題小組已就區域性資源循環合作、廢物管理政策等議題展開討論，並正商討推動兩地法規協調和市場對接，以及跨區協同處置不同回收物料的空間和可行性，包括由退役電動車電池轉化的再生黑粉原料。

（四）如上述，推廣電動車及電動車電池二次應用的研究，已被列為低碳綠色科研基金下綠色運輸的優先研究主題。基金至今已批出三個與回收退役電動車電池相關的科研項目，涵蓋電動車電池梯次利用等應用範疇，涉及撥款超過1,200萬元。

（五）如上述，政府正就電動車電池生產者責任計劃諮詢業界，內容包括可否建立產品溯源系統和把狀態理想的退役電池作梯次利用。政府會在二○二六年內就電動車電池生產者責任計劃諮詢立法會環境事務委員會。"
立法會十六題：「跨境一鎖計劃」,2026-01-21 14:10,2026-01-21 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100306.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上嚴剛議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

香港海關與內地海關自二○一六年正式推行「跨境一鎖計劃」（該計劃），透過應用同一把電子鎖及全球定位系統設備，減少同一批貨物在兩地入境及出境時被重複檢查的機會，簡化清關手續，現時清關點已增至93個。有意見指出，該計劃顯著提升通關效率，並強化香港作為國際航空樞紐的轉運功能，鞏固其「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的樞紐地位。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於閩粵港「跨境一鎖」快速通關模式於二○二四年七月成功開通，實現廈門貨物直達香港國際機場，政府會否與內地部門商討在內地增設更多清關點，以增加該計劃的覆蓋面；

（二）鑑於珠海機場空港國際智慧物流園於去年六月正式投入運作，為進一步提升珠海機場與香港國際機場貨運連接，政府有否計劃與內地部門商討，將珠海機場納入該計劃的清關網絡；政府如何在推行該計劃時，與珠海方面協調升級貨運口岸的空運設施，從而提升港珠跨境貨運專線貨運效率和能力；及

（三）政府會否在該計劃的基礎上，進一步與內地合作提升粵港澳大灣區各清關點的空運服務功能，從而鞏固香港作為國際物流樞紐的領先地位？

答覆：

主席：

就嚴剛議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）香港海關與內地海關一直積極擴展「跨境一鎖計劃」的覆蓋範圍。現時計劃共有超過90個清關點，包括香港的13個清關點，廣東省的65個清關點、湖南省的四個清關點、福建省的七個清關點及澳門的四個清關點。兩地海關正籌備把計劃延伸至廣西壯族自治區，為貨運及物流業界提供更多路線選擇。

香港海關會繼續與香港貨運及物流業界保持緊密溝通，包括透過「便利轉運貨物清關業界諮詢小組」的定期會議和舉辦研討會，讓業界進一步認識「跨境一鎖計劃」，並適時向內地海關反映業界的意見及業務需要，包括於內地增設更多清關點的建議。現時，珠海機場並不是計劃下的清關點。

（三）在「跨境一鎖計劃」之外，政府和香港機場管理局正積極發展香港國際機場與東莞之間的「海空貨物聯運」模式，並推進香港國際機場東莞空港中心建設，增加進出內地貨物使用香港空運服務。內地出口貨物在東莞空港中心完成安檢和收貨，可經海路無縫運達香港國際機場，直接轉運海外；國際空運貨物亦可按上述相反路線進口內地。此模式將為粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）貨物提供更無縫、便捷的國際空運網絡，提升貨物轉運效率。政府會積極與內地當局合作，探討不同創新便利方案，優化大灣區的多式聯運連接，鞏固香港作為國際航空樞紐及國際物流樞紐的領先地位。"
LCQ16: Single E-lock Scheme,2026-01-21 14:10,2026-01-21 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100308.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Erik Yim and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

 The Customs and Excise Department officially launched the Single E-lock Scheme (SELS) together with the Mainland Customs since 2016, applying one single e-lock and the technology of global positioning system to reduce duplicate inspection on the same shipment by both Customs authorities at the boundary, thereby streamlining the clearance process. Currently, the number of clearance points has increased to 93. There are views pointing out that the SELS has significantly enhanced clearance efficiency and strengthened the transhipment function of Hong Kong as an international aviation hub, reinforcing its hub status of being ""backed by the motherland and connected to the world"". In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Fujian-Guangdong-Hong Kong SELS was officially launched in July 2024 to realise Xiamen cargo arriving at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) directly, whether the Government will discuss with the Mainland authorities the establishment of more clearance points on the Mainland to expand the coverage of the SELS;

(2) given that the Zhuhai Airport International Intelligent Logistics Park officially commenced operations in June last year to further enhance the cargo connectivity between the Zhuhai Airport and the HKIA, whether the Government has plans to discuss with the Mainland authorities the inclusion of the Zhuhai Airport in the SELS's customs clearance network; how the Government will co-ordinate with the Zhuhai authorities to upgrade air cargo facilities at cargo ports in implementing the SELS, thereby enhancing the efficiency and capacity of the dedicated Hong Kong-Zhuhai cross-boundary cargo route; and

(3) whether it will, on the basis of the SELS, further collaborate with the Mainland to enhance the functions of air cargo services at the various clearance points across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's leading position as an international logistics hub?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Transport and Logistics Bureau, our reply to the Hon Erik Yim's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) has been actively extending the coverage of the Single E-lock Scheme with the Mainland Customs. Currently, the Scheme covers over 90 clearance points, including 13 in Hong Kong, 65 in Guangdong Province, four in Hunan Province, seven in Fujian Province and four in Macao. The two Customs authorities are preparing to extend the Scheme to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, providing the cargo freight and logistics sectors with more route options.

 The C&ED will continue to closely liaise with cargo freight and logistics sectors of Hong Kong through regular meetings with the Transshipment Cargo Clearance Facilitation Customer Liaison Group and organising seminars to enable the industry to better understand the Scheme. The C&ED would relay the industry's views and business needs to the Mainland Customs, including establishment of additional clearance points in the Mainland. At present, Zhuhai Airport is not a clearance point under the Scheme.

(3) In addition to the Scheme, the Government and the Airport Authority Hong Kong are actively developing the sea-air intermodal cargo transshipment mode between the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and Dongguan, and taking forward the construction of the HKIA Dongguan Logistics Park, to boost the use of Hong Kong air cargo services for transporting goods to and from the Mainland. Export cargo from the Mainland can go through security screening and cargo acceptance in the HKIA Dongguan Logistics Park and then be transported seamlessly by sea to the HKIA for direct transshipment to overseas destinations. International air cargo may also be imported into the Mainland through the reverse process. This mode will allow cargo in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to be transported through a more seamless and convenient international air network and improve the efficiency of air cargo transshipment. The Government will actively co-operate with the Mainland authorities, explore various innovative facilitation schemes and enhance multimodal connectivity within the GBA, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's leading position as an international aviation hub and international logistics hub."

立法會二題：推進人工智能在各行業的深度應用,2026-01-21 13:15,2026-01-21 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100299.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上陳祖恒議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的答覆：

問題：

 國家二○二五年《政府工作報告》指明要「持續推進『人工智能+』（AI+）行動」。而去年《施政報告》強調推進AI+發展，促進AI在各行業的廣泛深度融合和應用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有何具體策略長遠推動AI廣泛應用，支援紡織業等獲國家「十五五」規劃建議支持優化提升的傳統優勢產業數字化轉型；

（二）鑑於有業界建議當局整合、善用和優化現有與AI相關的資助計劃，以支援傳統優勢產業（尤其是中小企）應用AI轉型，當局會否考慮相關建議，為現有與AI相關的資助計劃推出優化措施和增加資助，鼓勵企業應用AI提升競爭力；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）如何應用AI+策略，提升電子政府服務的跨部門服務質量和效率及數據互通應用水平，例如在企業版「智方便」應用AI，以直接識別該企業適用的資助計劃和電子政府服務，並自動協助該企業用戶處理申請，從而幫助不同規模的企業降低營運成本，加速傳統優勢產業提質升級？

答覆：

主席：

人工智能（AI）是香港的核心產業之一。過去數年，我們循着《香港創新科技發展藍圖》的策略，積極建設本地AI生態圈，以「強化基礎設施、促進應用導向」為重心，完善上、中、下游的聯動，全力推動香港AI多維度發展。此發展路向亦與國家提出的「人工智能+」行動一脈相承。

就陳祖恒議員的提問，我現回覆如下。

（一）政府就AI的系統布局，涵蓋科研、算力、數據、人才以及資金等領域，為香港深化實踐「人工智能+」行動和更好地支持及服務國家「十五五」時期高質量發展大局，提供了有力支撐。其中，二○二五年《施政報告》提出大力拓展AI應用，以AI賦能產業，實現「AI產業化、產業AI化」，正是我們明確的AI+行動綱領。本地科技園區聚集近千家AI相關的企業亦在過程中提供強大動力。

以陳議員提及包括紡織業在內的傳統產業為例，香港生產力促進局設立香港工業人工智能及機械人研發中心，專注發展工業AI和機械人技術及商品化。中心正在開發的項目涵蓋AI在製造業各層面的應用，例如物流、自動化組裝以及產品質量檢測等。

此外，政府一直透過「創新及科技基金」（基金）協助傳統優勢產業邁向數碼化轉型及智能升級。截至去年年底，基金已累計批出超過14億元資助有關AI的項目，加強製造業的競爭力與創新能力。與此同時，基金已資助超過350個、總額約10億元與AI相關的項目，推動AI技術的應用研發及技術轉移。

（二）「產業AI化」須由市場需求及應用場景帶動，才能把香港優秀的科研成果落到實處。「創新及科技基金」轄下的多項資助計劃覆蓋廣泛，為不同行業及企業各個發展階段的需要提供不同程度的技術和財政支援，更能靈活對應市場或企業對創新科技（包括AI）的需求，滿足科技變革及千行百業的應用場景。

除此之外，針對企業對加快數碼轉型、善用AI的殷切需求，政府致力優化現有與AI相關的資助計劃。例如「新型工業化資助計劃」已於去年六月優化，加快項目審批，支持企業善用科技（包括AI）升級轉型，至今已支持超過120條智能生產線。另外，「數碼轉型支援先導計劃」亦將加入AI及網絡安全數碼方案，鼓勵中小企應用AI提升競爭力。我們正草擬新一輪計劃的資助範圍和執行細節，預計於本年度內諮詢立法會。

（三）二○二五年《施政報告》提出成立的AI效能提升組會用好統籌協調的力量，指導政府部門於工作中有效應用人工智能技術、研究重組工作流程以及推動部門進行科技革新；並在不同政務環節推出數據分析、客戶服務及文書工作等通用AI工具，以提升效能，並更好地回應市民對高效政府和優質公共服務的期望。過程中，政府會與業界攜手合作，利用AI提供更優質、利民和便商的公共服務。AI效能提升組的目標是於在二○二六年內推出涵蓋100個政務環節的AI工具，並在二○二七年底前增加至不少於200個；以及在二○二六至二七及二○二七至二八年度內陸續推出AI旗艦項目，利用AI輔助部門加快處理及審批各類牌照和申請。

此外，數字政策辦公室會為「智方便」及「數碼企業身份」這兩個分別面向市民及企業的政府跨部門統一電子服務平台，提供「AI助手」，以用戶需求及數據為本，利用AI快捷地解答用戶查詢及提供個人化服務，當中「數碼企業身份」會為企業（特別是中小企）推薦合適的資助計劃和公共服務支援，協助企業降低營運成本。我們預期於今年內陸續推出上述電子服務優化措施。"

Question:

  The country's 2025 Report on the Work of the Government highlights the need to ""continuously advance the 'Artificial Intelligence Plus' (AI+) Initiative"", while last year's Policy Address emphasised promoting the development of AI+ and facilitating the extensive and deep integration and application of AI across different sectors. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific strategies to promote the extensive application of AI in the long run for supporting the digital transformation of traditional industries with competitive edge, such as the textiles industry, for which the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan have expressed support for upgrading;

(2) given that some members of the industry suggest that the authorities should consolidate, leverage and enhance the existing AI-related funding schemes, with a view to supporting traditional industries with competitive edge (particularly small and medium enterprises) in achieving transformation through the application of AI, whether the authorities will consider the relevant suggestions by introducing enhancement measures and increasing funding for the existing funding schemes, so as to encourage enterprises to enhance competitiveness through the application of AI; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the ways to leverage the AI+ strategy to enhance the cross-departmental service quality and efficiency of electronic government services (e-government services) as well as the level of data interoperability and application, such as applying AI in the business version of ""iAM Smart"" to directly identify funding schemes and e-government services applicable to an enterprise, and automatically assist the corporate user concerned in processing applications, thereby facilitating enterprises of different sizes to reduce operating costs and accelerating the service upgrade of traditional industries with competitive edge?

Reply:

President:

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of Hong Kong's core industries. Over the past few years, pursuant to the strategy set out in the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint, we have been actively building a local AI ecosystem, focusing on ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"" to enhance the synergy among the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors, and to fully drive Hong Kong's AI development on multiple dimensions. This development direction is also in line with the national ""AI+"" initiative.

  In response to the question from the Hon Sunny Tan, my reply is as follows.

(1) The Government's systematic AI framework, covering scientific research, computing power, data, talent and funding, provides strong support for Hong Kong to deepen its implementation of the ""AI+"" initiative and to better support and serve the national high-quality development agenda during the National 15th Five-Year Plan period. In particular, the 2025 Policy Address advocated stepping up promotion of AI applications with a view to achieving ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"", which is precisely our ""AI+"" action agenda. The local technology parks which have attracted nearly 1 000 AI-related enterprises, have also provided significant momentum in the process.

  Taking traditional industries such as the textile industry as mentioned by the Hon Tan as an example, the Hong Kong Productivity Council has established the Hong Kong Industrial Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Centre, focusing on the development of industrial AI and robotics technologies and commercialisation. Projects currently being developed by the Centre cover AI application in various facets of the manufacturing industry, such as logistics, automated assembly, and inspection of product quality.

  Separately, the Government has been supporting traditional industries with competitive advantages in their digital transformation and smart upgrades through the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF). As of the end of last year, ITF has approved funding of over $1.4 billion for AI-related projects, strengthening the manufacturing sector's competitiveness and innovation capacity. At the same time, ITF has already funded more than 350 AI-related projects involving a total funding amount of around $1 billion to promote research and development (R&D) on AI application and AI technology transfer.

(2) ""AI for industries"" ought to be driven by market demand and application scenarios to put Hong Kong's excellent R&D outcomes into practice. The scope of the various funding schemes under the ITF are comprehensive, providing different levels of technical and financial support to meet the needs of various industries and enterprises at different stages of development. They can also flexibly respond to the demands from the market or enterprises for innovation technologies (including AI), catering for technological change and application scenarios of different sectors.

  In addition, to meet the pressing needs of enterprises for accelerating digital transformation and leveraging AI, the Government is committed to enhancing existing AI-related subsidy schemes. For example, the New Industrialisation Funding Scheme was enhanced in June last year to speed up the process of project approvals, supporting enterprises in leveraging technologies (including AI) for upgrading and transformation. The Scheme has supported over 120 smart production lines so far. Separately, the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme will include AI and cybersecurity digital solutions to encourage small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to use AI to enhance their competitiveness. We are currently drafting the scope of subsidies and implementation details for the new round of the programme, and expect to consult the Legislative Council within this year.

(3) The AI Efficacy Enhancement Team (AIEET) established per the 2025 Policy Address will leverage its planning and co-ordinating power to steer departments in effectively applying AI technologies in their work, exploring process re-engineering, and promoting technological reform in departments. Coupled with the launching of common AI tools over various government functions such as data analysis, customer service and document processing, overall efficacy will be enhanced, thereby better meeting public expectations for efficient administration and quality public services. In the process, the Government will work hand in hand with the industry to leverage AI to provide higher-quality public services that benefit the public and make it easier for businesses. The AIEET targets to launch AI tools covering 100 public administration procedures within 2026, and to expand to no fewer than 200 by end-2027. In addition, AI flagship projects will be rolled out progressively in 2026-27 and 2027-28 to use AI to assist departments in expediting the processes of handling, vetting and approval of various types of licences and permits, as well as applications.

  Additionally, the Digital Policy Office will provide ""AI Assistant"" for ""iAM Smart"" and ""Digital Corporate Identity (CorpID)"", the Government's interdepartmental unified electronic service platforms for the general public and businesses respectively. Based on users' needs and data, the AI Assistant will quickly answer users' enquiries and provide personalised services. In particular, the CorpID will recommend suitable subsidy schemes and public service support to enterprises (especially SMEs), helping them reduce operating costs. We expect to implement the above e-service enhancement measures gradually within this year."
立法會十三題：推廣樂齡科技的應用,2026-01-21 12:45,2026-01-21 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100238.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上鄧家彪議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉香港社會對「以老護老」的「雙老」家庭、「以殘護老」及「以老護殘」家庭的關注持續提升。行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》中提及會為300户高風險住户安裝智能意外偵測系統（偵測系統），以及時發覺高風險長者的危險情況。此外，據報坊間也有團體與企業合作為長者住户安裝樂齡科技產品。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（八）除了偵測系統及訊息系統外，政府有否考慮進一步直接為長者免費提供其他具實用性的樂齡科技產品；如有，有否估計需增撥的金額為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府透過多項措施致力加強支援照顧者和推廣樂齡科技的應用，包括向低收入家庭的照顧者提供照顧者津貼、加強暫託服務，以及設立專項基金，加強以樂齡科技服務有需要的群體等。就問題的八個部分，勞工及福利局（勞福局）經諮詢房屋局、香港房屋委員會（房委會）和香港房屋協會（房協）後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（八）照顧者是長者和殘疾人士在社區生活的重要支撐。勞福局致力支援護老者和殘疾人士照顧者，以減輕他們的身心壓力，同時為被照顧者提供更全面的照料。作為加強支援照顧者的其中一環，勞福局正按二○二五年《施政報告》所述，計劃為300‍戶高風險照顧者住戶試行安裝智能意外偵測系統。

勞福局期望在試行計劃下，透過科技應用，在照顧者及／或被照顧者遇上家居意外時，達致即時偵測、及早介入、迅速援助的效果。勞福局正積極進行籌備工作，預計最快二○二六年第一季公布具體安排，並為相關住戶試行安裝系統，爭取二○二六年第三季或之前為不少於300戶住戶完成安裝。

此外，政府二○一八年十二月以十億元設立「樂齡及康復創科應用基金」（基金），資助合資格安老及康復服務單位購置、租用或試用科技產品，以改善服務使用者的生活，並減輕護理人員及照顧者的負擔和壓力。二○二四至二五年度，政府向基金額外注資十億元，並擴闊其用途至適合家居使用的樂齡科技產品。至二○二五年十二月，基金合共批出超過9.1億元，資助約2100個安老及康復服務單位購置或租用合共超過27000項科技產品。

社會福利署（社署）二○二三年九月把「長者社區照顧服務券計劃」的適用範圍擴展至租用輔助科技產品，進一步促進樂齡科技應用於長者社區照顧服務。

在公共屋邨方面，房屋署除推行「物聯網長者住戶大門開關訊息系統」試行計劃外，亦積極探索新科技在樂齡安居方面的應用。例如，在部分屋邨的暢通易達洗手間以試點形式安裝智能監測跌倒系統，以偵測跌倒、暈厥或停留過久等情況。房委會也與香港警務處協作推廣「智蹤計劃」，推動高危長者使用定位裝置，預防走失及減輕其照顧者和家人的壓力。房屋署會繼續與其他政府部門及社福機構探討推行其他樂齡科技的可行性，以惠及更多長者住戶。房委會和房協亦會持續探討在其轄下出租屋邨應用更多智能技術方案，例如研究使用機械人協助搬運重物，以加強對長者住戶的支援。

（二）至（四）房委會向沒有領取綜合社會保障援助（綜援）的合資格長者住戶提供津貼安裝緊急警報系統（又名「平安鐘」），讓有需要長者在遇到緊急事故時可以迅速求助。房委會已將緊急警報系統津貼的應用範圍由傳統的緊急警報系統擴展至流動式的緊急警報系統，例如具備緊急警報系統的手機和手錶及具有安裝偵測跌倒功能的產品。長者住戶可自行選購，成功申請後會按實報實銷的方式，獲發一次性不超過2,500元的津貼。至二○二五年十一月底，房委會已批出超過26000宗申請。房委會並無備存申請者的年齡分布及所屬地區的分項統計。

另一方面，65歲或以上的綜援受助長者，如屬單身或與家人同住但乏人妥善照顧，可向社署申請特別津貼，支付安裝及使用室內或流動緊急召援系統的費用。60至64歲的綜援受助人，如屬單身或與家人同住但乏人妥善照顧，同時經公立醫院或診所醫生證明殘疾程度超過50%，或證明所患疾病有可能對生命構成威脅而需要他人即時援助，也可向社署申請相同特別津貼。

二○二○至二一至二○二四至二五年度，領取緊急召援系統津貼的綜援受助人數由32745人減至25543人，綜援長者個案數目亦由128863宗減少至110846宗。綜援受助人按自身情況決定是否申請緊急召援系統津貼，原因各有不同，不一而足。社署轄下社會保障辦事處職員會向合資格的綜援受助人介紹有關津貼，並協助他們申請。除綜援提供的津貼外，社會上不同機構也有向綜援人士提供類似的緊急警報系統援助。

社署沒有就綜援計劃下提供的緊急召援系統津貼指定任何供應商，有需要綜援人士可按其需求自行選購合適的緊急召援系統。另外，在「地區服務及關愛隊伍－支援長者及照顧者先導計劃」下，政府資助由關愛隊轉介的合資格長者及殘疾人士安裝及使用緊急召援服務。該服務由社署根據採購程序委聘的機構提供。社署根據服務合約監察相關服務的提供情況，並適時檢視及優化服務。

（五）至（七）房委會一直秉持「關懷為本」及與時並進的信念，積極探討便利長者的措施，應用創新科技多方面照顧長者住戶的需要。房委會二○二五年四月在觀塘區雲漢邨及何文田常樂邨開展「物聯網長者住戶大門開關訊息系統」試行計劃，為自願參與的長者住戶安裝系統，讓他們指定的親友，掌握有關長者進出居所的情況，及時提供適切支援。房委會亦可透過後台定期統計數據。有關計劃仍在試用階段，至今共有55戶獨居長者自願參與。至二○二五年十二月底，系統共發出四次長時間未開關大門的訊息，原因包括住戶遠行及住院後未停用感應器，並無涉及意外。

視乎住戶的參與情況及在資源許可下，房屋署會挑選合適的屋邨，擴展試行計劃並同步接收大門開關的訊息。房屋署會積極研究與其他政府部門及社福機構推行其他類似計劃的可行性，以推展至其他公共屋邨，惠及更多長者住戶。

過去五年（二○二一年至二○二五年十一月），在房委會轄下公共租住房屋單位內自然身故的個案數目載列如下。房屋署沒有備存相關人士的年齡、所屬地區或有否安裝緊急警報系統的分項統計。

LCQ 13: Promoting application of gerontechnology,2026-01-21 12:45,2026-01-21 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100245.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Tang Ka-piu and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

It is learnt that there has been continued concern in Hong Kong society about families of elderly doubletons featuring ""the elderly taking care of the elderly"" as well as families with ""persons with disabilities taking care of elderly persons"" and families with ""elderly persons taking care of persons with disabilities"". The Chief Executive mentioned in the 2025 Policy Address that an intelligent accident detection system (detection system) would be installed for 300 high-risk households to detect dangerous situations involving high-risk elderly persons in a timely manner. In addition, it has been reported that some organisations have collaborated with enterprises in the community to install gerontechnology products for elderly households. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has set a timetable for installing the detection system for those high-risk households; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) of the number of households currently applying for the Housing Department's Grant for Emergency Alarm System (EAS Grant), with a breakdown by the number of elderly tenants in the relevant units, their districts of residence and age groups (each covering five years);

(3) given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025-2026, the Government indicated that the number of recipients of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme receiving the EAS Grant had gradually decreased from the 2020-2021 financial year to the 2024-2025 financial year, whether the Government has studied the reasons for the decrease in the number of recipients;

(4) whether it has conducted performance assessments of organisations currently providing EAS (commonly known as ""ping on bell"") service; if so, of the standard of service provided by various organisations; if not, whether the Government will consider conducting such assessments of those organisations;

(5) of the number of households that have installed the Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households (the sensor system) to date, with a breakdown by the number of elderly tenants in the relevant units and their districts of residence;

(6) whether the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) may receive the alerts issued by the sensor system simultaneously; if so, of the number of alerts issued by the sensor system to date, with a breakdown by the reasons for issuing alerts; if not, whether the Government will consider allowing HA to receive the relevant alerts simultaneously in the future;

(7) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of cases where elderly persons were found dead at home in the past five years, with a tabulated breakdown by their districts of residence, whether ""ping on bell"" was installed and the level of impairment under the Standardized Care Need Assessment Mechanism for Elderly Services; and

(8) apart from the detection system and the sensor system, whether the Government has considered further providing other practical gerontechnology products for elderly persons directly for free; if so, whether it has estimated the additional funding required; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government strives to strengthen support for carers and promote the application of gerontechnology through various measures, including providing carers' allowance to carers from low-income families, enhancing respite services, as well as establishing a dedicated fund to foster the use of gerontechnology to serve the needy. The Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), after consulting the Housing Bureau, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), gives the following consolidated reply to the eight parts of the question:

(1)and (8)Carers play an important role in supporting elderly persons and persons with disabilities living in the community. The LWB is committed to supporting carers of elderly persons and persons with disabilities, with a view to alleviating their physical and mental stress, and at the same time providing care recipients with more comprehensive care. As part of the bigger effort to strengthen support for carers, the LWB is, in accordance with the 2025 Policy Address, planning to launch a pilot scheme to install intelligent accident detection systems for 300 high-risk carer households.

The LWB hopes to achieve in this pilot scheme, through the application of technology, immediate detection, timely intervention, and prompt assistance whenever home accidents befall carers and/or their care recipients. The LWB is actively undertaking preparatory work and expects to announce the detailed arrangements in the first quarter of 2026 at the earliest, followed by installation of systems for relevant households. We aim to complete such installation for no fewer than 300 households by or before the third quarter of 2026.

In addition, the Government set up the $1 billion Innovation and Technology Fund for Application in Elderly and Rehabilitation Care (the Fund) in December 2018 to subsidise eligible elderly and rehabilitation service units to procure, rent or trial technology products, so as to improve the quality of life of service users and reduce the burden and pressure of care staff and carers. In 2024-25, the Government injected additional $1 billion into the Fund and expanded its scope to cover technology products suitable for household use. As at December 2025, the Fund had allocated a total of about $910 million, subsidising about 2 100 elderly and rehabilitation service units to procure or rent over 27 000 technology products.

The Social Welfare Department (SWD) expanded the scope of the Community Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly in September 2023 to cover rental of assistive technology products, thus further catalysing the use of gerontechnology in community care services for elderly persons.

As for the public rental housing (PRH) estates, apart from the Internet of Things (IoT) Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households (the Scheme), the HD is actively exploring the use of new technologies in promoting elderly-friendly living. For instance, the HD has piloted the installation of smart fall-detection systems in some accessible toilets of some PRH estates to detect incidents such as falls, fainting, prolonged inactivity, etc. The HKHA has also collaborated with the Hong Kong Police Force to promote the Project PINPOINT which encourages the use of location devices for high-risk elderly individuals so as to prevent the elderly from missing and alleviating the stress of their carers and families. The HD will continue exploring the feasibility of implementing other gerontechnologies with other government departments and social welfare organisations with a view to benefiting more elderly residents. The HKHA and the HKHS will also continue looking into the application of more smart solutions in their rental estates, such as exploring the use of robots to assist in carrying heavy items to strengthen support for elderly residents.

(2) to (4)The HKHA provides eligible elderly households who do not receive Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) with subsidies to install Emergency Alarm Systems (EAS) (also known as ""Safety Bell""), so that the elderly in need are able to seek prompt assistance in case of emergency. The HKHA has extended the scope of the EAS subsidy to cover not only traditional EAS but also mobile EAS, such as mobile phones and watches equipped with EAS as well as products with fall detection function. Elderly households may purchase the said devices on their own. Successful applicants will be given a one-off subsidy of not more than $2,500 to cover the actual expenses. As at end November 2025, the HKHA had approved over 26 000 applications. The HKHA does not keep the breakdown of the age profile or the districts of the applicants.

On the other hand, for elderly CSSA recipients aged 65 or above, if they are single or living in a family with other family members who cannot take care of him/her, may apply for a special grant from the SWD to cover the fees for installing and using indoor or mobile EAS. CSSA recipients aged 60 to 64 may also apply for the same special grant from the SWD if they are single or living in a family with other family members who cannot take care of him/her and certified to be more than 50 per cent disabled or suffering from such medical conditions which, in the opinion of a doctor of a public hospital or clinic, may develop into life threatening conditions and require immediate attention.

From 2020-21 to 2024-25, the number of CSSA recipients receiving the grant for EAS dropped from 32 745 to 25 543, alongside the decrease in the number of CSSA elderly cases from 128 863 to 110 846. The CSSA recipients decide on whether to apply for the grant for EAS based on their individual circumstances with varying reasons. Staff at Social Security Field Units of SWD will provide eligible CSSA recipients with information on the relevant grant and facilitate their applications. Apart from the grant provided under CSSA, various organisations in society also offer CSSA recipients similar EAS assistance.

The SWD has not designated any service providers with regards the grant for EAS provided under the CSSA Scheme. CSSA recipients in need are free to purchase suitable EAS according to their needs. Separately, under the District Services and Community Care Teams - Pilot Scheme on Supporting Elderly and Carers, the Government subsidises eligible elderly persons and persons with disabilities referred by the Care Teams to install and use the emergency alarm services. Such services are provided by the designated service providers engaged by the SWD through established procurement procedures. The SWD monitors the provision of the services in accordance with the service contracts, as well as reviews and enhances the services as appropriate.

(5) to (7)The HKHA always upholds the values of ""caring"" and keeps pace with the times to actively explore measures that facilitate elderly persons and address various needs of elderly residents through the application of innovative technologies. In April 2025, the HKHA launched the Pilot Scheme of the IoT Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households in Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong and Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin. The elderly households who voluntarily participated in the Scheme were equipped with the system which allows designated relatives or friends to keep track of the movement of the elderly concerned in and out of their flats and to provide timely support when needed. The HKHA may also conduct regular statistical analysis through its back-end systems. The Scheme concerned is still being run on a trial basis, with voluntary participation by a total of 55 elderly singleton households. As at end December 2025, four alerts were issued regarding prolonged periods of door inactivity. The said alerts did not involve any accidents, and were triggered by households' extended trips or hospitalisation without deactivating the sensors.

Subject to residents' participation and the availability of resources, the HD will identify suitable estates for expansion of the Pilot Scheme along with simultaneous receipt of door-opening/closing notifications. The HD will actively explore the feasibility of implementing other similar schemes in collaboration with other government departments and social welfare organisations, with a view to benefiting more elderly households in other PRH estates.

In the past 5 years (i.e. from 2021 to November 2025), the number of natural death cases recorded in PRH units under the HD is set out in the table below. HD does not maintain statistical breakdowns by age, district, or whether the concerned individuals had EAS installed.

立法會十七題：大型文化及體育設施的供應,2026-01-21 12:30,2026-01-21 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100249.htm,"​以下是今日（一月二十一日）在立法會會議上霍啟剛議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，確保大型文化及體育（文體）設施的穩定供應是支持文化產業化發展的重要基礎。據報香港於二○二四年舉辦了超過210項盛事，而二○二四年至二○二五年上半年有超過285場大型演唱會在港舉行，粗略估算有超過390萬名觀眾，當中有超過140‍萬名旅客，為本港帶來約34億元的消費額及約19億元的經濟增加值。然而，現有大型文體設施的使用率恆常超過90%，反映該等設施的供應不足，有業界人士認為有關情況限制了舉辦大型活動的靈活性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於根據《北部都會區行動綱領》，北部都會區（北都）的土地為在港建立世界級的文化設施和多元文化空間提供了新的機遇，而標誌性文化設施綜合項目和不同表演藝術專屬場地也會在新田科技城和北都建設，政府就該等文化及表演設施項目的具體計劃為何，包括已確認的大型文體設施選址、面積規模，以及預計落成年份及目前進度等；

（二）政府有否考慮優化「活化工廈計劃」，以為文藝創意業界提供進一步支持，包括推出便利措施支持在工業大廈舉行小型文化表演；

（三）鑑於香港首次參與承辦的第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會已完滿閉幕，政府有何計劃總結本港大型文體設施於該盛事中舉辦體育賽事的寶貴經驗和得益，以長遠推動本港與粵港澳大灣區其他內地城市的深度融合發展，為日後申辦國際文體盛事奠定基礎；

（四）《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》公布的24項完善文藝創意產業生態圈的措施至今的實施進度為何；有否評估該等措施對增加本港大型文體設施供應的具體貢獻為何；及

（五）鑑於《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出建設本港為國際體育盛事之都，為提升香港作為國際體育城市的產業競爭力，當局會否全面檢討大型文體設施的運作機制，包括選出重點設施進行市場化改革，以優化資源分配及應付增長的體育需求，從而全面支持本港文體產業化發展？

答覆：

主席：

就霍啟剛議員的提問，經諮詢發展局後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（四）文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）、康樂及文化事務署（康文署）及夥伴機構正積極推展《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》（《藍圖》）四個發展方向下的71項措施，包括發展方向4：完善文藝創意產業生態圈的24項措施。目前，《藍圖》各項措施實施進度良好，不少項目亦已取得標誌性的進展。

在增加大型文化設施供應方面，我們已逐步落實經改革的政府表演場地預訂政策，透過重塑表演場地定位為藝文界提供更切合時宜的使用空間。具體措施包括香港體育館（紅館）改為演唱會優先；東九文化中心作長期演出及藝術科技的重點場地；沙田大會堂演奏廳設為粵劇優先場地；以及優化康文署的「場地伙伴計劃」。我們期望為不同演藝團體和演唱會主辦單位提供更多檔期，並配合發展盛事（包括演唱會）經濟、推動文旅融合等新政策目標。

另外，我們亦投放資源興建和優化文化設施。其中，正在興建並預計於二○二六年落成的西九演藝中心，其大劇院、中劇場和小劇場將分別提供1 450個、600個和270個座位。康文署亦正有序推進多項在北部都會區建設文化設施的計劃，興建中的項目包括天水圍香港文保中心（前稱文物修復資源中心）和粉嶺新界東文化中心。天水圍香港文保中心預計於二○二八年啟用，將提升康文署在蒐集、保存、研究和展示文物方面的功能，亦作為培育青年人和推動文化交流的平台，為本地文物修復的發展注入新動力。粉嶺新界東文化中心則預計於二○三○年啟用，作為一所多功能專業表演場地，有利成為香港與大灣區藝團的合作共創項目的平台。

此外，我們正積極與國家相關博物館對接，為推進在古洞北設立介紹國家發展和成就的博物館做好前期籌劃。

長遠而言，政府正研究在新田科技城興建一個大型文化設施綜合項目，涵蓋主要博物館、表演場館、圖書館，匯聚本地及國際級豐富多元的展覽及表演節目，進一步鞏固香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的地位。

同時，為配合北部都會區的發展，政府已預留土地發展多項體育及康樂設施，包括體育館、游泳池，以及提供劍擊訓練和比賽的設施等，以滿足市民的康體需要、舉辦體育賽事及為本地運動員提供練習場地。以上設施可充份利用位處北部都會區策略位置，加強與大灣區的協作與交流，有助推動香港體育發展。

政府會持續審視規劃中的工程項目的緩急優次，並適時更新工程時間表，以更有效運用公共資源。

（二）政府透過研究放寬不同場地的限制，提供更多表演和展覽場地，例如容許戲院用作現場表演。根據現行法例，戲院若用作現場表演，院商須預先向食物環境衞生署（食環署）申請及獲其批出一次過特別准許，視乎是否需要搭設臨時建築物，需時至少18或42個工作天。為進一步簡化有關申請程序，文創產業發展處於二○二五年七月協調有關部門（包括食環署、消防處及屋宇署）與香港戲院商會會面商議簡化程序。食環署現正積極推進與各部門擬定申請表以便利院商提交申請。

至於工業大廈（工廈）方面，政府在二○一八年重啟的「活化工廈計劃」，主要有重建和整幢改裝兩方面。如重建一九八七年前落成的工廈，而研究後證明技術可行並獲城市規劃委員會批准，重建地積比可增加最多兩成。至於整幢改裝樓齡15年或以上和位處「商業」或「工業」等地帶的工廈，可免收地契豁免書費用，如該工廈建於一九八七年或以後，須撥出改裝後樓面的一成以供作政府認可用途包括文化藝術或創意產業。針對業權分散未有計劃重建或改裝的工廈，現有政策容許工廈個別單位業主在無須向地政總署申請短期地契豁免書和繳付任何費用的情況下，可把單位用作藝術工作室（例如作藝術表演的排練場地）等五項用途（註一），但考慮到有關工廈其他單位仍可用作工業用途，基於公眾安全考慮，不可包括直接提供服務或貨品等會吸引公眾到訪的用途或活動（包括公開表演）。發展局正與規劃署和地政總署進行新一輪工廈研究，今年內提出建議，包括「活化工廈計劃」未來路向。

政府會繼續研究放寬不同場地的限制，以開拓更多場地空間。

（三）香港首次連同廣東和澳門共同承辦第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會），充分利用啟德體育園及其他現有體育設施，同時展現粵港澳三地城市發揮大灣區的優勢，以及香港具備舉辦大型體育盛事的條件和能力。十五運會和殘特奧會的辦賽經驗不但進一步提升香港舉辦大型盛事的能力，更可深化粵港澳三地的體育合作和大灣區的融合發展。

在十五運會期間，香港特區政府與國家體育總局、廣東省人民政府、澳門特區政府簽署《關於加強體育合作、促進融合發展的協議》（《四方協議》），加強粵港澳大灣區的體育交流和融合發展，當中包括在體育資源整合、賽事聯合舉辦等方面進一步深度合作。在《四方協議》的戰略框架下，三地各政府部門及體育總會的交流將會更頻繁，為將來香港與大灣區進一步合作舉辦大型盛事奠定堅實的基礎。

（五）特區政府一直重視體育發展，並致力於優化相關設施的運作機制，以確保資源能有效分配、滿足體育需求以及促進體育產業的增長。

隨着啟德體育園的啟用以及十五運會和殘特奧會的成功舉辦，香港在大型體育設施規劃和籌辦國際級賽事方面的經驗得以進一步加強。政府將善用啟德體育園等基建，吸引更多國際體育盛事落戶香港，強化「體育+盛事」經濟效益，鞏固香港作為國際體育盛事之都的地位，並貢獻體育產業化的發展。

此外，《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出在康文署指定設施引入市場營運模式，提供更多元的增值活動；並會探討邀請市場參與，提升鯉魚門公園度假營的營運及在指定試點營運沙灘，以建設康樂休閒及水上活動熱點。康文署已選取八個轄下的康文設施，包括香港藝術館、香港文化中心、遮打花園、啟德車站廣場等，引入商業元素及靈活地提供更多元的增值活動，提升吸引力，支持本港文體產業化的發展。

註一：其餘用途為辦公室（設計及媒體製作）、辦公室（影音錄製室）、辦公室（只限於「特定創意產業」，包括設計及媒體製作公司、印刷及出版業、電影公司和與電影業有關的行業組織）、以及研究所、設計及發展中心。"
Speech by DSJ at conference on The Future of Hong Kong Economy (English only) (with photo),2026-01-21 12:30,2026-01-21 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100281.htm,"Following is the keynote speech by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Thought Leadership Conference Series: The Future of Hong Kong Economy organised by the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Business School today (January 21):

Professor Wong (the Provost and Deputy Vice-Chancellor of HKU and Director of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy, Professor Richard Wong), Professor Cai (the Dean and Chair of Economics of the HKU Business School, Professor Cai Hongbin), Professor Mokyr (the recipient of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, Professor Joel Mokyr), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. I am most pleased to address such a distinguished audience today at the conference on The Future of Hong Kong Economy 2026.

The year 2026 unfolds against a global backdrop of complexity and uncertainty. Issues like geopolitical tensions, supply chain shifts and tariff disputes are reshaping the flow of capital and the operation of businesses. Yet history shows that Hong Kong's prosperity has always been fuelled by embracing changes, and by turning challenges into opportunities.

This leads me to the theme today - how Hong Kong can continue to serve as a trusted platform for business growth in the region and beyond. Please allow me to structure my remarks around three ""C""s: Certainty, Capability, and Connectivity.

Certainty - rule of law as economic bedrock

The first and most fundamental ""C"" is Certainty.

For businesses to thrive and economies to flourish, we need above all a predictable environment: certainty in contracts, in dispute resolution and in the enforcement of rights and obligations. In short, certainty is underpinned by the rule of law.

Hong Kong's success as an international financial, trading, and legal services centre is inseparable from its solid rule-of-law foundation. Our common law system, constitutionally guaranteed under the Basic Law, has been operating with integrity for over 180 years here. Judicial independence, equality before the law, and respect for contractual freedom are core values that we all treasure.

In an era when businesses must navigate multiple jurisdictions and political risks, Hong Kong offers something unique: a stable, bilingual, and internationally trusted legal environment. As the only common law jurisdiction within China, and the only one operating fully in both Chinese and English, Hong Kong provides unparalleled credibility and convenience for cross-border transactions.

Under the Basic Law, free flow of capital is guaranteed. Investments and properties in Hong Kong are protected by a robust regulatory regime administered by bodies including the Securities and Futures Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

The jurisprudence of the Hong Kong courts commands high respect in other common law jurisdictions. In a recent judgement, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council sitting in London referred to and discussed no fewer than six Hong Kong decisions from the past few years when determining insolvency issues raised in an appeal before it. This credibility is reflected in our consistent global standing - Hong Kong ranks among the top jurisdictions globally for business legislation and dispute resolution, making us the world's second-most preferred seat for arbitration and number one in the Asia-Pacific region.

Legal certainty is also a strategic enabler that allows businesses to plan long term, deploy capital with confidence, and innovate without fear. This foundation makes Hong Kong the ideal international legal hub for proactive collaboration in an era where ""safe passage"" for capital is more critical than ever.

Capability - professional services powering economic growth

Building on certainty comes the second ""C"": Capability.

Hong Kong's professional services ecosystem - spanning across legal, finance, accounting, tax, risk management, and dispute resolution - is one of our most powerful strengths. Their quality services are integral to value creation - by empowering businesses to manage risks effectively, tackling compliance issues skilfully, structuring transactions securely, and resolving disputes efficiently.

Our legal profession is international in outlook and local in insight. Our financial and accounting professionals operate to global standards while understanding regional realities. Together, they provide end-to-end support across the entire business lifecycle - from market entry and project financing, to management of an intellectual property rights portfolio, regulatory compliance, restructuring, and cross-border dispute resolution.

In a world of tariff disputes, sanctions, and regulatory divergence, companies increasingly rely on professional services to navigate complexity. Whether expanding into ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), the Middle East, Africa, or other markets, businesses require bespoke solutions - solutions that are legally sound, commercially viable, and culturally informed.

This is precisely where Hong Kong excels. We are home to a deep pool of professionals, recently ranked first in Asia and fourth globally under the IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Talent Ranking.

Our professionals speak the universal language of business, with clear understanding of the nuances of different legal systems, market practices, and risk profiles. We have over 13 000 local lawyers and over 1 500 foreign lawyers from over 30 jurisdictions, including some 500 from the Chinese Mainland as well as more than 80 foreign law firms. Furthermore, we have a unique asset - over 600 lawyers with dual qualifications to practice in both Hong Kong and the Mainland cities of the Greater Bay Area.

In my view, an enterprise expanding globally is like a gentleman visiting a tailor shop for an impeccable suit. An off-the-rack solution simply does not work. What businesses need, and Hong Kong can offer, is a bespoke experience - professional services that cater to the client's needs and execute with precision to ensure a perfect fit for every occasion.

Connectivity - GoGlobal and Hong Kong's strategic role

This brings me to the third ""C"": Connectivity.

Hong Kong has long been described as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"". It highlights Hong Kong's crucial role under the ""one country, two systems"" in connecting the Chinese Mainland with the rest of the world.

In recent years, the Government has taken proactive steps to strengthen this role by supporting enterprises, particularly Mainland enterprises, to use Hong Kong as a launch pad for global expansion.

Under the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, I have been tasked to promote our legal services and co-ordinate with other professional sectors to meet the going global needs of Mainland enterprises.

To this end, we launched the Hong Kong Professional Services GoGlobal Platform last December. It serves two major functions:

(1) Information integration: We make information on professional services providers and their capability easily accessible to enterprises. At the launch ceremony of the Platform, we published a collection of over 50 success stories covering a wide range of sectors and extensive markets including Asia, Middle East and Africa.

(2) Needs matching: We enhance co-ordination to meet the specific needs of enterprises. For instance, I recently led a cross-professional delegation to Shenzhen for a direct exchange between our experts and Mainland enterprises. This initiative was well-received.

Earlier this month, we also established the Expert Committee on Professional Services for Going Global, comprising experts from relevant fields, to advise me on our strategy to promote Hong Kong as the premier two-way platform for attracting investment and going global.

Looking ahead

Ladies and gentlemen, as we consider Hong Kong's economic outlook in 2026, we should neither be complacent nor pessimistic. The challenges are real. But so are our strengths.

The certainty under our rule of law infrastructure instils trust. The capability of our professional services delivers solutions. The connectivity through our GoGlobal initiatives provides opportunities.

The relationship between law and the economy is practical, dynamic, and deeply intertwined. A resilient economy requires a credible legal system. A modern legal system must serve real economic needs. In Hong Kong, these two have grown together - and they will continue to do so.

With continued collaboration among the Government, businesses, and the professional community, I am sure that Hong Kong will not only navigate the present uncertainties, but emerge stronger, more relevant, and more connected to the world.

On that note, I wish you all a fruitful conference today and continued success in your endeavours. Thank you very much.  "
LCQ17: Supply of major cultural and sports facilities,2026-01-21 12:30,2026-01-21 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/21/P2026012100250.htm,"​Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Fok and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (January 21):

Question:

There are views that ensuring a stable supply of major cultural and sports (C&S) facilities is an important foundation for supporting the industrialisation of the cultural sector. It is reported that Hong Kong hosted over 210 mega events in 2024, and that more than 285 large-scale pop concert performances were held in the city between 2024 and the first half of 2025. Rough estimates suggest that these concerts attracted over 3.9 ‍million spectators, including more than 1.4 million tourists, generating approximately $3.4 billion in local spending and contributing around $1.9 ‍billion in value added to the local economy. However, utilisation rates at existing major C&S facilities have consistently exceeded 90 per cent, reflecting an insufficient supply of such facilities. Some members of the sectors consider that this situation has constrained the flexibility with which major events can be staged. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that, according to the Northern Metropolis Action Agenda, the land resources in the Northern Metropolis (NM) offer new opportunities to develop world-class cultural facilities and a pluralistic cultural environment in Hong Kong, and that an iconic cultural complex and various dedicated performing venues will also be built in the San Tin Technopole and the NM, of the Government's specific plans for such cultural and performance facility projects, including the confirmed sites for major C&S facilities, their respective sizes and scales, the anticipated years of completion and the current progress of such projects;

(2) whether the Government has considered enhancing the Revitalisation Scheme for Industrial Buildings to provide further support for the arts, cultural and creative sectors, including introducing facilitation measures to support the staging of small-scale cultural performances in industrial buildings;

(3) given the successful conclusion of the 15th National Games, the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games, in which Hong Kong participated for the first time as a co-host, what plans the Government has in place to consolidate the valuable experience and benefits gained from hosting sports events at Hong Kong's major C&S facilities during the Games, with a view to promoting in-depth integration and development between Hong Kong and other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area over the long term, and laying the groundwork for future bids to host major international C&S events;

(4) of the progress made to date in implementing the 24 measures announced in the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development to enhance the ecosystem for arts, culture and creative industries; whether it has assessed the specific contribution of these measures to increasing the supply of major C&S facilities in Hong Kong; and

(5) given the proposal in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" to build Hong Kong into a centre for mega international sports events, whether the authorities will, with a view to enhancing Hong Kong's industrial competitiveness as an international sports city, conduct a comprehensive review of the operating mechanisms of major C&S facilities, including identifying key facilities for market-oriented reform, so as to optimise resource allocation and meet the growing demand for sports, thereby providing full support for the industrialisation of Hong Kong's C&S sectors?

Reply：

President：

In consultation with the Development Bureau, the reply to the question raised by the Hon Kenneth Fok is as follows:

(1) and (4) The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and partner organisations have been actively taking forward the 71 measures under the four strategic directions of the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development (Blueprint), including the 24 measures under Strategic Direction 4 ""Enhance the Ecosystem for the Arts, Culture and Creative Industries"". At present, the implementation of various Blueprint measures is of good progress and significant development has been achieved for many of them.

On increasing the supply of large-scale culture facilities, we have implemented the reformed hiring policy for public performance venues progressively, providing spaces that better cater for arts and cultural activities of the time through repositioning the performance venues. Specific measures include refocusing the Hong Kong Coliseum to prioritise concerts; positioning the East Kowloon Cultural Centre as a signature venue for long-running performances and arts technology; according priority for Cantonese opera at the Sha Tin Town Hall Auditorium; and enhancing the LCSD's Venue Partnership Scheme. We hope to provide more slots for different arts groups and concert organisers, and align with the new policy objectives as developing mega events (including concerts) economy and promoting the integration of culture and tourism.

In addition, we have also dedicated resources in developing and enhancing culture facilities. Currently under construction and scheduled to be completed in 2026, the WestK Performing Arts Centre (WestK PAC) will provide a 1 450-seat Grand Theatre, a 600-seat Medium Theatre and a 270-seat Studio Theatre. The LCSD is also implementing multiple projects on the development of culture facilities in the Northern Metropolis in an orderly manner. Projects under construction include the Hong Kong Conservation Repository (formerly the Heritage Conservation and Resource Centre) in Tin Shui Wai and the New Territories East Cultural Centre in Fanling. The Hong Kong Conservation Repository in Tin Shui Wai is expected to come into operation in 2028. The Repository will enhance the institutional capacity and elevate the position of the LCSD in the acquisition, preservation, research, and display of artefacts, as well as serving as a platform to nurture young people and encourage cultural exchanges, thereby injecting new impetus into the development of conservation profession in Hong Kong. The New Territories East Cultural Centre in Fanling is expected to open in 2030. It will serve as a multi-purpose professional performance venue, providing an interactive platform facilitating collaborations among arts groups from Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

Besides, we are working proactively with relevant museums in the Chinese Mainland on the preparatory works for establishing the museum showcasing the development and achievements of our country in Kwu Tung North.

In the long run, the Government is exploring the establishment of a large-scale cultural complex in San Tin Technopole, which includes a major museum, a performance venue and a library, bringing together a diverse and world-class array of local and international exhibitions and performances, further consolidating Hong Kong's position as the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

In the meantime, to support the development of the Northern Metropolis, the Government has reserved sites for developing various sports and recreation facilities, including sports centres, swimming pools, and facilities for fencing training and competition. These facilities will meet the sports and recreation needs of the community, support the staging of sports events, and provide training venues for local athletes. Making best use of their strategic locations in the Northern Metropolis, they can strengthen the collaboration and exchange with the GBA, thereby contributing to the sports development in Hong Kong.

The Government will continue to review the order of priority of works projects under planning and update their works schedules as appropriate so as to make more effective use of public resources.

(2) The Government has been exploring ways to relax restrictions of different venues to open up more spaces for performances and exhibitions, such as allowing cinemas to be used for live performances. According to the prevailing laws, if a cinema is to be used for live performances, its operator must apply for and obtain from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) a one-off special permission prior to the live performances. Depending on whether temporary structures need to be erected, the approval process takes at least 18 or 42 working days. To further streamlining the application procedures, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency had convened a meeting in July 2025 rounding up the relevant Government departments (including the FEHD, the Fire Services Department and the Buildings Department) and the Hong Kong Theatres Association to identify room for streamlining. The FEHD has been actively working with the relevant departments to draw up a standard application form to facilitate the submission of application by operators.

In respect of the industrial buildings (IBs), the Revitalisation Scheme for IBs reactivated by the Government in 2018 comprises two aspects of redevelopment and wholesale conversation. For redevelopment of IBs constructed before 1987, subject to technical feasibility study and approval by the Town Planning Board, the plot ratio after redevelopment may be increased by up to 20 per cent. As regards to wholesale conversation of IBs aged 15 years or above in ""Commercial"" or ""Industrial"" zones, waiver fees may be exempted, and if the IB was constructed in or after 1987, 10 per cent of the converted floor space must be used for purposes designated by the Government including arts and cultural or creative industries.In respect of IBs with fragmented ownership and no redevelopment or conversation plans, the prevailing policy allows owner of individual IB units to use the units, without having to apply for a short-term waiver from the Lands Department(LandsD) and pay waiver fees, for five specified uses (Note 1), which include ""Art Studio"" (e.g. rehearsal space for art performances). However, considering that the other units in the concerned IB may still be used for industrial purposes and in view of public safety, the uses do not include any uses or activities that directly provide services or goods to attract public visits (including public performance). The Development Bureau is conducting a new round of study on industrial stock with the Planning Department and the LandsD, and will put forward recommendations this year, including the way forward for the Revitalisation Scheme for IBs.

The Government will continue to explore ways to relax restrictions of different venues to open up more venue spaces.

(3) Hong Kong co-hosted the 15th National Games (NG), and the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NGDSO) with Guangdong and Macao for the first time, making full use of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) and other existing sports facilities, and showcasing how cities in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao leverage their advantages in the GBA. It also demonstrated the capabilities of Hong Kong in hosting major sports events. The experience from co-hosting the NG and the NGDSO not only enhanced Hong Kong's ability to organise mega events, but also deepened sports exchanges among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and promoted the integrated development of GBA.

During the NG, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government, the Macao SAR Government and the People's Government of Guangdong Province signed the agreement with the General Administration of Sport of China on the strengthening of sports co-operation and promotion of integrated development (the Four-Party Agreement). The Four-Party Agreement aims to bolster sports exchanges and the integrated development of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao GBA, including further collaboration in areas such as consolidation of sports resources and joint hosting of sports competitions. Under the strategic framework of the Four-Party Agreement, there will be more frequent exchanges between government departments and sports associations of the three places, laying a solid foundation for future co-operation between Hong Kong and GBA to co-host major events.

(5) The Government has all along attached great importance to sports development and is committed to optimising the operation mechanism of relevant facilities to ensure effective resource allocation, meet the demand for sports and promote the development of the sports industry.

With the commissioning of KTSP and the successful conclusion of the NG and the NGDSO, Hong Kong's experience in planning large-scale sports infrastructure and organising international-level competitions has been enhanced. The Government will make best use of KTSP and other sports infrastructures to attract more major international sports events to be held in Hong Kong, driving economic benefits from ""sports + mega events"" development, reinforcing Hong Kong's status as the centre for major international sports events and contributing to the development of sports as an industry.

Moreover, ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that market-based business models will be introduced into designated facilities of the LCSD to provide more diverse value-added activities. Feasibility of engaging the market to enhance the operations of the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp and selected beaches will also be explored to promote the development of recreational, leisure and aquatic hotspots. The LCSD has designated eight leisure and cultural facilities under their management, including the Hong Kong Museum of Art, the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, the Chater Garden, the Kai Tak Station Square, for introducing commercial elements and flexibly providing more diverse value-added activities to enhance their attractiveness in support of the development of Hong Kong's cultural and sports industries.
