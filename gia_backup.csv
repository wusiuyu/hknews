The events were well attended by representatives from local governments, as well as the business, academic and cultural sectors.

  On February 10, the London ETO and the Denmark-Hong Kong Trade Association cohosted an evening reception in Copenhagen, welcoming over 130 guests. In her welcoming remarks, the Director-General of the London ETO, Miss Fiona Chau, said that Hong Kong and Denmark are natural partners in green and sustainable finance. Denmark's strengths in renewable energy and climate innovation complement Hong Kong's position as Asia's international financial centre, creating broad opportunities for deeper co-operation between the two places.

  Miss Chau highlighted that Hong Kong's deep capital markets, robust institutional framework and expanding green finance tools enable innovative projects to scale up and achieve commercialisation across the region. These advantages create opportunities to bring Danish technologies to markets and foster long-term partnerships throughout Asia.

  On February 11, the London ETO and the Finland-Hong Kong Business Association cohosted an afternoon reception in Helsinki, greeting over 140 guests. Speaking at the reception, Miss Chau highlighted the strong and growing partnership between Hong Kong and Finland, underpinned by increasing collaboration in life sciences, biotechnology and medtech. She said that Hong Kong provides a strong platform that integrates research, funding and commercialisation.

  Miss Chau also highlighted the continued confidence of Finnish enterprises in Hong Kong's market and the practical support provided by Hong Kong's professional services ecosystem in areas such as market entry, trade promotion, financing and regional partnerships. Beyond business, she noted the strong cultural and people-to-people connections between the two places, noting that collaboration in the arts and creative sectors further enriches bilateral ties.

  Both receptions featured interactive sharing sessions from business associations, thematic discussions with industry representatives and experience sharing by enterprises, providing guests with practical insights into collaboration opportunities between Hong Kong and the two markets.

  The London ETO will continue to organise activities to celebrate the Year of the Horse and to strengthen economic and trade ties with countries under its purview, while promoting Hong Kong's unique advantages."

"FEHD continues to actively follow up on food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters and instructs trade to suspend importing and selling of raw oysters produced by Mariscos Escacha, S.L. (processing plant) from Spain",2026-02-13 23:22,2026-02-13 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300954.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (February 13) instructed the trade to suspend the import and sale of raw oysters produced by Mariscos Escacha, S.L. (12.04628/PO) (processing plant) from Spain. The trade should stop using or selling the affected product immediately should they possess it.

The aforesaid instruction by the CFS was based on the follow-up investigation of recently reported food poisoning cases related to the consumption of raw oysters, which revealed involvement of the consumption of raw oysters produced by Mariscos Escacha, S.L. (12.04628/PO) (processing plant) from Spain. For the sake of prudence, the CFS has immediately instructed the trade to suspend the import into and sale within Hong Kong of raw oysters produced by Mariscos Escacha, S.L. (12.04628/PO) processing plant) from Spain to safeguard food safety.

The CFS has informed the Spanish authorities of the matter and will notify the local trade. It will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action.

From February 1 to 12 this year, the CFS received 37 food poisoning cases related to the consumption of raw oysters. Officers from the CFS and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the FEHD immediately conducted investigations at the restaurants involved in the cases, reviewing their food handling procedures and tracing the sources of the oysters.

The CFS's investigations revealed that 13 cases involved the consumption of raw oysters supplied by Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd. of Korea. For the sake of prudence, the CFS instructed the trade on February 5 to stop the import and sale in Hong Kong of raw oysters supplied by this company.

In addition, the CFS found that 15 cases involved the consumption of raw oysters supplied by the food factory Jeton International Foods and 88 Investment Holdings Limited. The CFS has immediately instructed the company to suspend the sale and supply of raw oysters, and issued a press release on February 6 on its related follow-up work, requiring the trade to stop selling raw oysters supplied by the company concerned. Other cases involved the consumption of raw oysters from various countries.

In view of the recent surge in food poisoning cases related to the consumption of raw oysters, the FEHD has carried out special operations in various districts from February 6 to 12 and stepped up inspections to over 1 200 food premises selling oysters across Hong Kong, thereby safeguarding food safety and protecting public health. The focuses of the inspections included the storage temperature of raw oysters, storage conditions in designated refrigerators, the sources of supply, the personal hygiene of food handlers, the hygienic condition of the premises, verifying source documents and health certificates, and collecting samples for testing. During the inspections, the FEHD officers also provided immediate advice on food storage, handling and environmental hygiene, to ensure licensees/permittees comply with licensing conditions and statutory hygiene standards. The CFS has also stepped up the collection of raw oyster samples for testing.

The CFS reminded that as oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater and absorbing suspended food particles therein, bacteria (e.g. Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus) and viruses (e.g. norovirus and Hepatitis A virus) may accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Consuming oysters without thorough cooking might risk direct intake of these microorganisms. Susceptible groups, such as pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, should avoid eating them.

Consumers are advised to purchase or consume oysters only from food premises licensed or permitted by the FEHD. The trade and food handlers should understand the importance of adhering to good personal hygiene and proper food handling, and provide regular training on hygiene practices and norovirus-related risks. Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food. Separate utensils and cutting boards should be used for raw and ready-to-eat foods, with regular cleaning and disinfection. Food handlers who exhibit symptoms of infection should refrain from handling food until they have been symptom-free for at least 48 hours."
Parties ordered to pay $0.58 million in fines and demolition costs for unlawful occupation of government land in Tuen Mun Villa Cornwall case,2026-02-13 23:10,2026-02-13 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300945.htm,"​A spokesperson for the Lands Department (LandsD) said today (February 13) that the parties related to a detached house in Tuen Mun named Villa Cornwall (including a company and its sole shareholder) were convicted on February 10 in the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts for unlawfully occupying government land and erecting structures thereon, and failing to comply with the statutory notice to cease occupation of government land, thereby contravening sections 6(4) and 6(4A) of the Land (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, and were fined $245,250 and ordered to pay another $341,500 to the LandsD for the costs of demolition of part of the structures, totalling $586,750. The LandsD will arrange for the demolition of the remaining illegal structures as soon as practicable and recover the demolition costs from the convicted parties.

The convicted parties in this case unlawfully occupied a piece of government land of approximately 1 450 square metres adjoining a detached house in Tuen Mun named Villa Cornwall and erected illegal structures on the land. In November 2023, the LandsD issued a statutory notice under the Land (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance to the parties concerned, requiring them to cease occupying the government land and demolish the illegal structures thereon. As the parties failed to comply with the statutory notice before the required date, the LandsD took possession of and fenced off the government land in February 2024. Upon the completion of its investigation, the LandsD instituted prosecution against the offenders in August of the same year.

The spokesperson said, ""Unauthorised erection of structures on unleased government land and failure to comply with the statutory notice to cease occupation of government land are both criminal offences. Members of the public should not defy the law. The LandsD will continue to take enforcement action against cases of unlawful occupation of government land, including prosecuting offenders.""

Under the Land (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, any person who without reasonable excuse does not cease to occupy government land as required by the statutory notice is liable to prosecution. Upon conviction, the offender is liable to a maximum penalty of a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for six months on the first occasion, and to a maximum further fine of $50,000 for each day during which the offence continues. The offender, if convicted on each subsequent occasion, is liable to a fine of up to $1,000,000 and imprisonment for six months, and to a maximum further fine of $100,000 for each day during which the offence continues. Moreover, any person who is engaged in any way in the erection of a structure on unleased government land, or who arranges or directs the erection of a structure on unleased government land, is also liable to prosecution. The offender, on the first conviction for a gainful purpose, is liable to a maximum penalty of a fine of $2,500,000 and imprisonment for one year; and on each subsequent occasion of conviction, a maximum fine of $5,000,000 and imprisonment for one year. If convicted for other purposes (i.e. other than a gainful purpose), the offender is liable to a maximum penalty of a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for six months on the first occasion, and a maximum fine of $1,000,000 and imprisonment for six months on each subsequent occasion of conviction."
FSD mounts joint operation with Hong Kong Customs and Police against illicit fueling activities and holds special meeting with oil industry to strengthen intelligence collection and combat strategies (with photos),2026-02-13 22:54,2026-02-13 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300870.htm,"The Fire Services Department (FSD), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Customs (Customs) and the Hong Kong Police Force (Police), launched a joint operation codenamed ""Flow Stopper"" today (February 13), specifically targeting on blackspots of illicit fueling activities in urban areas for a focused crackdown with a view to curbing the spread of such activities in densely populated areas and ensuring public safety.

During the operation, the FSD officers deployed unmanned aircraft systems for aerial surveillance and successfully detected seven concealed blackspots. The law enforcement officers smashed two cases in total, including one mobile illegal petrol fueling station on Hoi Fai Road in Tai Kwok Tsui and one illegal diesel fueling station on Wang Kwong Road in Kowloon Bay. About 600 litres of suspected illicit motor spirit and 1 000 litres of diesel were seized, along with a large batch of fueling equipment. The persons suspected to be connected with the cases included two persons who were believed to be the persons-in-charge of the illegal fueling stations and a man who was patronising a station. They were suspected of violating the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation, the Dangerous Goods Ordinance (DGO) and the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO). Besides, two vehicles suspected of being used as illicit fueling stations and one vehicle patronising for fueling were also seized. Investigation is underway.

In addition, to further enhance strategies for combating illicit fueling activities, the FSD invited government departments such as Customs and the Police, as well as representatives from the oil industry, to a special meeting today to conduct in-depth discussion on intelligence for illicit fueling activities, and the operational tactics for preventing and controlling fuel supply at the source. During the meeting, representatives from the oil industry shared the current models and operational procedures of fuel supply. Focused discussions on enhanced monitoring measures for dangerous goods vehicles collecting fuel at oil depots were also held. These measures include requiring those collecting fuel to provide details and destinations of fuel usage, as well as exploring the possibility of submitting inventory and sales records to relevant enforcement departments for supporting more precise enforcement.

The FSD has all along been committed to combating various kinds of illicit fueling activities. The department urges members of the public not to patronise illegal fueling stations. As these stations lack the proper fire service installations and equipment dedicated for fueling stations, the consequences could be catastrophic in the event of a fire.

Under the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation, it is an offence to possess or control any controlled substance for the business purpose of transferring it into vehicle fuel tanks. The DGO also provides that no person shall manufacture, store, convey or use any dangerous goods unless they possess a licence or exemption granted. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty for the first offence is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for six months.

According to the DCO, any vehicle found conveying illicit motor spirit, as well as any tools, equipment, or articles used or intended to be used in connection with the commission of related offences, shall be liable to forfeiture whether or not any person is convicted of any offence. Anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit motor spirit commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

The law enforcement departments will continue to spare no efforts in combating illicit fueling activities by strengthening interdepartmental collaboration and enhancing technology-based enforcement (such as drone patrols). Members of the public who encounter suspected illegal fueling activities may call the FSD's 24-hour hotline at 5577 9666, or report via the Illicit Fuelling Activities on the Fire Hazard Electronic Complaint Portal of the FSD (fhcp.hkfsd.gov.hk)."
消防處聯同香港海關及警方打擊非法燃油轉注活動 並與石油業召開特別會議加強情報收集及防控策略（附圖）,2026-02-13 22:54,2026-02-13 23:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300869.htm,"消防處聯同香港海關及警務處今日（二月十三日）進行代號「截流」的聯合行動，特別針對市區內的非法燃油轉注黑點作重點打擊，以遏止有關活動在人口稠密地區蔓延，保障公眾安全。

行動中，消防處人員利用無人機進行高空偵察，成功鎖定七個隱蔽黑點。執法人員共偵破兩宗案件，在大角咀海輝道及九龍灣宏光道分別搗破一個流動非法汽油加油站及一個非法柴油加油站，檢獲約600公升未完稅汽油、1 000公升柴油及大批入油工具。涉案人士包括兩名相信為非法加油站負責人及一名正在該處光顧的男子，他們涉嫌觸犯《消防（消除火警危險）規例》、《危險品條例》及《應課稅品條例》。兩輛涉嫌用作非法加油站的車輛及一輛光顧入油的車輛亦被檢取。案件仍在調查中。

​此外，為進一步強化應對非法燃油轉注活動策略，消防處今日邀請海關及警方等政府部門，以及石油相關行業代表舉行特別會議，深入探討非法燃油轉注活動的情報及在源頭堵截燃油供應的防控策略。會議中，石油業界代表分享了現行的燃油供應模式及營運操作，並聚焦討論危險品車輛在油庫取油的各項加強監控措施，包括要求取油者提供燃油使用的詳情及去向，以及探討向執法部門提供庫存及銷售紀錄的可能性，以協助進行精準打擊。

消防處一向致力打擊各類非法燃油轉注活動。處方呼籲市民切勿光顧非法加油站，由於這些加油站未有裝設加油站專用的消防裝置及設備，一旦發生火警，後果堪虞。

根據《消防（消除火警危險）規例》，任何人為業務目的而管有或控制受管制物質，以轉注入汽車油缸，即屬犯罪。《危險品條例》亦規定即，除非領有牌照或獲豁免，否則任何人製造、貯存、運送或使用超過豁免量的危險品，即屬犯罪。一經定罪，首次定罪最高可被判罰款10萬元及監禁六個月。

根據《應課稅品條例》，被發現載有未完稅汽油的車輛，以及任何用作或擬用作干犯相關罪行的工具、用具等物品，不論是否有任何人就任何罪行被定罪，均依法處理及沒收。任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買未完稅汽油即屬違法。一經定罪，最高可被判罰款100萬元及監禁兩年。

各執法部門將繼續透過跨部門協作及科技執法（如無人機巡邏），全力打擊非法燃油轉注活動。市民如發現懷疑非法加油活動，可致電消防處24小時熱線5577 9666，或透過消防處「火警危險電子投訴平台」（fhcp.hkfsd.gov.hk）上的「『油擊』舉報眼」作出舉報。"
"食環署繼續積極跟進進食生蠔食物中毒個案並指示業界暫停進口及在港出售西班牙Mariscos Escacha, S.L.（生產廠房）出產的生蠔",2026-02-13 22:42,2026-02-13 23:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300926.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）食物安全中心（食安中心）今日（二月十三日）指示業界暫停進口及出售西班牙Mariscos Escacha, S.L. (12.04628/PO)（生產廠房）出產的生蠔。業界如持有受影響產品，應立即停止使用或出售。

食安中心作出上述指示，是基於跟進調查最近呈報與生蠔有關的食物中毒個案，發現個案所涉及人士曾進食由西班牙Mariscos Escacha, S.L. (12.04628/PO)（生產廠房）出產的生蠔。為審慎起見，食安中心即時指示業界暫停進口及在港出售所有由西班牙Mariscos Escacha, S.L. (12.04628/PO)（生產廠房）出產的生蠔，以保障食物安全。

食安中心已通知西班牙當局有關事宜，亦會知會本地業界，並繼續跟進事件及採取適當行動。

今年二月一日至十二日，食安中心共接獲37宗由進食生蠔引起的食物中毒個案。食環署食安中心和環境衞生部人員已即時到所有個案的涉事餐廳調查，檢視食物處理流程和追查生蠔來源。

食安中心調查發現，當中13宗個案所涉人士曾進食由韓國Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd.供應的生蠔，為審慎起見，食安中心已於二月五日即時指示業界暫停進口及在港出售由韓國Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd.供應的生蠔。

此外，食安中心發現15宗個案曾進食由供應商傑頓國際食品及88投資控股有限公司（Jeton International Food and 88 Investment Holdings Limited）食物製造工場供應的生蠔。食安中心已即時指示傑頓國際食品及88投資控股有限公司暫停出售和供應生蠔，並在二月六日發出有關跟進工作的新聞稿，指示業界如持有該公司供應的生蠔，應立即停售。其餘個案則涉及進食不同國家的生蠔。

鑑於近期與進食生蠔相關的食物中毒個案有所上升，食環署於二月六日至十二日期間在全港各區採取特別行動，加強巡查全港逾1 200間出售生蠔的食物業處所，以保障食物安全及公眾健康。巡查的重點包括生蠔的保存溫度、存放在指定雪櫃內的情況、生蠔的供應來源、食物處理人員的個人衞生及食物業處所的衞生情況、查核生蠔的來源文件和衞生證明書，以及抽檢生蠔樣本作檢測等。巡查期間，食環署人員亦就食物的存放、處理和衞生情況作出即時衞生建議，確保持牌／持證人或相關負責人遵守有關牌照或許可證條件，並符合法例訂明的衞生標準。食安中心亦已加強抽取生蠔樣本作檢測。

食安中心提醒，由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水、吸收在海水中懸浮食物粒子的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有細菌（例如副溶血性弧菌和創傷弧菌）及病毒（例如諾如病毒和甲型肝炎病毒），這些物質會在蠔的體內積聚。進食未經徹底煮熟的蠔可能會有直接攝入這些微生物的風險，孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者等容易受感染的人士，應避免進食。

消費者應到持有食環署牌照／受限制食物售賣許可證的食物業處所購買或進食生蠔。業界及食物處理人員應了解遵循良好個人衞生習慣和妥善處理食物的重要性，並定期培訓員工有關良好衞生規範及與諾如病毒相關的風險。處理食物前後應用梘液及清水徹底洗手最少20秒，以及使用獨立的器具和砧板處理生食及即食食物，定時清潔和消毒。出現感染症狀的食物處理人員須於症狀消失最少48小時後才再次處理食物。"

入境事務處二○二五年工作回顧（附圖）,2026-02-13 19:50,2026-02-13 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300669.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）處長郭俊峯今日（二月十三日）舉行新聞發布會，回顧入境處過去一年的工作並前瞻未來。入境處二○二五年的主要工作及未來展望摘要如下：

堅守使命維護國家安全

作為維護國家安全體系的重要一環，入境處一直秉持愛國愛港的核心信念，深入踐行「總體國家安全觀」，嚴格按照所有適用法例和現行入境政策，堅定守護國家南大門，全力保障國家主權、安全和發展利益。入境處亦積極配合香港特別行政區（特區）政府的施政部署，力行改革，推動創新，以助香港實現「由治及興」的新飛躍，更好融入國家發展大局，同時鞏固提升香港的國際金融、航運和貿易中心地位，為香港長期繁榮穩定、社會和諧發展貢獻重要力量。

提升效率促進互聯互通

（一）管制站的旅客流量

二○二五年總出入境人次約3.35億，較二○二四年增加約12%，超越了二○一九年3億的水平，創下有紀錄以來的新高。訪港旅客的入境總人次約4989萬，較二○二四年增加約12%。其中，內地訪客入境人次約3783萬，較二○二四年增加約11%，而其他訪客的入境人次則約為1206萬，較二○二四年增加約15%。全年的訪港旅客入境人次中，機場管制站的訪港旅客約有1122萬人次，陸路管制站約為3687萬人次，海路管制站則約為181萬人次。

（二）榮獲Skytrax二○二五年全球最佳機場出入境服務大獎

二○二五年，入境處在國際專業航空運輸研究機構Skytrax的年度旅客意見調查中，第五次贏得全球最佳機場出入境服務大獎。該項調查覆蓋全球接近600個機場，共收集了來自超過100個國家的逾1300萬名航空旅客對各機場出入境服務的評分。入境處會繼續精益求精，運用創新科技，推出更多便利旅客的措施，提供更優質的出入境服務。

（三）便利出入境的措施

（1）擴展e-道服務

為進一步提升管制站的通關效率，入境處持續擴展e-道服務，讓更多香港居民和訪港旅客享受便捷的自助出入境檢查服務。二○二五年，入境處把持有智能身份證的香港永久性居民、持有中國電子普通護照的過境旅客，以及持有電子往來港澳通行證和使用「離境易」的訪港旅客使用e-道服務的合資格年齡，由11歲下調至7歲。截至二○二五年年底，7至10歲兒童使用e-道的人次約為108萬。此外，二○二五年九月，入境處在香港國際機場推出「容易飛e-道」服務，讓合資格的香港居民透過容貌識別技術完成入境檢查手續，過程中無須出示證件或非觸式e-道的加密二維碼。截至二○二五年年底，使用該服務的合資格香港居民人次約26萬。

（2）為第十五屆全國運動會提供出入境便利

入境處全力支持於二○二五年舉行的第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會。為便利各地代表團、運動員及工作人員在全運會期間往返粵港澳三地，入境處在香港國際機場、高鐵西九龍站、港珠澳大橋及深圳灣口岸設置了出入境專屬通道，共提供16條e-道供已登記的運動員及相關人員透過容貌識別技術自助辦理出入境檢查手續。至於跨境賽事方面，入境處聯同全運會統籌辦、相關政府部門，以及內地及澳門的出入境機關，以創新的「前置查驗、閉環管理」模式，成功落實「零延時、零接觸、零等待」的通關安排。在賽事期間，各方保持緊密溝通，讓公路自行車和馬拉松兩項跨境賽事均能無縫順暢地進行。

廣納人才打造人才集聚高地

二十屆三中全會審議通過《中共中央關於進一步全面深化改革、推進中國式現代化的決定》，當中表示支持香港打造國際高端人才集聚高地。行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中亦提出加強香港人才服務辦公室招攬和支援人才的工作，以吸引更多人才來港發展。為配合特區政府積極搶人才、留人才的措施，入境處繼續推行各項經優化的人才入境計劃。入境處於二○二五年一月進一步推動電子化簽證申請服務，讓申請人可透過「入境處流動應用程式」、入境處網頁或香港政府一站通網頁完成整個申請程序，無須親身前往入境處辦事處。有關各項入境計劃／政策所接獲的簽證／進入許可／延期逗留的申請及批准數字詳見附表。

（一）優化人才入境計劃

（1）引入指定技術工種專才及更新人才清單

特區政府於二○二五年六月在一般就業政策及輸入內地人才計劃下增設渠道，容許外來人士申請來港投身「技術專才清單」上八項人力極短缺的技術工種。有關安排為期三年，共設一萬個申請配額，每項技術工種的申請配額以3 000個為限。申請人須符合「技術專才清單」所列明的條件，且年齡介乎18至40歲。首個入境簽證的有效期一般為24或36個月，視乎個別技術工種及申請人的資歷而定。此外，經更新的「人才清單」於二○二五年三月生效，加入了九項專業，涵蓋共60項本地人才短缺的專業，符合相關專業資格的外來人才在透過優秀人才入境計劃、一般就業政策或輸入內地人才計劃申請入境時可獲得便利。

（2）推出科技人才入境計劃的進一步優化措施

特區政府於二○二五年十二月二十四日推出科技人才入境計劃的進一步優化措施，包括精簡申請程序，讓科技公司及合資格人才可同時遞交配額及簽證／進入許可申請；豁免必須從事14個指定科技範疇研發活動的限制；以及為港深創新及科技園增設申請專窗服務。上述措施有助合資格公司加快吸納世界各地的創科人才，便利他們在香港進行與科技相關的研發活動，促進香港的創科發展。

（3）為參與仲裁程序及指定界別短期活動的人士提供入境便利計劃

特區政府於二○二五年三月恆常推行並優化為來港參與仲裁程序的人士提供便利先導計劃，同時把計劃易名為「為來港參與仲裁程序的人士提供入境便利計劃」。經優化的計劃現涵蓋五類合資格人士，以及所有於香港實體舉行的仲裁。此外，由二○二五年十一月起，特區政府進一步擴展「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」，在原有的12個指定界別之上，增設5個新界別，並新增更多認可機構及指定短期活動，讓更多非本地人才可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動而無須申請工作簽證／進入許可。

（二）推出特邀人士入境便利計劃

特區政府於二○二五年三月推出特邀人士入境便利計劃，為來自東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）國家的特邀人士提供更便利的出入境安排，以促進香港與東盟的經貿往來和人文合作。根據計劃，相關政策局／部門會主動邀請能為香港經濟發展帶來相當貢獻，或已獲邀來港出席重要活動的東盟人士，以享出入境便利。入境處會透過電子平台一站式處理特邀人士的相關申請，放寬自助通關的申請資格，以及簡化簽證申請所需提交的資料。

（三）放寬「一帶一路」沿線國家國民來港的簽證安排

為鞏固香港在「一帶一路」框架下的「超級聯繫人」角色，入境處已就多個「一帶一路」沿線國家放寬簽證安排。自二○二五年一月起，沙特阿拉伯國民免簽證來港旅遊的逗留期限，由30天延長至90天。此外，入境處亦自同年九月起放寬中亞四國（即吉爾吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦、土庫曼斯坦和烏茲別克斯坦）國民商務和旅遊多次訪港簽證的申請門檻，以促進香港與中亞經貿和旅遊發展。

以人為本惠民生添幸福

（一）全港市民換領身份證計劃結束及舊款智能身份證失效

隨着全港市民換領身份證計劃於二○二三年三月三日結束，各智能身份證換領中心已停止運作，「到訪院舍換證服務」亦已於二○二五年第一季結束。二○一八年十一月二十六日之前所發出的舊款智能身份證，已於二○二五年分兩階段失效。此外，為應付疫情後換證需求而增設的人事登記處——觀塘（臨時）辦事處，已按計劃於二○二五年十月停止運作。該辦事處關閉後，市民可前往其餘六間人事登記辦事處辦理各項身份證申請。截至二○二五年年底，已有約746萬名身份證持有人換領新智能身份證，換證率約為93%。

（二）簽發特區護照及其持有人可享的免簽證入境待遇

二○二五年，入境處共簽發了超過70萬本特區護照。入境處於二○二五年一月公布，特區護照持有人在抵達沙特阿拉伯的六個指定管制站時，可辦理單次或多次旅遊簽證。同年五月，特區護照持有人可免簽證前往卡塔爾和阿拉伯聯合酋長國旅遊，最長逗留30天；而前往阿曼蘇丹國的免簽證入境期限，亦由10天延長至14天。同年十一月，阿爾及利亞民主人民共和國同意給予特區護照持有人免簽證入境待遇，最長可逗留14天。截至二○二五年年底，合共有174個國家／地區給予特區護照持有人免簽證入境或落地簽證待遇。入境處會繼續游說更多國家／地區給予此項待遇，令特區護照持有人外遊時更加方便。

（三）對在外遇事港人的服務及支援

（1）為身處香港境外遇事的香港居民提供協助

入境處的「協助在外香港居民小組」（小組）一直竭力為身處境外遇事的香港居民提供協助。小組與外交部駐港特派員公署（公署）、中國駐外使領館，以及相關的特區政府部門保持緊密聯繫，為求助人士提供所有切實可行的協助。二○二五年，小組共處理了3 388宗求助個案，其中大部分涉及在境外遺失旅行證件、住院或傷亡等。此外，入境處繼續跟進港人懷疑被誘騙到東南亞國家被禁錮從事非法工作的個案。二○二五年一月至三月期間，入境處人員及保安局專責小組成員先後四次前往泰國，協助涉事港人回港。同年三月，緬甸發生強烈地震，特區政府派出救援隊伍趕赴災區協助搜救工作，當中包括兩名入境處人員；這是特區政府繼二○二三年土耳其地震後，再次參與海外救援行動。同年六月，隨着伊朗與以色列緊張局勢升級，入境處接獲21名身在伊朗、以色列及約旦的香港居民查詢。就此，入境處一直與公署及國家駐當地大使館保持密切聯繫，並按相關人士的意願提供一切可行協助。最終，20名港人安全離開當地，餘下的一名港人則報稱安全並表示無須進一步協助。

（2）領事保護及外遊安全的宣傳工作

二○二五年，入境處與公署繼續攜手舉辦連串活動，廣泛宣傳領事保護及外遊安全資訊，包括於入境處總部及全港各區舉辦巡迴展覽，以及於旅遊展覽擺設攤位等。為加深年青一代對領事保護的認識，增強他們對國家的歸屬感，入境處首次編製領事保護及外遊安全兒童繪本《阿邦的夢想國之旅》，並於二○二五年六月舉行發布會。繪本的實體版已派發至全港逾1500間小學及幼稚園，市民亦可於各區公共圖書館借閱，其電子版則已上載至教育局及入境處網頁，讓學生以深入淺出的方式了解領事保護及外遊安全資訊。

（四）受大埔火災影響的居民補領個人證件及延長逗留期限安排

為全力支援受大埔宏福苑火災影響的居民，入境處於火災發生翌日（二○二五年十一月二十七日）即作出特別安排。受影響居民可於辦公時間前往入境處辦事處補領香港身份證、特區護照、出生證明書或結婚證書核證副本等個人證件，無須預約，並豁免補領個人證件及申請延長逗留期限的相關費用。為便利受影響的居民，入境處一連三日派員至大埔各臨時庇護中心進行預先登記，並於入境處總部設立為期七天的非辦公時間特別服務時段，專門處理相關申請。入境處除於特別服務時段安排專車接送受影響居民前往將軍澳辦證外，更於48小時內完成製備相關個人證件，並送抵臨時庇護中心以供領取。二○二五年十一月二十七日至十二月底期間，入境處共處理約4350宗補領個人證件相關申請，涉及超過2600名受影響居民。

嚴正執法維護社會穩定

（一）多管齊下打擊非法勞工

入境處一直致力打擊非法勞工，以保障本地勞工的就業機會。保安局於二○二五年九月成立跨部門反黑工專責組（專責組），進一步加大力度打擊非法勞工。入境處作為成員之一，全力支援專責組的工作，透過制定應對非法勞工的整體策略、強化情報搜集及與內地情報交換、嚴厲執法、善用科技，以及協調相關宣傳教育工作等多方面措施，加強跨部門協作，務求多管齊下打擊非法勞工。

（1）嚴厲執法

二○二五年，入境處共進行了19 980次反非法勞工行動，較二○二四年增加約12%。行動中，入境處共拘捕了3 708名非法勞工及569名本地僱主。當中針對打擊非華裔非法勞工的行動，則共拘捕了396名非華裔非法勞工及164名聘用非華裔非法勞工的本地僱主。年內，被定罪的非法勞工大部分被判監，刑期由六天至二十二個月兩星期不等；而被定罪的僱主大部分被判監或罰款，刑期由六星期至六個月不等，罰款金額則由5,000元至60,000元不等。針對不法分子利用網上平台提供跨境「點對點」服務，安排非法勞工在港從事隱蔽性較高的非法工作，入境處持續進行具針對性的網上巡邏，並採取「放蛇」等情報主導的執法行動。假如涉及內地網上平台，入境處會與內地當局交換情報，並促請內地當局與相關平台作適當跟進，例如移除相關帖文。二○二五年，入境處採取了28次「放蛇」行動，合共拘捕33人，包括30名非法勞工及3名協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士。這些非法勞工涉嫌來港提供攝影、化妝、導遊及跨境代購等服務。

（2）加強宣傳教育

入境處一直透過不同渠道進行宣傳教育，包括舉行新聞發布會，派發宣傳單張，以及為不同機構及領事館舉辦講座等，以提升市民對僱用非法勞工刑責的認識。二○二五年十一月，入境處應印尼駐香港總領事館的邀請，為逾180名新來港的印尼籍家庭傭工舉辦專題講座，介紹《入境條例》的相關條文及呼籲外傭切勿從事非法工作。同時，入境處亦積極透過其社交媒體官方帳號，發放反非法勞工行動的最新執法成果。

（3）強化情報搜集

有效收集情報和加強情報分析對打擊非法勞工至關重要。入境處設有多個舉報渠道，包括電話熱線、電郵及網上舉報平台等，供市民舉報有關罪行。二○二五年九月，入境處推出舉報非法勞工專線（3861 5000），並在微信及「智方便」流動應用程式新增舉報功能，以鼓勵市民積極舉報非法勞工相關罪行，共同打擊違法行為。

（二）偵破假結婚個案

入境處設有專案小組，打擊非本港居民透過與香港居民假結婚，以騙取香港居留身份的非法活動。二○二五年，共有39人因涉及假結婚案件而被定罪，分別被判監禁九至22個月不等。同年十一月，入境處與廣東省出入境管理部門展開代號為「閃刺2025」的跨境聯合行動，瓦解了一個跨境假結婚犯罪集團，並於香港及廣東先後拘捕一名集團主腦、三名骨幹成員，以及八名涉嫌假結婚的內地居民。該集團於二○二三至二○二四年間安排超過60宗假結婚，涉案金額超過750萬元。

（三）加強反恐準備、遏止跨國偷渡和打擊行使偽造證件的罪行

入境處人員因應恐怖襲擊的威脅評估及實際情況，在各出入境管制站截查可疑人士，監察懷疑與恐怖主義活動有關連的訪客，以防止有關人士試圖進入香港。二○二五年，入境處在各出入境管制站共進行了13853次反恐相關的巡查行動，截查人次為22 207。為加強部門對突發事件與恐怖襲擊的準備及應變能力，入境處於同年八月參加在啟德郵輪碼頭舉行、代號為「勇光」的大型跨部門反恐演習。此演習旨在測試和提升各部門在處理涉恐涉暴情報，以及應對不同形式恐怖襲擊時的協調及應變能力。此外，入境處一直與各執法機關共同打擊跨國偷渡罪行，重點調查行使偽造證件的罪行，以防止有人使用偽造旅行證件進入香港或經香港前往其他國家及地區。二○二五年，入境處的反偷渡情報局共進行了30 567次打擊偽證行動，當中包括與海外及本地執法機關採取遏止跨國偷渡罪行的聯合行動，共截查了21 064名旅客。

（四）處理免遣返聲請

（1）打擊非華裔人士偷渡

入境處與內地及本地執法機關自二○一六年起展開專項行動，持續打擊非華裔人士非法入境活動。二○二五年每月平均截獲32名非華裔非法入境者，比二○二三年十月高峰期的364名，大幅減少91%。入境處會繼續與內地及澳門執法機關加強情報交流，以更精準打擊偷渡行為。

（2）高效審核

入境處持續透過靈活調配人手及優化工作流程，以加快審核免遣返聲請個案。二○二五年，入境處就超過2 500宗免遣返聲請作出決定；而尚待入境處審核的聲請於去年年底約有650宗。在統一審核機制下，超過95%被入境處拒絕的聲請人會就決定提出上訴。截至二○二五年年底，約有300名聲請人提出的上訴，尚待酷刑聲請上訴委員會／免遣返聲請呈請辦事處作出決定。

（3）加強管理被羈留人士

入境處繼續加強管理被羈留人士，包括等候遣返及免遣返聲請的人士。二○二五年，青山灣入境事務中心（青山灣中心）的新收納人次為6 572，較二○二四年的5 952上升約10%。青山灣中心已開展閉路電視監察系統優化工程，引入影像分析及監察系統，利用人工智能實時分析閉路電視影像。除青山灣中心外，特區政府在二○二一年及二○二三年分别將大潭峽懲教所及勵顧懲教所納入為入境處的羈留地點，使可用作羈留免遣返聲請人的羈留地點增至三個。隨着勵顧懲教所於二○二五年四月初完成原址擴充，整體羈留名額增至940個。入境處會繼續致力善用羈留設施，集中羈留對社會治安有較大風險的聲請人。

（4）提高遣送聲請不獲確立者的效率

入境處一直致力將免遣返聲請不獲確立者盡快遣送離港，以保障公眾利益。二○二五年入境處已遣送2 613名聲請不獲確立者離港，較二○二四年上升18%。為加大遣送力度，入境處於二○二五年十一月六日執行代號為「逐影」的登機押解遣返行動，首次安排聲請不獲確立者搭乘特別專機從香港前往廣州白雲國際機場，再轉乘商業航班前往巴基斯坦，順利於單次行動中強制遣送六名巴基斯坦籍聲請不獲確立者回國。入境處會繼續研究不同可行方案，以加快遣返聲請不獲確立者；同時會與相關單位協調以優化遣返路線，並積極與聲請人主要來源國的政府、航空公司及其他政府部門保持密切聯繫，採取一切合適措施將聲請不獲確立者盡快遣送離港。

強化團隊弘揚愛國主義

（一）人員培訓持續發展

（1）招聘入境事務人員

入境處於二○二五年六月及七月分別展開新一輪的入境事務主任公開招聘活動及內部聘任，而入境事務助理員的公開招聘活動則繼續全年進行。在二○二五年的招聘活動中，入境處聘任約90名入境事務主任及150名入境事務助理員。

（2）國情培訓

為鞏固新入職的入境事務主任對國家安全的觀念，加深其對祖國歷史與發展的認識，並增進對國家出入境制度的了解，在公安部與中國人民警察大學的大力支持下，入境處安排所有入境事務主任學員參與在中國人民警察大學（廣州）舉辦的國情及出入境管理工作培訓班。自二○二五年六月起，該培訓安排亦已涵蓋所有入境事務助理員學員。此外，入境處於二○二五年共安排257名入境事務隊人員前赴多個內地機關參加研修培訓。

（3）「山河永固‧口岸崢嶸──紀念抗戰勝利八十周年國門油畫展」

為紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年和香港回歸祖國28周年，入境處於二○二五年八月至九月在總部公眾大堂舉辦國門油畫展，展出多幅描繪國門及香港特區口岸的油畫作品。展覽吸引眾多市民、青年組織及慈善團體到場參觀，有效推廣愛國主義情懷，增強民族認同感與歸屬感。入境處會繼續積極提升社會大眾對國家安全的認知，並深化屬下人員對祖國歷史與發展的認識。

（二）入境事務處青少年領袖團

入境事務處青少年領袖團為本港青少年提供有系統和恆常的紀律及領袖訓練，培養隊員成為愛國愛港的社會棟樑。截至二○二五年年底，共有超過1 300人參加領袖團。二○二五年五月，領袖團舉行大會操暨隊員晉升典禮，首次由隊員擔任會操指揮官、護旗方隊成員及司儀等崗位；儀仗隊更聯同會操隊伍表演無口令花式步操。年內，領袖團共舉辦五個不同主題的內地交流活動，分別前往海南、黑龍江、四川、廣東潮汕及大灣區等地，讓隊員與內地青年交流，從而加深他們對國家發展的認識。

二○二六年的展望

善用科技提高服務水平

（一）提升通關效率

（1）設立首個「無感通關」試點

入境處將在港珠澳大橋香港口岸設立全港首個「無感通關」試點，讓市民透過人面辨識科技核實身分，實現不停頓過關。「無感通關」先導計劃預計於二○二六年第二季推出，首階段計劃開放予經常使用港珠澳大橋香港口岸的合資格香港居民登記使用，入境處會適時公布有關詳情。

（2）提升管制站的出入境檢查服務

為配合自助過關趨勢及長遠服務需求，入境處將在香港國際機場推出一系列e-道服務的優化措施。由二○二六年第一季起，入境大堂將陸續增設26條全新e-道，並更新現有26條e-道。同時，經常訪港旅客使用e-道服務的登記條件亦會放寬，由現時於過去12個月內經機場訪港三次或以上，放寬至過去24個月內經機場訪港兩次或以上。此外，入境處與香港機場管理局（機管局）將於二○二六年第二季起，將「登機易e-道」服務的適用年齡擴展至7歲或以上，惠及更多離境的的合資格香港居民及旅客。此外，香園圍邊境管制站的首階段優化工程已於二○二五年九月完成，入境及離境大堂的e-道已各增至18條。目前，入境處正計劃開展下一階段的改建工程，進一步增加e-道的數目，從而提升香園圍邊境管制站的通關能力。

（3）優化遊樂船隻出入境安排

特區政府推動遊艇經濟發展的其中一項便利措施，是提升海事處的電子業務系統，容許訪港遊艇可提前一站式提交入境資料。入境處正與海事處合作，計劃透過該系統預先審核訪港遊艇的船員及乘客資料，以縮短辦理出入境檢查手續所需時間。同時，入境處正積極檢討遊樂船隻船員及乘客的出入境安排，並將進行內部系統升級，以優化工作流程。

（二）推進口岸建設

（1）皇崗口岸重建

為配合粵港澳大灣區建設藍圖及促進區內人流和物流暢通，特區政府正積極推進皇崗口岸重建項目。新皇崗口岸將採用「一地兩檢」的安排，實施嶄新的「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式，並成為廣東省與香港特區之間首個採用這種通關模式的口岸。新皇崗口岸將設置134條「合作查驗」自助通道、68個傳統人工櫃枱，以及26個私家車及過境巴士檢查亭。港深雙方正全力推進新皇崗口岸聯檢大樓的建設工程及具體出入境查驗安排等事宜，兩地工程部門亦會以同步施工方式進行大樓內部的工程，並安裝所需設施。入境處和其他相關政策局及部門會繼續與內地當局保持緊密聯繫，積極落實各項相關籌備工作。

（2）沙頭角口岸重建

為提升通關效率，特區政府和深圳市政府於二○二四年達成共識，以「跨河建」的安排重建沙頭角口岸，即雙方同步建設橫跨沙頭角河的旅檢大樓，以河中心為界緊鄰布置各自的旅檢查驗通道。重建後的沙頭角口岸將成為純旅檢口岸，取消貨檢功能，以配合落實跨境貨運「東進東出、西進西出」的布局，並實施「合作查驗、一次放行」的通關模式，以提升旅客過關體驗與效率。特區政府已於二○二五年十二月完成沙頭角口岸重建項目的工程可行性研究，並就相關收回土地建議刊登憲報，以啓動收地程序。入境處會繼續與相關政策局及部門緊密合作，積極推進重建項目。

（3）河套深港科技創新合作區的出入境便利措施

為配合河套深港科技創新合作區的發展，連接港深兩個園區的西面跨河連接橋項目已於二○二五年十二月啓動，以促進兩地創科人員日常頻繁的跨境流動。通關模式方面，為便利兩地創科人員往來，入境處會積極研究使用創新的出入境通關模式，目標是可以讓預先核實資格的人員使用人面識別技術核實身分，從而達致「無感通關」。

（4）機場二號客運大樓

隨着香港國際機場三跑道系統於二○二四年全面投入運作，機場的容量已大幅提升。三跑道系統計劃下的二號客運大樓將按客量需求分階段啓用，其中離境設施將於二○二六年內投入運作。入境處會與機管局及其他相關部門保持緊密聯繫，確保通關設施運作暢順。

（三）科技引領提升服務

Immigration Department Review 2025 (with photos),2026-02-13 19:50,2026-02-13 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300683.htm,"The Director of Immigration, Mr Benson Kwok, held a press conference today (February 13) to review the work of the Immigration Department (ImmD) over the past year and look ahead to the future. The following is a summary of the ImmD's major activities in 2025 and its outlook:

Stay committed to its mission and safeguard national security

As an integral part of the system for safeguarding national security, the ImmD has remained committed to thoroughly adopting the holistic approach to national security with patriotism and love for Hong Kong at its core, firmly guarding the country's southern gateway in strict accordance with all applicable laws and prevailing immigration policies, while striving to protect national sovereignty, security and development interests. It also actively supports the policy deployment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government by unswervingly implementing reforms and promoting innovation, so that the city may take another leap forward ""from stability to prosperity"" and better integrate into the overall national development. This helps reinforce and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international centre in finance, shipping and trade, contributing significantly to its long-term prosperity and stability, as well as social harmony and development.

Enhance efficiency and facilitate connection and integration

(A) Passenger traffic at control points

  In 2025, a total of around 335million passengers passed through Hong Kong's control points, representing an increase of about 12percent over 2024 - a new record high surpassing the 300 million level in 2019. The total number of visitor arrivals was around 49.89million, representing an increase of about 12percent as compared with that of 2024, of which Mainland visitor arrivals were around 37.83million, representing an increase of about 11percent when compared with that of 2024. Meanwhile, the number of arrivals of other visitors was around 12.06million, representing an increase of about 15percent over 2024. Among the visitor arrivals in 2025, around 11.22million visitors travelled through the Airport Control Point, while around 36.87million visitors and around 1.81million visitors passed through land control points and sea control points respectively.

(B) Winning the 2025 Skytrax Award for Best Airport Immigration Service

  In 2025, the ImmD won the Skytrax Award for Best Airport Immigration Service for the fifth time in the World Passenger Survey commissioned by Skytrax, an international specialist research agent of the air transport industry. The survey, covering about 600 airports worldwide, collected ratings from over 13million air passengers of more than 100 countries on the immigration service of various airports. The ImmD will continue to strive for excellence by leveraging innovative technologies to introduce more facilitation measures for visitors and deliver higher-quality immigration services.

(C) Facilitation of people movement

(1) Extension of e-Channel service 

  To further enhance the clearance efficiency of the control points, the ImmD continues to extend the e-Channel service so that more Hong Kong residents and visitors may enjoy fast and convenient self-service immigration clearance. In 2025, for Hong Kong permanent residents holding a smart identity card, transit passengers holding a Chinese electronic ordinary passport, and visitors holding an Electronic Exit-Entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao as well as those using ""Smart Departure"", the eligible age for using the e-Channel service was lowered from 11 to 7 years old. As at the end of 2025, the number of children aged between 7 and 10 using the e-Channels was around 1.08million. Furthermore, the ImmD launched the ""Face Easy e-Channel"" service at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) in September 2025, allowing eligible Hong Kong residents to complete arrival clearance through facial recognition technology, without the need to present any documents or the Contactless e-Channel encrypted QR code throughout the process. As at the end of 2025, the number of eligible Hong Kong residents using the service was around 260000.

(2) Providing immigration facilitation to the 15th National Games 

  The ImmD fully supported the 15th National Games (NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games held in 2025. To facilitate travel among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao for delegations, athletes and staff from various regions during the NG, the ImmD had set up dedicated immigration channels at the control points at HKIA, West Kowloon High Speed Rail Station, Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge and Shenzhen Bay, providing 16 e-Channels in total for registered athletes and related personnel to perform immigration clearance in a self-service manner through facial recognition technology. As for cross-boundary events, the ImmD adopted the innovative pre-clearance inspection and closed-loop management model in collaboration with the National Games Coordination Office, relevant government departments, as well as immigration authorities of the Mainland and Macao to achieve zero delay, zero contact, and zero waiting time during immigration clearance. Close communication was maintained throughout so that a cross-boundary road cycling event and marathon event were conducted seamlessly and smoothly.

Trawl for talent to enhance Hong Kong as an international hub for talent

  Adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC Central Committee), the Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on Further Deepening Reform Comprehensively to Advance Chinese Modernization supports Hong Kong's position to become an international hub for high-calibre talent. Also, as announced in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, Hong Kong Talent Engage will strengthen its efforts in talent attraction and support, with a view to attracting more talent to pursue development in Hong Kong. In support of the HKSAR Government's proactive measures to attract and retain talent, the ImmD continues to implement various enhanced talent admission schemes. In January 2025, the ImmD further stepped up its electronic services for visa applications by allowing applicants to complete the entire application process through the ImmD mobile application, the ImmD's website or the GovHK website, without having to visit an Immigration office in person. For details of the numbers of applications for visas/entry permits/extension of stay received and approved under various admission schemes/policies, please refer to the Annex.

(A) Enhancing talent admission schemes

(1) Admitting professionals of specified skilled trades and updating the Talent List 

  The HKSAR Government introduced a new channel under the General Employment Policy (GEP) and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) in June 2025, allowing outside individuals to apply for entry into Hong Kong to join the eight skilled trades facing acute manpower shortages as listed on the Technical Professional List. This arrangement will be piloted for three years with an overall application quota of 10000, and the application quota for each skilled trade is limited to 3000. Applicants must meet the requirements as stated in the Technical Professional List and be aged between 18 and 40. Depending on the specific skilled trade and the applicant's qualifications, the first entry visa is normally valid for 24 or 36 months. Furthermore, the updated Talent List took effect in March 2025 with nine newly added professions, covering a total of 60 professions with local talent shortages. Outside talent meeting the eligibility criteria for relevant professions can enjoy immigration facilitation when applying for admission under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS), the GEP and the ASMTP.

(2) Launching further enhancement measures for the Technology Talent Admission Scheme 

  The HKSAR Government launched further enhancement measures for the Technology Talent Admission Scheme (TechTAS) on December 24, 2025. They include streamlining application procedures to allow technology companies and eligible talent to submit applications for quotas and visas/entry permits in parallel; lifting the requirement for engaging in research and development (R&D) activities in the 14 designated technology areas; and launching a dedicated application channel for the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park. These measures enable eligible companies to expedite recruitment of innovation and technology (I&T) talent from around the world and facilitate their technology-related R&D activities in Hong Kong, thereby fostering Hong Kong's I&T development.

(3) Immigration facilitation schemes for persons participating in arbitral proceedings and short-term activities in designated sectors 

  The HKSAR Government regularised and refined the Pilot Scheme on Facilitation for Persons Participating in Arbitral Proceedings in Hong Kong in March 2025, and renamed it the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Persons Participating in Arbitral Proceedings in Hong Kong. The refined scheme now covers five categories of eligible persons as well as all arbitrations physically taking place in Hong Kong. Moreover, the HKSAR Government further expanded the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors in November 2025 to cover five new sectors in addition to the original 12 designated sectors. More authorised organisations and specified short-term activities have also been included. This allows more non-local talent to participate in specified short-term activities in Hong Kong as visitors without the need to apply for an employment visa/entry permit.

(B) Launching the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Invited Persons

The HKSAR Government launched the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Invited Persons in March 2025 to provide more convenient immigration arrangements for invited persons from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, in order to promote economic and trade exchanges and cultural co-operation between Hong Kong and ASEAN. Under the Scheme, relevant bureaux/departments will actively invite ASEAN nationals who can make considerable contributions to Hong Kong's economic development, or those who have been invited to attend important events in Hong Kong to enjoy immigration facilitation. The ImmD will process the applications from these invited persons through a one-stop electronic platform, relax the application criteria for self-service immigration clearance, and simplify the information required for visa applications.

(C) Relaxing visa arrangements for nationals of the Belt and Road countries

  To reinforce Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, the ImmD has relaxed the visa arrangements in respect of various Belt and Road countries. Since January 2025, the visa-free period for nationals of Saudi Arabia to visit Hong Kong for travel has been extended from 30 days to 90 days. Moreover, starting from September 2025, the ImmD relaxed the criteria for nationals of four Central Asian countries (namely Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) applying for multiple-entry visas to Hong Kong for business and travel purposes, with a view to promoting economic and trade as well as tourism development between Hong Kong and Central Asia.

Be people-oriented and improve livelihoods in pursuit of happiness

(A) Conclusion of Territory-wide Identity Card Replacement Exercise and invalidation of old form of smart identity cards

  Following the conclusion of the Territory-wide Identity Card Replacement Exercise on March 3, 2023, all Smart Identity Card Replacement Centres have ceased to operate and the On-site Identity Card Replacement Service also concluded in the first quarter of 2025. The old form of smart identity cards issued before November 26, 2018, became invalid in two phases in 2025. As well, the Registration of Persons (ROP) - Kwun Tong (Temporary) Office, which was established to meet the post-pandemic demand for identity card replacement, also ceased to operate in October 2025 as planned. After its closure, members of the public may still visit the other six ROP Offices for identity card applications. As at the end of 2025, a total of some 7.46 million identity card holders had replaced their smart identity cards. The replacement rate was about 93 per cent.

(B) Issue of HKSAR passports and visa-free access for their holders 

  In 2025, the ImmD issued a total of more than 700 000 HKSAR passports. In January 2025, the ImmD announced that HKSAR passport holders may apply for single-entry or multiple-entry tourist visas upon arrival at six designated control points in Saudi Arabia. From May 2025 onwards, HKSAR passport holders may visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates visa-free for a stay of up to 30 days, and the visa-free period for visiting the Sultanate of Oman has also been extended from 10 days to 14 days. In November 2025, the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria agreed to grant visa-free access to HKSAR passport holders for a stay of up to 14 days. As at the end of 2025, a total of 174 countries or territories had granted visa-free access or visa-on-arrival to HKSAR passport holders. The ImmD will continue to lobby more countries or territories to grant visa-free access or a visa-on-arrival to HKSAR passport holders to provide greater travel convenience.

(C) Services and support for Hong Kong residents in distress outside Hong Kong

(1) Assistance to Hong Kong residents in distress outside Hong Kong

  The ImmD's Assistance to Hong Kong Residents Unit (AHU) has been making every effort to provide assistance to Hong Kong residents in distress outside Hong Kong. The AHU maintains close contact with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR (OCMFA), Chinese diplomatic and consular missions overseas and other relevant HKSAR government departments to provide all practicable assistance to those in need. In 2025, the AHU handled 3 388 requests for assistance in total, most of which involved loss of travel documents, hospitalisation or casualties, etc outside Hong Kong. In addition, the ImmD continued to follow up on cases of Hong Kong residents suspected of being lured to Southeast Asian countries and detained to engage in illegal work. Between January and March 2025, officers of the ImmD and members of the Security Bureau's dedicated task force visited Thailand four times to assist the residents concerned in returning to Hong Kong. Following a severe earthquake in Myanmar in March 2025, the HKSAR Government deployed a search and rescue team, including two ImmD officers, to a quake-stricken area to assist in the search and rescue work. This was the second overseas rescue operation conducted by the HKSAR Government since the earthquake in Türkiye in 2023. In June 2025, amid the escalating tension between Iran and Israel, the ImmD received enquiries from 21 Hong Kong residents in Iran, Israel and Jordan. In this connection, the ImmD has maintained close contact with the OCMFA and relevant Chinese embassies to render all practical assistance to the persons concerned according to their wishes. Eventually, 20 Hong Kong residents left the area concerned safely, while the remaining Hong Kong resident reported as safe and required no further assistance.

(2) Publicity on consular protection and outbound travel safety

  In 2025, the ImmD and the OCMFA continued to co-organise a series of activities to widely publicise information on consular protection and outbound travel safety. These included organising roving exhibitions at the Immigration Headquarters and across the territory, as well as setting up booths at travel expos, among others. To deepen the understanding of the younger generation on consular protection and strengthen their sense of belonging to the country, the ImmD produced its first-ever illustrated book for children on consular protection and outbound travel safety. The book launch was held in June 2025. Physical copies of the book have been distributed to over 1 500 primary schools and kindergartens across the territory, and are also available for loan at public libraries in various districts. The electronic version of the book has also been uploaded to the websites of the Education Bureau and the ImmD, enabling students to learn about consular protection and outbound travel safety in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.

(D) Arrangements for personal document replacement and extension of stay for residents affected by the Tai Po fire 

  To fully support the residents affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the ImmD promptly activated special arrangements on November 27, 2025, the day immediately following the incident. Affected residents could visit Immigration offices during office hours without a prior appointment to apply for replacement of personal documents, such as Hong Kong identity cards, HKSAR passports, certified copies of birth certificates or marriage certificates. All fees in relation to the replacement of personal documents and application for extension of stay were waived. To provide further facilitation to the affected residents, the ImmD deployed officers to various temporary shelters in Tai Po for three consecutive days to conduct pre-registrations, and additionally set up a special service session at the Immigration Headquarters outside office hours for seven days to specifically process the relevant applications. The ImmD not only provided dedicated transport during the special service session to transfer the affected residents to and from Tseung Kwan O for replacement of personal documents, but also expedited processing to prepare the relevant personal documents within 48 hours, delivering them back to the temporary shelters for collection. Between November 27, 2025, and the end of December 2025, the ImmD processed about 4350 applications for replacement of relevant personal documents in total, involving over 2600 affected residents.

Enforce law stringently and secure social stability

(A) Multipronged approach to combat illegal employment

  The ImmD has been sparing no effort in combating illegal employment to safeguard job opportunities for the local workforce. The Security Bureau established the Inter-departmental Task Force against Illegal Employment (Task Force) in September 2025 to step up efforts in combating illegal employment. As a member of the Task Force, the ImmD has fully supported its work in enhancing interdepartmental collaboration on various fronts by formulating overall response strategies against illegal employment, strengthening intelligence collection and intelligence exchanges with the Mainland, enforcing the laws rigorously, leveraging technology, and co-ordinating relevant publicity and education efforts, with a view to combating illegal employment through a multipronged approach.

(1) Rigorous law enforcement

  In 2025, the ImmD conducted a total of 19 980 operations against illegal employment activities, representing an increase of about 12 per cent when compared with that of 2024. During these operations, the ImmD arrested 3 708 illegal workers and 569 local employers altogether. In particular, a total of 396 non-ethnic Chinese illegal workers and 164 locals who employed them were arrested during the enforcement operations against non-ethnic Chinese illegal workers. During the year, the majority of the convicted illegal workers were sentenced to imprisonment with terms ranging from six days to 22 months and two weeks, whereas most of the convicted employers were sentenced to imprisonment or fines with terms ranging from six weeks to six months and fines ranging from $5,000 to $60,000. In response to lawbreakers who, through online platforms, offer cross-boundary ""point-to-point"" services and arrange for illegal workers to work in Hong Kong in a relatively discreet manner, the ImmD has conducted constant targeted cyber patrols and taken intelligence-led enforcement actions such as decoy operations. If Mainland online platforms are involved, the ImmD will exchange intelligence with the Mainland authorities and urge them to arrange with the relevant platforms for taking appropriate follow-up actions, such as removing the posts involved. In 2025, the ImmD conducted 28 decoy operations, leading to the arrest of a total of 33 persons, including 30 illegal workers and three persons who aided and abetted others to take up illegal employment. These illegal workers were suspected of coming to Hong Kong to provide photography, make-up, tour guide and cross-boundary purchase services.

(2) Stepping up publicity and education

  The ImmD has been conducting publicity and education through various channels, including holding press conferences, distributing promotional leaflets, and arranging seminars for different organisations and consulates in order to raise public awareness of the criminal liability for employing illegal workers. In November 2025, the ImmD held a themed seminar for over 180 newly arrived Indonesian domestic helpers at the invitation of the Consulate General of the Republic of Indonesia in Hong Kong, explaining the relevant provisions of the Immigration Ordinance and reminding foreign domestic helpers not to take up any illegal employment. The ImmD has also actively disseminated the latest enforcement results of anti-illegal worker operations through its official social media accounts.

(3) Strengthening intelligence collection

  Effective intelligence collection and enhanced intelligence analysis are crucial in combating illegal employment. The ImmD has established multiple reporting channels, including a telephone hotline, and an email and online reporting platform for members of the public to report related offences. In September 2025, the ImmD launched the Dedicated Hotline for Reporting Illegal Workers (3861 5000), and provided a new reporting function on WeChat and the ""iAM Smart"" mobile application to encourage the public to actively report illegal employment related crimes and work together to combat unlawful acts.

(B) Detection of bogus marriages

  The ImmD has set up a special task force to carry out enforcement actions against non-Hong Kong residents obtaining residency by means of contracting bogus marriages with Hong Kong residents. In 2025, a total of 39 persons were convicted of bogus marriage-related offences and sentenced to imprisonment ranging from nine to 22 months. In November 2025, the ImmD mounted a cross-boundary joint operation codenamed ""Flashspear 2025"" with the immigration authorities of Guangdong Province, neutralising a cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate. The mastermind and three core members of the syndicate, as well as eight Mainlanders suspected to have contracted bogus marriages, were arrested in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The syndicate was found to have arranged more than 60 bogus marriages between 2023 and 2024, involving transactions amounting to over $7.5 million.

(C) Strengthening counter-terrorism preparedness, combating illegal transnational migration and document fraud

  The ImmD Officers intercepted suspicious persons at immigration control points in the light of terrorist threat assessments and actual circumstances, and kept visitors in suspected association with terrorist activities under surveillance to prevent such persons from attempting to enter Hong Kong. In 2025, the ImmD conducted a total of 13 853 related inspection operations at various immigration control points with 22 207 passengers intercepted for enquiries. To enhance its preparedness and response capabilities for emergencies and terrorist attacks, the ImmD participated in a large-scale interdepartmental counter-terrorism exercise codenamed ""BRAVELIGHT"" at the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal in August 2025. The exercise aimed to test and enhance the co-ordination and response capabilities of various departments in dealing with terrorism-related as well as riot-related intelligence and responses to different forms of terrorist attacks. Moreover, the ImmD has been working with different law enforcement agencies to combat illegal transnational migration, with the focus on investigations into document fraud, in order to prevent anyone from entering Hong Kong or travelling to other countries or territories via Hong Kong with forged travel documents. In 2025, the ImmD's Anti-Illegal Migration Agency conducted a total of 30 567 operations against forgery activities, including joint operations with overseas and local law enforcement agencies against illegal transnational migration. A total of 21 064 passengers were intercepted for enquiries.

(D) Handling non-refoulement claims

(1) Combating the illegal entry of non-ethnic Chinese

   The ImmD has commenced dedicated operations with the Mainland and local law enforcement agencies since 2016 in order to take sustained enforcement action against illegal immigration activities of non-ethnic Chinese. The number of interceptions plummeted by 91 per cent from the peak of 364 in October 2023 to a monthly average of 32 in 2025. The ImmD will continue to step up intelligence exchanges with enforcement agencies on the Mainland and in Macao to further combat illegal immigration precisely.

(2) Screening with high efficiency

  The ImmD continued to speed up the screening of non-refoulement claims with flexible staff deployments and optimised workflows. In 2025, the ImmD determined over 2 500 non-refoulement claims. As at the end of last year, there were about 650 claims pending screening by the ImmD. Under the unified screening mechanism, over 95 per cent of the claimants rejected by the ImmD lodged appeals against the decisions. As at the end of 2025, there were about 300 claimants who had lodged appeals pending decision by the Torture Claims Appeal Board/Non-refoulement Claims Petition Office.

(3) Better management of detainees

  The ImmD continued to strengthen the management of detainees, including those pending removal and non-refoulement claimants. In 2025, the number of new detainees to the Castle Peak Bay Immigration Centre (CIC) was 6 572, representing a rise of about 10 per cent from 5 952 in 2024. The CIC has commenced work on a CCTV surveillance system enhancement, with the introduction of a Video Analytic Monitoring System that leverages AI to perform real-time analysis of CCTV footage. In addition to the CIC, the HKSAR Government included the Tai Tam Gap Correctional Institution and the Nei Kwu Correctional Institution (NKCI) as places of detention of the ImmD in 2021 and 2023 respectively, thereby increasing the number of detention places for detaining non-refoulement claimants to three. Following the completion of the NKCI's in-situ expansion in early April 2025, the overall detention capacity was increased to 940. The ImmD will remain committed to making good use of the detention facilities to detain claimants who pose higher risks to the security of the community.

(4) Enhancing efficiency of removing unsubstantiated claimants

  The ImmD has been committed to promptly removing unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants from Hong Kong to safeguard the public interest. In 2025, the ImmD removed 2 613 unsubstantiated claimants from Hong Kong, representing a rise of 18 per cent when compared with that in 2024. To enhance removal efforts, the ImmD carried out an in-flight escort repatriation operation codenamed ""Expel"" on November 6, 2025. For the first time, the ImmD arranged a special chartered flight from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport for unsubstantiated claimants, with an onward transfer to Pakistan aboard a commercial flight. This resulted in the successful forced removal of six Pakistani unsubstantiated claimants to their home country in a single operation. The ImmD will continue to explore different feasible solutions to expedite the repatriation of unsubstantiated claimants. Meanwhile, it will also co-ordinate with relevant authorities to optimise repatriation routes while actively maintaining close liaison with governments, airline companies and other government departments of major source countries of the claimants, with a view to removing unsubstantiated claimants from Hong Kong as soon as practicable through all appropriate measures.
   
Strengthen the corps and promote patriotism 

(A) Staff training and continuous development

(1) Recruitment of service members

  The ImmD launched a new round of open recruitment and in-service appointments of Immigration Officers in June and July 2025 respectively, while the open recruitment of Immigration Assistants continued to be conducted year round. During the recruitment exercises in 2025, the department recruited about 90 Immigration Officers and 150 Immigration Assistants.

(2) National studies

   In order to reinforce the concept of national security among newly recruited Immigration Officers, deepen their understanding of the history and development of the motherland as well as enhance their knowledge of the country's immigration regime, with the staunch support of the Ministry of Public Security and the China People's Police University, the ImmD has arranged all Immigration Officer trainees to participate in the National Affairs and Immigration Control Training Course at the China People's Police University (Guangzhou). Since June 2025, such training arrangements have been made to cover all Immigration Assistant trainees. Moreover, a total of 257 members of the Immigration Service were arranged to attend training courses in various Mainland institutes in 2025.

(3) Oil painting exhibition commemorating 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance

  In commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and in the World Anti-Fascist War and the 28th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the ImmD hosted an oil painting exhibition at the public lobby of its headquarters from August to September 2025. The exhibition, showcasing a number of oil paintings depicting the nation's gateways and the control points of the HKSAR, drew many public visitors, as well as various youth organisations and charitable groups. It effectively promoted patriotic sentiments and strengthened a sense of national identity and belonging. The ImmD will continue to actively foster public awareness of national security and deepen its staff members' understanding of the history and development of the motherland.

(B) Immigration Department Youth Leaders Corps

   The Immigration Department Youth Leaders Corps (IDYL) provides systematic and regular disciplinary and leadership training with the aim of nurturing its members to become pillars of society who love the country and Hong Kong. As the end of 2025, a total of over 1300 students participated in the IDYL. In May 2025, the IDYL held the Grand Parade and Promotion Ceremony, where members themselves took on roles such as Parade Commander, members of the Flag Party and Master of Ceremony for the first time. The Guard of Honour also performed a silent footdrill together with the parade. During the year, the IDYL organised a total of five exchange programmes to the Mainland with different themes, including trips to Hainan, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Chaoshan in Guangdong and the Greater Bay Area. These exchange programmes facilitated members' exchanges with Mainland youths, thereby deepening their understanding of the country's development.

Vision for 2026

Utilise technologies to enhance service standards

(A) Enhancing clearance efficiency

(1) Establishment of the first ""contactless clearance"" pilot checkpoint

  The ImmD will establish Hong Kong's first ""contactless clearance"" pilot checkpoint at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port, which enables people's identity verification through facial recognition technology, thereby achieving unimpeded immigration clearance. The ""contactless clearance"" pilot scheme is anticipated for launch in the second quarter of 2026, with the initial phase proposed to be open for enrolment by eligible Hong Kong residents who frequently use the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port. Details will be announced in due course.

(2) Enhancement of immigration clearance service at control points

  To align with the trend towards self-service clearance and meet long-term service demands, the ImmD will introduce a series of enhancement measures on the e-Channel service at HKIA. Starting from the first quarter of 2026, a total of 26 new additional e-Channels will be installed gradually at the arrival hall, and the existing 26 e-Channels will be replaced progressively. At the same time, the eligibility criteria for frequent visitors to enrol for the e-Channel service will be relaxed, from having visited Hong Kong via HKIA for no fewer than three times in the past 12 months at present, to no fewer than two times in the past 24 months. The ImmD and the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) will extend the applicable age of the Flight Token e-Channel service to 7 years old or above from the second quarter of 2026 onwards to benefit more departing eligible Hong Kong residents and visitors. Furthermore, the first phase of the enhancement works at Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point was completed in September 2025, increasing the number of e-Channels to 18 both at the arrival and departure halls. The ImmD is planning for the next phase of alteration works to further increase the number of e-Channels, with a view to enhancing the clearance capacity of the Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point.

(3) Enhancement of immigration clearance arrangements for pleasure vessels

  One of the convenient measures promoted by the HKSAR government to develop the yacht economy is the enhancement of the electronic business system of the Marine Department (MD), which allows visiting yachts to submit arrival information in advance through a one-stop service. The ImmD is working with the MD on the proposal to conduct preliminary vetting of the information of the crew and passengers of visiting yachts by using the system, thereby shortening the time for immigration clearance. Meanwhile, the ImmD is actively reviewing the immigration arrangements for crew and passengers of pleasure vessels and will carry out internal system upgrades to optimise the workflow.

(B) Upgrading the infrastructure of boundary control points

(1) Redevelopment of Huanggang Port

  To tie in with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development blueprint and facilitate smooth and efficient people and cargo flows within the area, the HKSAR Government has been forging ahead with the Huanggang Port redevelopment project. The new Huanggang Port will adopt the co-location arrangementand implement the new clearance mode of ""collaborative inspection and joint clearance"", making it the first boundary control point between Guangdong Province and the HKSAR adopting such a clearance mode. It will be equipped with 134 ""collaborative inspection"" automated channels, 68 traditional manual counters, and 26 clearance kiosks for private cars and cross-boundary coaches. Hong Kong and Shenzhen are dedicating efforts to take forward matters such as construction works of the new Huanggang Port building and specific immigration clearance arrangements. The works departments of both sides will also undertake interior works and install necessary facilities through a concurrent approach. The ImmD, together with other relevant bureaux and departments, will continue to maintain close liaison with the relevant Mainland authorities to proactively implement all relevant preparatory work.

(2) Redevelopment of Sha Tau Kok Control Point

  To enhance clearance efficiency, the HKSAR Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government have reached a consensus in 2024 on adopting a cross-river construction approach in the redevelopment of the Sha Tau Kok (STK) Control Point. Accordingly, the two sides will concurrently construct the passenger clearance building straddling the STK River and will take the centre line of the river as the boundary line to set up their respective passenger clearance channels immediately adjacent to each other. The redeveloped STK Control Point will become a passenger clearance-only control point, with the cargo clearance function cancelled, in order to facilitate the implementation of the ""East in East out, West in West out"" planning strategy for cross-boundary goods traffic. It will also implement the ""collaborative inspection and joint clearance"" mode to enhance passenger clearance experience and efficiency. The HKSAR Government completed in December 2025 the engineering feasibility study for the STK Control Point redevelopment project, and published in the gazette the relevant land resumption proposal with a view to initiating the land resumption process. The ImmD will continue to collaborate with relevant bureaux and departments to actively take forward the redevelopment project.

(3) Immigration facilitation measures for the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone

  To dovetail with the development of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, the ""Western Cross-River Link Bridge Project"" connecting the two parks in Hong Kong and Shenzhen commenced in December 2025, effectively facilitating the frequent day-to-day cross-boundary flow of I&T personnel. Regarding immigration clearance, to enable the cross-boundary movement of I&T personnel, the ImmD will actively explore the adoption of innovative and convenient clearance modes. The target is to enable pre-verified individuals to enjoy a contactless clearance experience through the use of facial recognition technology.

(4) Airport Terminal 2

  With the full commissioning of the Three-Runway System (3RS) of HKIA in 2024, the airport capacity has been substantially enhanced. Terminal 2 under the 3RS project will be opened in phases based on passenger traffic demand, with its departure facilities set to commence operation in 2026. The ImmD will maintain close communication with the AAHK and other relevant departments to ensure the smooth running of clearance facilities.

(C) Leading with technology to enhance services

(1) Implementing the Fourth Information Systems Strategy

   The ImmD commissioned a consultant in August 2024 to conduct a study of the Fourth Information Systems Strategy, with a view to formulating a blueprint for the department's long-term information technology development. It is recommended that the ImmD should leverage innovative technologies and AI more effectively, and replace the existing information systems in a timely manner to further enhance work efficiency and cost-effectiveness while meeting future development needs. In view of the strategic recommendations, the ImmD has initiated a feasibility study on the new generation of immigration control systems, exploring ways to introduce an innovative self-service clearance mode and further extend the e-Channel service to improve clearance efficiency and strengthen immigration control. Furthermore, the ImmD will harness AI technology to analyse and monitor data such as passenger and vehicular flows. This will facilitate flexible manpower deployment and enhance resource utilisation, thereby ensuring smooth operation at the control points.

(2) Expanding the service scope of the personal documentation kiosks

  Personal Documentation Submission Kiosks and Personal Documentation Collection Kiosks are provided at the Immigration Headquarters for eligible persons to apply for identity card replacements in a self-service manner and submit their HKSAR passport applications in one go, without having to make any appointments. The services have gained popularity among the public, earning the ImmD's Self-application Services Team recognition in The Ombudsman's Awards 2025 for Teams of Public Organisations - a newly introduced award that recognises excellence in enhancing the quality of public services. The ImmD plans to expand the service scope of the personal documentation kiosks in phases starting from the first half of 2026 by processing applications for replacement of identity cards and HKSAR passports due to loss, adjusting the eligible age for use and introducing services such as replacement and collection of Documents of Identity for Visa Purposes, among others, so that more Hong Kong residents may enjoy the convenience brought by the personal documentation kiosks. Relevant details will be announced in due course.

(3) Stepping up efforts to combat immigration-related technology and cybercrimes

  To effectively combat emerging immigration-related technology and cybercrimes, and enhance enforcement efficiency, the ImmD is continuously improving its digital forensics capabilities, including actively recruiting and training talent, procuring sophisticated and specialised equipment, and establishing its first digital forensics laboratory. Meanwhile, the ImmD is also developing a new analytics system to consolidate and analyse data and information from various online platforms for conducting automated cyber patrols across multiple platforms. These help strengthen the ImmD's capacity in cybercrime investigations and digital evidence collection on all fronts.

(D) Enhancing arrangements for extension of stay applications in respect of various talent admission schemes

  With effect from March 1, 2026, persons permitted to work or reside in Hong Kong under the GEP, ASMTP, TechTAS, Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates, QMAS, and Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents, as well as their dependants, may submit early applications for an extension of stay within three months prior to the expiry of their limit of stay. The arrangement is applicable to the Top Talent Pass Scheme since November 1, 2024. The new arrangement allows applicants under various talent admission schemes more time to prepare for and submit their extension of stay applications, thereby further facilitating their stay in Hong Kong for development."

HKETO Berlin promotes Hong Kong's vibrant capital market in Frankfurt (with photos),2026-02-13 19:45,2026-02-13 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300579.htm,"  The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, Berlin (HKETO Berlin) promoted the unique advantages of Hong Kong as an international financial centre at the Frankfurt Digital Finance conference held in Frankfurt, Germany, on February 11 and 12 (Frankfurt time).

  The Frankfurt Digital Finance is a two-day international conference dedicated to accelerating innovation and advancing the digital transformation of Europe's financial industry. Around 1 500 decision-makers across Europe attended the conference, including government officials, leaders from banks, regulators, investment and academia sectors.

  The Director of HKETO Berlin, Mr Indiana Wong, attended a panel discussion titled ""Transformation and Venture Capital: The Role of Public and Private Players for Accelerating Digital Growth"". He discussed Hong Kong's crucial role as a ""super connector"" between the Chinese Mainland and the world, promoting the stable business and investment environment that makes Hong Kong a vital market for global investors amid complex geopolitical tensions and digital transformation.

  ""Under the 'one country, two systems' framework, Hong Kong has unique advantages, such as high connectivity with China and the free flow of capital. The Hong Kong financial market delivered a strong performance in 2025. The initial public offering market raised over HK$280 billion, placing Hong Kong at the top of fund-raising rankings and reflecting investors' confidence in Hong Kong,"" said Mr Wong.

  Mr Wong also promoted the vast potential and opportunities provided by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area market. Hong Kong serves a dual flow of trade and investments, bringing companies from Europe to China and Hong Kong on the one hand, and bringing enterprises in China and Hong Kong to go global on the other. He encouraged German enterprises to set up or expand businesses in Hong Kong as a gateway to access to the Greater China market. He also introduced the strengths of Hong Kong's cross-sector professional services, which could support enterprises on the Chinese Mainland in expanding globally.

  The Investment Promotion Unit of HKETO Berlin and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council Frankfurt Office also participated in the European Fintech Day held on the second day of the conference, promoting the vibrant fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong."

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2026-02-13 19:13,2026-02-13 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300677.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 13) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF). The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminds the public that temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions (including neighbouring Southeast Asian countries) remain favourable for mosquito breeding. When travelling to areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, the public should take measures to prevent mosquito bites, including wearing loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and applying insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body.

Dengue fever
----------------

  From February 6 to yesterday (February 12), the CHP recorded one imported DF case, involving a 22-year-old female who lived in the Philippines. A preliminary investigation revealed that she travelled to Hong Kong with her family on February 3. She developed a fever, headache, cough and vomiting on February 4 and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department (A&E) of Kwong Wah Hospital the following day. She developed shortness of breath and chest pain on February 6 and returned to the A&E of Kwong Wah Hospital on February 7, where she was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment. She remained in critical condition after admission. She was clinically diagnosed with shock and multi-organ failure, and passed away on February 8. The patient's blood sample tested positive for the dengue virus upon laboratory testing subsequently. As the patient stayed in the Philippines during the whole incubation period, the case was classified as imported. Six family members who travelled to Hong Kong with her have not shown any symptoms and are currently under medical surveillance.

  Dengue virus encompasses four different serotypes. After recovering from an infection with one serotype, a person will develop lifelong immunity to that serotype. However, cross-immunity to the other three serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. It is therefore possible to have subsequent infections with other serotypes of dengue virus. Subsequent infections with other serotypes of dengue virus are at a higher risk of severe dengue, including severe complications such as bleeding and shock. DF is endemic in the Philippines with all four serotypes co-circulating. The CHP does not rule out the possibility that this patient's infection this time was a second infection with a different serotype, leading to severe complications. The CHP will conduct further testing on the patient's clinical sample.

  As of yesterday, seven imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 59 DF cases were recorded last year (2025), all of which were imported cases.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over 4 million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths were reported in 97 countries/territories.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. In 2025, Indonesia, India and Vietnam each recorded over 120 000 cases; Malaysia and Thailand each recorded over 50 000 cases; and Singapore also recorded over 4 000 cases.Meanwhile, the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention recorded over 3 500 locally infected cases in Guangdong Province in 2025.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

  As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

​
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Over 15.1 million suspected illicit cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $68 million and a duty potential of about $50 million were seized. Fifty-nine persons were arrested.

During the operation, Customs officers detected 58 relevant cases in various districts and seized the above-mentioned suspected illicit cigarettes. In those cases, Customs officers raided 10 suspected illicit cigarette storage centres in Kwun Tong, To Kwa Wan, Tsuen Wan, Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi, Yuen Long, Tin Shui Wai, San Tin and North Point, and two suspected illicit cigarette storage centres in public rental housing (PRH) units in Sau Mau Ping and Ngau Tau Kok, and detained five vehicles suspected to be used for illicit cigarette distribution. Forty-eight men and 11 women, aged between 21 and 86, including both illicit cigarette sellers and buyers, were arrested. All the cases have been duly followed up.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement to vigorously combat illicit cigarette activities during festive periods through risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling.

If PRH units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the Housing Department after the conclusion of court proceedings under the existing mechanism for follow-up action in accordance with the tenancy agreement or the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement, and the PRH tenancy may be terminated.

Customs stresses that it is an offence to buy or sell illicit cigarettes. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Hong Kong Customs detects suspected food smuggling case (with photos),2026-02-13 18:30,2026-02-13 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300578.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on February 11 detected a suspected food smuggling case and seized approximately 4 800 kilograms of suspected illegally imported food with a total estimated market value of about $400,000.

Hong Kong Customs, based on intelligence analysis, speculated that some persons would illegally import frozen meat into Hong Kong from the Chinese Mainland side of Chung Ying Street in Sha Tou Kok. Customs officers on that day took action and intercepted a male suspected of illegally importing frozen meat into Hong Kong and two suspicious vehicles, and searched a warehouse. The batch of suspected smuggled food, including 1 200kg of frozen meat and 3 600kg of other food items, was seized during the operation.

During the operation, Hong Kong Customs arrested a male suspected of illegally importing frozen meat into Hong Kong, two male truck drivers and a female warehouse manager, aged between 38 and 61. They have been released on bail pending further investigation.

Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Under the Import and Export (General) Regulations, it is an offence to import frozen or chilled meat into Hong Kong without an import licence issued by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD). An offender shall be liable on conviction to a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

According to the Imported Game, Meat, Poultry and Eggs Regulations (Cap. 132AK), it is an offence to bring any game, meat, poultry or eggs into Hong Kong without a health certificate issued by an issuing entity of the place of origin and/or without prior written permission granted by the FEHD. An offender shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and to imprisonment for six months.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

是次聯合行動中，食環署人員重點巡查持牌食物製造廠業的整體衞生情況及其處所的經營業務模式，並就違反牌照條件及違規經營食肆的情況採取嚴厲執法行動。行動期間，食環署人員共向相關持牌食物業處所提出20宗檢控，當中18宗涉及食物業處所違規經營食肆、一宗在未得到准許管有限制出售食物以供出售及一宗食物業處所設備不潔的檢控，並就違反相關牌照條件的情況作出24次口頭警告飭令糾正，如違規情況持續會取消牌照。

消防處亦在行動中派出多個單位，重點檢查大廈公用地方及持牌處所的消防安全狀況，以消除潛在消防隱患，保障公眾安全。消防處人員分別在大廈的公用地方及部分持牌食物製造廠內，發現共七宗違反《消防（消除火警危險）規例》（第95F章）的情況，包括逃生途徑被阻塞，以及消防裝置及設備被移除。處方已就違規事項發出六張「消除火警危險通知書」，並將會就一宗阻塞逃生途徑的個案提出檢控。消防處將繼續透過執法、宣傳及跨部門協作等多管齊下的方式，與各界攜手推動消防安全文化，共同營造更安全、更可靠的社區環境。

發言人強調，食環署會繼續加強巡查全港各區食物業處所，以確保持牌人遵守牌照條件和法例規定，並會按《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章）及其附屬法例對違規情況嚴厲執法。"

During this joint operation, FEHD officers focused on inspecting the overall hygienic conditions and mode of business operation of the licensed food factories and carrying out stringent enforcement actions against any breaches of licensing conditions and illegal operation of restaurant business. During the operation, FEHD officers initiated 20 prosecutions against the incriminated licensed food premises, including 18 prosecutions against food business premises for operating restaurant businesses illegally, one prosecution against possession of restricted food for sale without permission, and one prosecution against dirty equipment in food premises, and issued 24 verbal warnings against breaches of licensing conditions for which the licences will be cancelled if the violations continue.

During the operation, the FSD also deployed multiple units to target the fire safety conditions of the common areas and licensed premises within the building, with a view to eliminating potential fire hazards and ensuring public safety. The FSD personnel identified seven violations of the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation (Cap. 95F) in the common areas of the subject building and in some of the licensed food factories respectively. Those violations included obstruction of means of escape, as well as removal of fire service installations or equipment. The FSD has issued six Fire Hazard Abatement Notices regarding the irregularities and will institute one prosecution for obstruction of means of escape. The FSD will continue to work with all parties to promote a fire safety culture and jointly build a safer and more resilient community through a multipronged approach, including enforcement, publicity and interdepartmental collaboration.

A spokesperson stressed that the FEHD will continue to strengthen inspections of food premises across all districts, to ensure the compliance with licensing conditions and legal requirement by the licensees, and will take stringent enforcement actions against contraventions in accordance with the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132) and its subsidiary legislation."

An initial investigation revealed that the batch of suspected counterfeit goods would have been exported to overseas regions.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action against counterfeit goods and smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who imports or exports any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

醫管局農曆新年假期家庭醫學及中醫門診服務安排,2026-02-13 17:35,2026-02-13 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300465.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（二月十三日）表示，公營醫療收費改革生效後，公立醫院的服務效率已顯著提升。其中醫管局轄下18間急症室，一月份合共有149 974名病人就診，較去年同期顯著減少近一成，當中次緊急及非緊急病人有74 404人，較去年同期大幅減少約18.3%。緊急類別病人平均等候時間亦由24分鐘縮短至20分鐘。

醫管局發言人說：「公營醫療收費改革各項措施已順利推行，為公立醫院提升服務效率帶來成效，醫管局亦已提前為農曆新年假期的服務安排做好準備，並將於明日開始啓動服務需求高峰期特別措施，確保在假期期間公立醫院為病人提供所需的服務，以及確保緊急的病人可接受即時治療。」

醫管局已加強家庭醫學門診服務，農曆新年假期期間（二月十七日至十九日）將有18間家庭醫學診所提供公眾假期家庭醫學門診服務（詳見下表一）。求診人士可透過電話預約系統、醫健通流動應用程式或HA Go流動應用程式內的「預約家庭醫學診所」功能，預約診症時間。

發言人提醒市民，近日天氣持續寒冷，預計流感及其他呼吸道病毒持續活躍。市民在假日期間應注意保暖，並注意個人及環境衞生，避免傳播疾病。市民如出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上口罩及盡快求醫。

發言人強調，非緊急的病患者應避免使用急症室，盡量向家庭醫學門診、私家醫生及私家醫院24小時門診求診，以減輕公立醫院急症室的壓力。醫務衞生局已整合全港18區將在農曆新年假期應診的私營醫療機構資料，當中包括13間私家醫院、最少34間私家診所，以及80間非牟利機構與私家中醫診所，市民可透過醫健通網頁及醫健通流動應用程式的「搜尋醫生」功能查閲相關醫療機構的資料（包括地址、電話及應診時段等）。

同時，發言人呼籲合資格人士及早接種流感及新冠疫苗，特別是高風險群組人士，減低自己和家人的感染機會，並降低感染後可能引致重症甚至死亡的風險。

另外，18區中醫診所暨教研中心（中醫診所）亦會於二月十八日至十九日特別加開政府資助中醫門診診症時段（詳見下表二），並於假期前後（二月十六日、二十日及二十一日）加強服務，以應對市民的求診需要。求診人士可於中醫診所的服務時間致電、使用醫健通流動應用程式或使用「18區中醫診所」流動應用程式（適用於曾登記使用18區中醫診所服務的求診人士）預約服務。

Hospital Authority announces service arrangements of family medicine and Chinese medicine clinics during Lunar New Year holidays,2026-02-13 17:35,2026-02-13 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300467.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson today (February 13) announced that the service efficiency of public hospitals has significantly improved since the implementation of the public healthcare fees and charges reform. Among the 18 Accident & Emergency Departments (A&Es) under the HA, there were 149 974 patient visits in January, showing a significant decrease of nearly 10 per cent compared to the same period last year. Of these, semi-urgent and non-urgent cases accounted for 74 404 visits, representing a substantial decrease of approximately 18.3 per cent compared to the same period last year. The average waiting time for emergency cases has also been reduced from 24 minutes to 20 minutes.

The HA spokesperson said, ""Although various measures of the public healthcare fees and charges reform have been implemented and have brought about enhancements in service efficiency at public hospitals, the HA has still made advance preparations for service arrangements during the Lunar New Year holiday period. Starting tomorrow, special measures for the service demand surge will be activated to ensure that public hospitals can provide necessary services to patients during the holiday period and that emergency patients can receive immediate treatment.""

The HA has enhanced the family medicine outpatient services. A total of 18 family medicine clinics (FMCs) will provide public holiday FMC services during the Lunar New Year holiday period (February 17 to 19) (see table 1 below). Patients may book an appointment either through the telephone appointment system, the eHealth mobile app or the ""Book FMC"" function of the HA Go mobile app.

The spokesperson reminded members of the public that the weather has been cold in recent days, and increased activity in influenza and some respiratory pathogens would continue to be observed. They should keep warm as well as stay vigilant about personal and environmental hygiene during the public holiday to avoid spreading diseases. Members of the public who develop respiratory symptoms should wear a mask and seek medical advice promptly.

The spokesperson emphasised that non-emergency patients should avoid using A&E services and seek treatment at FMCs, private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. The Health Bureau has collated information on private healthcare facilities, covering 13 private hospitals, more than 34 clinics, and 80 non-profit organisations and private Chinese medicine clinics, which will be in operation during the Lunar New Year holidays across 18 districts in the city. The information (including addresses, phone numbers and operation hours) of the relevant healthcare facilities can be accessed by members of the public via the eHealth website and the ""Doctor Search"" function of the eHealth mobile app.

Meanwhile, the spokesperson appealed to eligible members of the public, especially high-risk groups, to get vaccinated early for seasonal influenza and COVID-19 to reduce the chance of infection for themselves and their family members, as well as to reduce critical cases and deaths.

Moreover, Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres (CMCTRs) located in the 18 districts will arrange special sessions to provide government-subsidised Chinese medicine (CM) out-patient services on February 18 and 19 (see table 2 below). Meanwhile, the CM out-patient services will also be enhanced before and after the Lunar New Year holidays to meet public demand (February 16, 20 and 21). Patients may make an appointment either by telephone during service hours, through the eHealth mobile app or through the ""18 CM Clinics"" mobile app (applicable to patients who have registered for 18 CMCTRs service).

蚊傳疾病登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況,2026-02-13 17:30,2026-02-13 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300560.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月十三日）公布登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區（包括鄰近東南亞國家）的氣溫仍然適合蚊媒滋生，市民前往受蚊傳疾病影響的地區，應採取措施防止被蚊叮咬，包括穿着寬鬆、淺色的長袖上衣及長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。

登革熱
———

​由二月六日至昨日（二月十二日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案。個案涉及一名22歲女子，她居於菲律賓。初步調查顯示，她於二月三日與家人一同到訪香港旅遊，在二月四日出現發燒、頭痛、咳嗽和嘔吐，翌日到廣華醫院急症室求醫。她於二月六日出現氣促及胸口痛，並於二月七日再次到廣華醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入住深切治療部接受治療。她入院後情況一直危殆，臨床診斷為休克及多重器官衰竭，於二月八日離世。病人的血液樣本其後證實對登革熱病毒呈陽性反應。由於病人在整個潛伏期身處菲律賓，屬輸入個案。她有六名一同到訪香港的家人，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

登革熱病毒共有四種血清型。感染一種血清型並康復後，會對該血清型產生終生免疫力，但對其他血清型只有短暫的交叉免疫，因此仍有機會感染另一種血清型。若再次感染不同血清型，第二次感染有較高風險出現重症登革熱，包括出血及休克等嚴重併發症。由於登革熱在菲律賓屬風土病，且四種血清型病毒共同流行，中心不排除該名病人今次是二次感染另一種血清型病毒，從而導致嚴重併發症。中心會為病人的樣本進行進一步化驗。

截至昨日，今年錄得七宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。去年（二○二五年）錄得59宗登革熱個案，全部屬外地傳入。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞在二○二四年錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。去年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區亦呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南去年分別錄得超過120 000宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過50 000宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過4 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省去年共錄得超過3 500宗本地感染病例。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

基孔肯雅熱
—————

截至今日下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。​"
Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution opens for online applications from today,2026-02-13 17:15,2026-02-13 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300522.htm,"​The Department of Justice (DoJ)announced today (February 13) that the designated online platform for sports dispute resolution under the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution has been officially launched and is open for applications for mediation and arbitration of sports disputes starting from today.

The Pilot Scheme, as one of the initiatives under the Policy Address, will run for a period of two years. The Pilot Scheme aims to provide the sports sector with a fair, efficient and convenient mechanism for resolving sports disputes through mediation and arbitration. The DoJ officially launched the Pilot Scheme in December last year. Following an open invitation for joint proposals for the operation of the Pilot Scheme, the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre (AALCO-HKRAC) was selected to administer the Pilot Scheme, and the eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre to provide the technological infrastructure and online technical support required for the operation of the Pilot Scheme.

The Deputy Secretary for Justice and Chairperson of the Advisory Committee on Sports Dispute Resolution, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, said that establishing a mechanism that is efficient, credible and dedicated to resolving sports disputes is an important foundation for advancing the development of the sports industry and enhancing the corporate governance of the sports sector.

Dr Cheung also expressed delight that the panels of mediators and arbitrators have been established under the Pilot Scheme. These panels comprise 53 mediators and 43 arbitrators from the local legal and sports sectors and 23 jurisdictions, including experts in international sports mediation and arbitration. He stated that the diverse pool of international dispute resolution talent will help Hong Kong develop into a regional and international sports dispute resolution hub, reinforcing Hong Kong's position as a leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific region.

The DoJ will collaborate with AALCO-HKRAC and other stakeholders to organise a series of promotional and capacity-building activities to advance the development of sports mediation and arbitration in Hong Kong.

民政及青年事務局局長和勞工及福利局局長出席歲晚家訪活動後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-02-13 16:50,2026-02-13 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300464.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（二月十三日）陪同行政長官李家超出席歲晚家訪活動後會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長︰多謝大家，正如剛才行政長官所說，每年都有由行政長官帶領司局長到社區家訪的安排，我們希望透過探訪活動可以向市民送上祝福。今日由行政長官帶領我們，開始一連四日到全港十八區，與區議員、關愛隊一起去探訪街坊。

十八區的歲晚家訪活動由民政事務總署統籌，今年的主題是「駿馬迎新」，我們希望在馬年與市民一起攜手迎接新春，將滿滿的祝福和正能量傳達到社區。所以今年的家訪活動，除了一如以往會探望少數族裔家庭、長者家庭和基層家庭，我們也會探望一些年輕家庭、青年人和中產家庭，希望透過接觸不同階層的市民，了解他們的居住和生活情況，向大家送上祝福。

除了一系列的探訪活動，全港很多區亦有豐富慶祝活動，例如以往兩年都有舉辦的龍騰觀塘新春夜市，現時已經開始了，大家可以到訪觀塘這夜市。夜市活動會一直到年初六，即二月二十二日。夜市除了有街頭小吃，還有家鄉美食和綜合表演，大家可以和家人過年一起到龍騰觀塘新春夜市。除了觀塘，旁邊的黃大仙區由今日開始，一連三日亦會舉辦情人節新春市集，明日是情人節，年輕朋友可能很忙。市集會有節慶攤位、文化表演和互動工作坊，希望大家可以和情人或家人一起去感受情人節的甜蜜，讓社區和居民一起感受節日氣氛。

新春的時候，大家都希望可以在「新正頭」去祈福，所以大埔林村許願節也會繼續舉行，從大年初一到正月十五，市民可以拋寶牒和點蓮花燈祈福，為新一年送上新春的祝福。希望透過我們舉辦不同的活動，在未來的一年可以令市民有滿滿的正能量，馬年大家馬到功成，身體健康，家和萬事興，多謝大家。

勞工及福利局局長：大家好，剛才行政長官探望了長者，亦與長者們在長者社區服務中心內交流。大家都很關心長者，接下來我也想分享兩點。首先，大家尤其關心風險比較高的獨自居住或兩位共同居住的長者，這些我們視作風險比較高的長者群。我們現在開始運用大數據，並正陸陸續續推行至全港房委會（香港房屋委員會）的屋邨。下一步我們會再擴展，涵蓋包括如駿發花園這些由房協（香港房屋協會）管理的屋邨，亦會陸續推行。另外，我們會針對大家都關心的「三無大廈」，設法尋找住在「三無大廈」的高風險長者或殘疾人士，以及他們的照顧者，希望及早可以尋找到他們，並及早轉介讓他們獲得合適的支援。

另一方面，大家都希望我們想辦法用好科技賦能。政府計劃在下月向大家詳細介紹一個試驗計劃。我們計劃聯絡300戶的長者住戶及部分殘疾人士，為他們安裝智能意外偵測系統，尤其是大家關心的獨老或雙老住戶，萬一他們在家中跌倒，可以做到及早知道、及早發現，緊接可以及早介入並幫助他們，這些我們都會做。完成這個試驗計劃後，當通過大學為我們進行實證研究並獲得結論，便可給予一個很好的基礎，讓我們可以在香港大規模推行。多謝大家。

記者：想問麥局長接下來宏福苑居民的長期安置方案會何時公布？因為本來說在新年前會公布。另外亦想問孫局長，有見最低工資即將獲得通過，有勞方指該加幅未能追上通脹幅度，請問會否考慮再調整方程式，讓最低工資可追上該落差？

民政及青年事務局局長︰正如剛才行政長官所說，由財政司副司長領導的應急住宿安排工作組會在短期內公布長期的居住安排。在剛才行政長官探望宏福苑居民也好，或是我們平時與宏福苑居民接觸也好，我們都知道大家希望無論是甚麼方案，都可以快點落實，快點安排到他們的長期居住。財政司副司長與工作組也正在研究，正如剛才行政長官所說，會在短期內公布。

勞工及福利局局長：對最低工資而言，二○二六年是一個重要的年份。由二○一一年設立最低工資開始，到今年我們有一個重大的改變。第一，從今年起，我們會做「一年一檢」，即每一年均會調整最低工資，而調整的方法是採用三方都已經同意的方程式。方程式十分簡單，首先是保證最低工資必定涵蓋整體甲類消費物價通脹，第二個是「經濟增長」因素。大家可以看到我們今年的建議，前提當然要經過立法會通過，最低工資將增加$1，由$42.1調整至$43.1，增幅為2.38％，而今年的通脹是1.9％，因此今年的$1增幅，必定比通脹高。在方程式下，如該年面對通縮或者經濟增長不好，最低工資並不會減，只會維持不變。如有正增長，最低工資便會增加；若是負增長，便會凍結，不會減少。所以大家看到這個方案，是希望讓拿取最低工資的打工仔，可以獲得最少有通脹增幅的保障，而在一般的年份下，均可以分享到經濟增長的紅利。以今年而言，增幅是跑贏通脹的。

記者：接二連三有一些區議員違泊，你覺得這個情況是否理想？局方又會怎樣跟進呢？另外，也想問一下合安何時會召開業主大會？

民政及青年事務局局長：正如我們多次強調，特區政府對區議員的履職表現非常重視。區議員日常的言行舉止，應該要符合社會對區議員的期望。有報道指，有區議員出現一些違泊的問題，相關的區議會主席已經致函嚴正提醒有關區議員，必須確保他們的言行舉止能夠符合社會大眾對區議員的期望。我們亦會再三提醒全體區議員，希望大家都明白，市民對區議員的要求，都是希望大家履職盡責、謹言慎行。

至於合安（合安管理有限公司）管理方面，由上星期開始，經過發展局和民青局的協調，市建局（市區重建局）將他們的「樓宇更新大行動2.0」，即樓宇大維修津貼，透過支票直接發放給業主。合安作為經土地審裁處批准的管理人，它是代表法團管委會（法團管理委員會）。大家都知道，本來這津貼有一部分是由市建局給業主，另一部分是由市建局發放到法團的戶口。今次合安作為法團管委會身分，得到土地審裁處的批准，他們現在的工作就是將本來發放到法團戶口，在經過協調後，市建局會以支票形式發放給業主。在合安協助下，直至前日（二月十一日），已經向一千一百多名業主發放支票。另外，合安亦按《建築物管理條例》，作為一個法團管委會去履行責任，處理各方面的合約和法律條文，亦與前管理公司進行交接工作，同時要處理銀行的戶口結餘，還有一些銀行保證金等。有需要時，合安作為法團的管委會，會按照《建築物管理條例》所訂明的，作出重大決定時會召開業主大會，也會按照法例的要求和程序召開業主大會。

記者：一直都說想盡快公布，會不會怕居民失望，原本有消息說在新年前公布，怎樣看很多居民希望原址重建，是不是少數服從多數？如果有人願意等原址重建，又會不會讓他們等？剛才提到問卷方面有高比例同意業權收購，高比例即是幾多比例？

民政及青年事務局局長︰這正正就是剛才行政長官所說，由財政司副司長領導的工作組，我知道副司長及相關的局長亦密鑼緊鼓進行這方面的工作，而在我們接觸街坊時，都聽到街坊有不同的意見，例如有些人希望可以盡快換回一間居屋，有些人說可不可以快點用合理的價錢購買其居所，是有不同的意見。正如剛才行政長官所說，副司長領導的工作組研究這些問題時，會按照不同居民的意願，希望設計到不同的方案，讓居民可以選擇。當然每一個居民，每一個業主的考慮不一樣，有些希望可以盡快取現金，有些則希望可以盡快搬到單位，他們的訴求不一樣。正如行政長官剛才所說，工作組正密鑼緊鼓研究這方面的工作，亦會在短期內公布，謝謝。"

民政及青年事務局局長︰多謝大家，正如剛才行政長官所說，每年都有由行政長官帶領司局長到社區家訪的安排，我們希望透過探訪活動可以向市民送上祝福。今日由行政長官帶領我們，開始一連四日到全港十八區，與區議員、關愛隊一起去探訪街坊。

十八區的歲晚家訪活動由民政事務總署統籌，今年的主題是「駿馬迎新」，我們希望在馬年與市民一起攜手迎接新春，將滿滿的祝福和正能量傳達到社區。所以今年的家訪活動，除了一如以往會探望少數族裔家庭、長者家庭和基層家庭，我們也會探望一些年輕家庭、青年人和中產家庭，希望透過接觸不同階層的市民，了解他們的居住和生活情況，向大家送上祝福。

除了一系列的探訪活動，全港很多區亦有豐富慶祝活動，例如以往兩年都有舉辦的龍騰觀塘新春夜市，現時已經開始了，大家可以到訪觀塘這夜市。夜市活動會一直到年初六，即二月二十二日。夜市除了有街頭小吃，還有家鄉美食和綜合表演，大家可以和家人過年一起到龍騰觀塘新春夜市。除了觀塘，旁邊的黃大仙區由今日開始，一連三日亦會舉辦情人節新春市集，明日是情人節，年輕朋友可能很忙。市集會有節慶攤位、文化表演和互動工作坊，希望大家可以和情人或家人一起去感受情人節的甜蜜，讓社區和居民一起感受節日氣氛。

新春的時候，大家都希望可以在「新正頭」去祈福，所以大埔林村許願節也會繼續舉行，從大年初一到正月十五，市民可以拋寶牒和點蓮花燈祈福，為新一年送上新春的祝福。希望透過我們舉辦不同的活動，在未來的一年可以令市民有滿滿的正能量，馬年大家馬到功成，身體健康，家和萬事興，多謝大家。

勞工及福利局局長：大家好，剛才行政長官探望了長者，亦與長者們在長者社區服務中心內交流。大家都很關心長者，接下來我也想分享兩點。首先，大家尤其關心風險比較高的獨自居住或兩位共同居住的長者，這些我們視作風險比較高的長者群。我們現在開始運用大數據，並正陸陸續續推行至全港房委會（香港房屋委員會）的屋邨。下一步我們會再擴展，涵蓋包括如駿發花園這些由房協（香港房屋協會）管理的屋邨，亦會陸續推行。另外，我們會針對大家都關心的「三無大廈」，設法尋找住在「三無大廈」的高風險長者或殘疾人士，以及他們的照顧者，希望及早可以尋找到他們，並及早轉介讓他們獲得合適的支援。

另一方面，大家都希望我們想辦法用好科技賦能。政府計劃在下月向大家詳細介紹一個試驗計劃。我們計劃聯絡300戶的長者住戶及部分殘疾人士，為他們安裝智能意外偵測系統，尤其是大家關心的獨老或雙老住戶，萬一他們在家中跌倒，可以做到及早知道、及早發現，緊接可以及早介入並幫助他們，這些我們都會做。完成這個試驗計劃後，當通過大學為我們進行實證研究並獲得結論，便可給予一個很好的基礎，讓我們可以在香港大規模推行。多謝大家。

記者：想問麥局長接下來宏福苑居民的長期安置方案會何時公布？因為本來說在新年前會公布。另外亦想問孫局長，有見最低工資即將獲得通過，有勞方指該加幅未能追上通脹幅度，請問會否考慮再調整方程式，讓最低工資可追上該落差？

民政及青年事務局局長︰正如剛才行政長官所說，由財政司副司長領導的應急住宿安排工作組會在短期內公布長期的居住安排。在剛才行政長官探望宏福苑居民也好，或是我們平時與宏福苑居民接觸也好，我們都知道大家希望無論是甚麼方案，都可以快點落實，快點安排到他們的長期居住。財政司副司長與工作組也正在研究，正如剛才行政長官所說，會在短期內公布。

​行政長官到訪啟德及油麻地出席歲晚家訪活動後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附短片）,2026-02-13 16:38,2026-02-13 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300544.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（二月十三日）聯同民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡到訪啟德及油麻地出席歲晚家訪活動後會見傳媒的談話內容：

行政長官：大家好。很快就過年，所以我利用這個機會，來到社區，了解一下街坊的生活，特別是希望探望長者，了解他們在過年前有甚麼活動，還有送上我們的祝福。

今日我一早就到了啟德的「啟航1331」的「青年驛站」，這個「青年驛站」是利用了當時的檢疫隔離設施，開放給青年人交流的一個地方。我看過這地方的設施，有照應不同青年人的需要，包括有滑板場地，亦有匹克球運動場，平時亦會舉辦一些文化藝術和體育有關的活動，過往亦招待了一些從外國或內地來的青年人，跟本地青年人交往，我覺得這方面的交流很有意思。

之後，我亦利用這機會，探望在「青年驛站」居住、受宏福苑火災影響的居民，了解他們的生活環境。我跟兩個住戶聊天，環境都符合他們的要求，兩個家庭的成員都是七十多歲的長者。第一戶家庭是一對夫婦，他們居住在一個相連單位，符合他們的要求，包括有免費物資可以使用，亦有一些設施，包括共享廚房和共享客廳，他們覺得這些設施在日常生活中能幫助他們。而且在共用設施中，大家可以打成一片，有很多活動舉行，特別是安排了盆菜宴，過年前讓大家有守望相助、互相關懷的氣氛，出席人數很多。聽到在「啟航1331」的「青年驛站」的生活符合他們的要求，我感到安慰。另外，這些設施是讓他們自由使用，有自己的廚房，他們覺得在該處的日常生活滿意。其中一位太太很喜歡縫紉，有時會幫其他人改衫，聽到他們的生活，我感覺很安慰。

他們有跟我談及有關長遠住宿的想法，我亦說到政府一定要有方案令他們有選擇，各人的需求不同，他們亦告訴我他們本身的希望，我亦回應了，應急住宿安排工作組的組長在這方面已經大致收集了受影響家庭的意見，現正分析。我亦告訴他們，我要求了工作組在過年期間不可停頓工作，要馬不停蹄，盡量想出一個可以符合居民需求的處理方案。我亦向他們解釋，現時要歸納、克服三方面的問題和挑戰，包括希望想出可以一致性處理不同家庭需求的分歧，另外亦要看看如何可以處理好涉及公共保險方面所帶來的問題，包括業權和法律上可能引伸出來的爭拗，還有保險賠償的不確定性和複雜性，都希望能夠解決。而第三個，我們很擔心法律上的一些問題，如果處理不當、有爭拗，會導致需要處理法律訴訟方面的事宜，而延誤本來可以有個較快的方案處理受影響家庭的需要。我向所有受影響居民詢問後得出的第一個意見，均為希望盡快處理好，尤其我會見的兩個家庭成員都已年過七十，他們希望盡快解決，是最符合他們的需要。我亦告訴他們，我要求短期內盡快制定一個方案作落實及公布，讓大家選擇。

離開「青年驛站」後，我要求同事使用中九龍繞道，由啟德來到油麻地，交通暢順，整體來說，時間方面快了十至十五分鐘，是一個便利的交通安排。來到油麻地，我看到新開放的油麻地警署很受歡迎，聽取專員（油尖旺民政事務專員李家維）的匯報，這裏的確是一個很受歡迎的「打卡點」，途中遇見一些旅客，他們對於在油麻地有不同地方遊覽，均覺得吸引。

我亦探訪了兩戶在駿發花園居住的居民，兩戶居民都已上年紀，一戶是七十多歲，另一戶已過了九十歲。

首先，他們都很健康地生活，一對年紀超過七十歲的夫婦，兩位以前都是運動員，一位是跳水運動員，一位是足球運動員，他們都覺得在這個社區生活很符合他們的要求和需求，亦覺得可以隨時隨地有街坊一起活動，覺得這個社區可以給予他們一種很溫暖的感覺。

另外，有一位長者很喜歡唱戲曲，我亦看過他以前表演的一些記錄，他很開心，亦很健康。

來到這裏最主要是了解居家安老方面，最需要有好的配套，令他們平時日常生活可以想做甚麼就做甚麼，亦都有一群老友記朋友大家交流經驗，分享故事，都是健康生活的重要一部分。這方面我們看到後我覺得安慰。

當然，我亦與他們交流，他們是否滿意地區配套和服務？整體上，他們滿意，但我也說——沒有最好，只有更好。包括地區的區議會、區議員、關愛隊，民政事務處的同事等。他們大家很認識對方，這證明同事在這方面的努力有結果。但是，有甚麼新需求，我希望他們告訴我們。

我之後來到現場的一個社區長者服務中心，最令我激動的是見到他們很開心地走在一起，大家都認識對方，活動時很活躍，亦都很溫馨，所以我今次來到見到長者的生活，我亦感到欣慰。但始終我認為，特別是過年時候，如果大家可以更加了解對方，多送關懷，多送祝福等，會令大家覺得社區是一個更能帶給自己溫馨的地方。

在這方面，我與我的同事都會繼續努力工作，大家一齊唱唱歌、猜猜揮春等，氣氛很好。之後，我們送上心意祝福，送贈一些福袋給他們。

我來到的感覺是我們必須充分掌握社區的氣氛，所以地區工作是我施政中的一個重點，特別是長者，因為多年來長者是對於香港的發展，每一位都貢獻了力量，他們以前照顧我們，現在我們應該照顧他們。大家在交流中，互相支持，互相鼓勵，我們覺得很開心。

我的司局長會與我一樣會落區了解當區居民的生活，特別會向大家解釋自己領域的一些服務，讓大家更加知道。我們希望在過年前，每一位司局長會到地區表示我們對居民的關心，亦祝福大家過年時既溫馨愉快，以及有馬到功成的一個新的馬年。我亦利用這個機會多謝各位記者朋友多年的努力工作，亦祝福大家身體健康、工作順利。之後，麥局長和孫局長亦會說說我們的落區計劃和照顧長者方面的一些細節。祝大家工作順利、馬年進步。多謝大家。

記者：很多居民都說想原址重建，你有何看法？

行政長官：方案稍後會向大家公布。

記者：之前說過在新年前（公布）？

行政長官：剛才我說過有三方面的問題要克服，我已經要求黃偉綸副司長在過年期間不要停頓，盡量在短期內向大家公布。多謝大家。"

Grading of beach water quality released,2026-02-13 16:00,2026-02-13 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300339.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (February 13) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Five beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1) and one as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Golden Beach


Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Silverstrand Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach





Grade 2 beach is:



Lido Beach





  Compared with the grading released last week, Casam Beach has been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666.

2. The Government will gradually transfer the temporary storage facilities, temporary sewage treatment facilities and underground power cables on a site of approximately 4.2 hectares in the middle portion of the Loop, with a view to releasing the site from March 2027 to facilitate the construction of the planned railway station of the Northern Link Spur Line at the Loop and the nearby connecting roads.

To align with the principle of maximising the use of facilities constructed with the support of the Central Government, the Government will, consistent with previous practices, retain the facilities removed from both sites as far as practicable and deliver them to suitable locations for reconfiguration and reuse in a timely manner. This includes repurposing them as site offices and ancillary facilities, such as staff rest rooms, material storage rooms, and more, for government works projects.

In January 2024, the Government announced the release of an approximately 5-hectare community isolation facility site at the southern end of the Loop for the construction of the first batch of five buildings under Phase 1 of the Hong Kong Park. The construction of the buildings is under way. In addition, the Government announced in March 2025 the release of a 14-hectare community isolation facility site at the western end of the Loop. Relevant site formation works have been completed to align with the construction of the remaining batch of Phase 1 of the Hong Kong Park."
醫務衞生局局長在立法會衞生事務委員會會議就香港醫務委員會改革的立法修訂建議及相關措施的開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-13 14:49,2026-02-13 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300438.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（二月十三日）在立法會衞生事務委員會會議就香港醫務委員會（醫委會）改革的立法修訂建議及相關措施的開場發言：

主席、各位議員：

香港醫務委員會是根據《醫生註冊條例》成立的一個獨立法定機構，其職能有很多方面，包括醫學課程評審、實習醫生培訓評審、醫生註冊──這包括一般醫生註冊、專科醫生註冊，以至非本地培訓醫生的有限度註冊及特別註冊等，他們亦負責制定醫學守則及指引、監辦非本地培訓醫生的執業資格試等，目標是維持醫生的專業水平。醫務委員會（香港醫務委員會）亦會按法例賦予的獨立準司法職能的權力以至責任，處理就醫生專業操守或水平的一些申訴，通過研訊決定是否作出紀律處分。

香港一直擁有高水平的醫療服務及高效率的醫療系統，醫務委員會的職能其實在這方面是很重要的一環。醫患關係是建基於信任，香港的醫護專業奉行專業自主自律的原則，亦是建基於社會大眾對醫護專業的信任。

就近期一宗引起公眾高度關注的醫委會研訊小組裁決，醫委會已經應醫衞局的要求，於去年十二月提交了報告，檢討他們處理申訴及紀律研訊的機制，並且提出了改善建議，而申訴專員亦已經於本月五日公布名為衞生署轄下香港醫務委員會秘書處就投訴處理所提供的支援及成效、衞生署的相關監管的主動調查行動報告。為確保醫療專業水平精益求精、保障市民的健康，以及鞏固病人和醫生之間的互信，政府決定提出修訂《醫生註冊條例》，從而改革醫委會的制度。同時，我們會就支持醫委會履行職責的行政支援作出一些相應的措施。

我們由今年一月開始已經開展了一系列的諮詢，與專業團體和病人組織等持份者會面，聆聽他們的意見。較早前我亦與醫委會委員就此議題交流意見。

我們建議循以下兩大方向修訂《條例》，推動醫委會改革，支持醫委會在專業自主自律的原則下更有效履行職責︰

（一）改革醫委會組成；及

（二）優化投訴處理機制和流程

立法建議方向

改革醫委會組成

在改革醫委會組成方面，現時醫委會有32名委員，包括24名醫生委員（75%）及八名業外委員（25%）。不過，就處理涉及醫生的申訴及紀律研訊方面，其實除了醫委會的成員之外，尚有84名由不同機構或組織，例如大律師公會（香港大律師公會）、香港律師會、香港會計師公會、香港社會服務聯會和病人組織等提名出來的獨立審裁員。這84名獨立審裁員中，有48名是醫生，有36名是業外人士，包括剛才提及的一些專業人士，如律師、會計師等。這些獨立審裁員會加入初步偵訊委員會（偵委會）或研訊小組，輪值參與申訴處理的不同程序。所以，我們建議循以下方向去優化醫委會組成：

（一）引入更多不同資歷背景及入會途徑的醫生委員，用以反映業界廣泛意見，令醫生委員組成更均勻，不會太過單一，包括研究由政府直接委任非官方醫生成員等；

（二）加入更多業外委員，特別是考慮到現代醫療服務更重視跨專業團隊協作，我們建議加入更多其他醫療專業人員作為業外委員；

（三）加入基層醫療的代表，反映基層醫療發展的需要和方向；以及

（四）加入正在籌辦的第三間醫學院的代表。

優化投訴處理機制

至於在優化投訴處理機制方面，醫委會由二○二四年年底已經推行一些行政改善措施，加強申訴處理的機制，如盤點待研訊個案、加強協調法律代表和專家證人、完善資訊系統，以及加強秘書處對個案進度的監管等。

我們建議考慮修例，進一步優化申訴處理機制，措施包括︰

（一）要求醫委會就申訴處理機制不同部分訂立一些目標時間；

（二）設立制度監察整體個案處理進度，提高透明度及可預期性；

（三）確立初步偵訊委員會及研訊小組決定和運作的獨立性，並且加強獨立審裁員在偵委會及研訊小組的參與；

（四）調整偵委會成員的數目，與研訊小組一致，並增加偵委會的數目；

（五）現行偵委會主席和副主席負責處理駁回一些瑣屑無聊的申訴，我們建議確保業外人士參與以優化程序及加強公信力；

（六）在《條例》列明醫委會督導秘書處工作的責任，並且要求秘書處就工作向醫委會負責；

（七）容許投訴人和被投訴醫生均可就研訊小組裁決向醫委會或向法庭申請覆核或上訴；

（八）在處理涉及已經被法庭定罪的醫生的紀律研訊時，訂明研訊小組應該採納定罪時法庭就事實作出的裁決；以及

（九）如醫生被裁定干犯嚴重罪行而且被判處監禁一定年期，需要即時從醫生名冊除名；重新註冊的申請將視乎罪行的性質及嚴重性，按紀律程序及機制處理。

除了以上修訂條例，以改革醫委會處理申訴及紀律研訊機制，我們亦建議把握這個機會修訂條例，提升整體醫生水平及人力資源。包括：

（一） 強制性延續醫學教育

現時持續專業發展已經被訂為所有護士、牙醫和專職醫療人員續領執業證明書的先決條件。

不過，在醫生方面，《條例》現時只要求專科醫生接受他們的延續醫學教育。我們故此會修例，把延續醫學教育的要求擴展至非專科醫生，換句話說，所有註冊醫生都要接受延續教育，並將此規定訂明為續領執業證明書的先決條件，以確保他們的專業能力。

（二）進一步擴闊特別註冊途徑

另一方面，我們會進一步擴闊特別註冊途徑。在現行《條例》下，特別註冊途徑對非香港永久性居民設有較多限制。海外招聘經驗顯示，相關安排減低了對非本地培訓醫生的吸引力。因此，我們建議容許非香港永久性居民與香港永久性居民一樣，可以循特別註冊途徑申請來香港執業，從而擴闊人才來源。不過，醫管局（醫院管理局）仍然會繼續執行優先聘請本地醫科畢業生的政策，上述修訂不會影響本地畢業生就業及接受專科培訓的機會。

行政配套措施

除了修訂條例，政府會以行政配套措施加強衞生署對醫委會秘書處提供的支援，特別是提升處理關於醫生專業操守申訴的整體能力。政府加強行政配套措施是應醫委會的建議以支持醫委會的工作，並不會取代或干預醫委會履行其《條例》下的職能。

原則上，我們會從幾方面着力：

（一）加強衞生署署長作為醫委會官方委員的角色，適度反映政府政策方面的意見，作為醫委會與政府溝通協作的橋樑，並輔助醫委會督導秘書處的工作；

（二）支持醫委會探討由具專業背景的高級管理人員出任醫委會秘書處主管，以加強秘書處行政管治；

（三）積極探討成立專責隊伍支援申訴調查，由具相關專業背景的人員專責就接獲的申訴進行調查，以及增加法律支援人員和行政人員；

（四）政府亦已邀請香港醫學專科學院研究建立一個人才庫，有系統地組織不同醫學專科的專家定時按照醫委會的邀請，作為專家證人就申訴個案提供意見及參與研訊；

（五）為有需要的醫委會委員和審裁員提供適當培訓及支援，確保他們充分了解醫委會的法定職能，並且盡責履職。

結語

政府相信改革措施能夠在維持專業自主自律與程序公義的前提下，進一步提升投訴處理的效率與透明度，從而加強公眾信心，並配合香港醫療政策發展的需要，持續提升醫療專業水平與服務質素。

我們會繼續保持與持份者的溝通，爭取於今年上半年準備好修訂草案，盡早提交予立法會審議。多謝主席。"

DH continues to step up enforcement actions against illegal use of pharmacy logo and title with approach of Chinese New Year holidays,2026-02-13 12:30,2026-02-13 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300332.htm,"With the Chinese New Year holidays approaching, the Department of Health (DH) today (February 13) announced that it will continue to step up inspections of Authorized Sellers of Poisons (ASPs), commonly known as pharmacies, and Listed Sellers of Poisons, commonly known as medicine companies, throughout Hong Kong, particularly in tourist areas, to monitor their compliance with the laws and the relevant codes of practice. Last year (2025), approximately 9 600 inspections of these premises were conducted to combat illegal practices. The DH will continue to enhance enforcement actions against the illegal use of logos and titles of pharmacies and carry out follow-up investigations of suspected violations.These efforts aim to safeguard public health. The DH also reminded the public, including tourists, to verify the pharmacy logo (see Annex 1) in the prescribed form when purchasing medicines.

Stepping up inspections and enforcement
---------------------------

Last year, seven limited companies and a proprietor of a retailer, all of which were not pharmacies, were convicted of displaying a logo resembling the prescribed form of a pharmacy at their premises and were fined from $3,500 to $10,000. Two other limited companies, which were also not pharmacies, committed the same offence and were convicted and fined $5,000 and $32,000 respectively in January this year.

According to the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), only persons authorised by the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong as ASPs are allowed to conduct the relevant retail business of selling poisons at premises registered by the Board, including poisons listed in Part 1 and Part 2 of the Poisons List at Schedule 10 to the Pharmacy and Poisons Regulations (Cap. 138A). Displaying a logo in the prescribed form of a pharmacy or a logo, which resembles the logo in the prescribed form at premises other than the registered premises of a pharmacy, or using the Chinese term ""藥房"" or the terms such as ""pharmacy"", ""dispensary"", or ""drug-store"" in connection with any business engaged in the retail sale of poisons, commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment.

The use of a pharmacy logo or its title as stipulated by the Ordinance is applicable to all retailers, including those that are not licensed by the Board. The DH reminded non-pharmacy businesses to refrain from illegitimate use and will continue to collect intelligence through different channels. If any retailer is suspected of illegally displaying a pharmacy logo in the prescribed form or pharmacy title, the DH will follow up and carry out an investigation immediately and conduct joint operations with relevant departments when necessary.

Label for ASPs and ""Licence Scanner""
------------------------------------------ 

To enable the public to identify registered pharmacies, the DH has formulated a label (see Annex 2) for identification of ASPs, and the labels have been sent to each pharmacy for display in a conspicuous position in the pharmacy.​Members of the public and tourists can download the eHealth app from the website (app.ehealth.gov.hk) and use the ""Licence Scanner"" on its homepage to scan the QR code displayed at the pharmacy. For registered pharmacies, the message ""This is a QR Code issued for licensed pharmacy"" will appear alongside details of that particular registered pharmacy. Members of the public can also visit thewebsiteof the DH's Drug Office for educational materials on ""'Pharmacies' in Hong Kong"", as well as the names and addresses of all licensees including ASPs.

In addition, to help Mainland visitors distinguish pharmacies in Hong Kong, the DH also detailed points to note when buying medicines from pharmacies in Hong Kong on its official WeChat account (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/108354.html)."
醫務衞生局局長在立法會衞生事務委員會會議就中醫藥發展的開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-13 12:18,2026-02-13 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300343.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（二月十三日）在立法會衞生事務委員會會議就中醫藥發展的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

今日第一個題目是先向新一屆衞生事務委員會委員匯報中醫藥發展相關政策措施及最新進展。

香港中醫藥發展已進入新里程，多項中醫藥重點旗艦項目及政策措施相繼落實。去年十二月，政府公布《中醫藥發展藍圖》（《藍圖》），是政府首份針對香港中醫藥發展的政策文件，勾劃香港中醫藥發展願景，涵蓋中醫服務、中醫專業、中藥發展、傳承文化及走向世界五個領域，提出八個目標及20個行動。這份《藍圖》有三大理念。

第一，善用中醫藥優勢強化本地醫療服務，擴闊中醫藥基層、第二層及第三層醫療服務的發展，同時透過公眾教育讓市民懂得適時選用中醫藥服務。第二，是配合國家中醫藥發展大局，將中醫藥深度融入醫療系統，透過科研創新推動中醫藥的新質生產力發展。第三，把握香港醫療體制、規管制度、標準制訂等方面的優勢，在「一國兩制」的優勢下，讓香港成為助力國家推動中醫藥走向世界的橋頭堡。《藍圖》為香港中醫藥發展訂立明確方向，醫務衞生局會積極跟進落實《藍圖》提出的所有行動。

與此同時，香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓兩個本地中醫藥發展旗艦機構亦已於去年十二月十一日分階段投入服務。

中醫醫院是香港首間以中醫服務為主的醫院，在開院首年，醫院會提供門診及日間住院服務，全面開展中醫六大分科及12個專項（專病項目），並於今年十二月開始提供住院服務。自從中醫醫院開放預約服務以來，市民反應非常踴躍，政府資助門診服務持續滿額並已三度增加名額，更有來自海外多個國家的患者慕名前來求醫。今年四月起，我們將有更多本地及內地知名的中醫藥專家加入中醫醫院臨床團隊，參與醫教研工作。配合《藍圖》提出的政策方向，中醫醫院會以進一步建立純中醫、中醫為主及中西醫協作臨床服務的「香港模式」為目標，推動中醫藥在本地、粵港澳大灣區，以至國際層面的發展。

至於政府中藥檢測中心，永久大樓落成啓用後，將透過引進高端科技器材及人才，提升中藥檢測方法、強化中藥標準開發能力及加強本港與海內外的合作交流，將香港發展成為中藥檢測和質量控制的國際中心。中醫醫院和檢測中心在投入服務兩個月已合共舉辦超過130場的業界及公眾導賞活動，在中醫藥推廣方面擔當重要的角色。

《藍圖》提及鼓勵跨專業協作，隨着《專職醫療業條例》的相關修訂在去年獲立法會通過，專職醫療業人員，包括物理治療師、職業治療師、放射技師和醫務化驗師，已可接受註冊中醫師轉介病人。香港中醫藥管理委員會和專職醫療業管理局已隨即展開討論，相繼修訂專業守則及公布醫療轉介指引。轉介安排在臨床層面促進了跨專業協作，在醫療系統層面更是深化了中醫藥的角色。

在上述成果的基礎上，政府會加大力度推動香港中醫藥高質量、高水平及全方位發展，投放更多資源及落實政策措施，實現《藍圖》提出的願景——傳承中醫藥智慧，背靠國家發展經驗和資源，利用中醫藥讓香港市民享受更優質、全面的醫療服務，提升健康水平，同時建設香港成為中醫及中藥走向世界的橋頭堡。

對中醫藥服務、中醫專業、中藥發展及中醫藥規管等其他範疇的進一步細節，已載於相關文件之中，供各位委員參考。我和同事樂意回應委員的提問及意見。

多謝主席。"
署理政制及內地事務局局長在立法會政制事務委員會就有關推進粵港澳大灣區建設及與內地區域合作的政策措施開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-13 11:08,2026-02-13 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300287.htm,"以下是署理政制及內地事務局局長胡健民今日（二月十三日）在立法會政制事務委員會就有關推進粵港澳大灣區建設及與內地區域合作的政策措施的開場發言：

主席、各位議員：

今日很高興出席政制事務委員會會議向各位議員介紹政制及內地事務局有關推進粵港澳大灣區建設及與內地區域合作的政策措施。

中共二十屆四中全會審議通過《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》，對「十五五」時期國家經濟社會發展作出頂層設計及戰略擘畫。「十五五」規劃建議亦為香港的發展作出了重要部署，提出鞏固提升和建設打造「四中心、一高地」，即國際金融、航運、貿易和創新科技中心，以及國際高端人才集聚高地。這些部署既是香港未來長遠發展的方向和動能所在，同時亦切合國家的發展定位和有利國家的發展需要。特區政府會積極主動對接國家「十五五」規劃，深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設，更好融入和服務國家發展大局，推動香港實現更好發展。

粵港澳大灣區建設是國家主席習近平親自謀劃、親自部署、親自推動的重大國家戰略。我們會錨定習主席提出的「一點兩地」新定位，協同粵澳齊心協力將大灣區建設為國家新發展格局的戰略支點、高質量發展的示範地、中國式現代化的引領地。

在國家的大力支持下，香港特區與其他大灣區城市一直密切協作，不斷促進灣區城市間的高水平互聯互通和市場一體化建設。特區政府會繼續主動作為，積極與中央相關部委、廣東省政府及澳門特區政府保持緊密聯繫，久久為功，不斷深化粵港澳三地的規則銜接和機制對接，促進人流、物流、資金流、信息流等重要生產要素在區內高效流動，爭取更多惠港利民、促進灣區融合發展的政策突破，鞏固提升大灣區高質量發展動力源作用，助力國家進一步深化改革和高水平對外開放。

特區政府亦會充分發揮香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，鞏固提升香港國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位和「出海」平台的功能角色。我們亦會說好灣區故事，向本港、內地及海外各界宣傳推廣大灣區建設的重大機遇，擔當好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色，充分發揮香港「引進來、走出去」的雙向平台作用。此外，我們亦會透過外訪、傳統媒體、線上方式如大灣區專題網站、灣區辦通訊、實體活動如研討會、展覽會等多元方式，向本地、內地及海外宣傳推廣大灣區建設的龐大機遇。

在與內地區域合作方面，香港特區與內地各省市自治區在不同層面都開展了密切的合作，無論是全方位、多領域、深層次的合作機制，或就個別領域推展的合作項目，均朝着推進相互發展，為香港尋求更寬廣的發展空間，以更好服務國家所需的方向邁進。

在合作機制方面，現屆政府一直積極跟進和加強在合作機制下與各省市的合作，並先後成立了渝港合作會議機制和浙港合作會議機制。現時香港已經與北京、上海、廣東（包括深圳）、浙江、福建、湖北、重慶以及四川設立了合作機制。除了召開渝港合作和浙港合作的首次會議外，我們亦在香港召開了閩港合作會議、京港合作會議及滬港合作會議。這些會議均得到相關的省市領導親自出席，共同主持。

而香港特區與內地其他省市自治區的合作項目同樣是既深且廣，不遑多讓，合作範疇涵蓋金融、物流、經貿、創科、法律、教育、青年發展及旅遊等各方面。

我們會竭力在現有合作機制下推展更多項目。同時，我們會不斷深化與內地其他省市的合作，研究與具發展潛力和合作空間的省市開拓更多合作平台，並繼續以務實及「成熟一項推一項」的方式，加強與各省市緊密協作，達致優勢互補、互利共贏，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

主席，我的介紹完畢。我和新上任的林雅雯專員（粵港澳大灣區發展專員）和同事樂意聽取議員的意見、建議和解答議員的問題。多謝主席。"

The case involved an unauthorised structure of about 77 square metres on the flat roof of a composite building on Hong Keung Street, Wong Tai Sin. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (February 13), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

多倫多經貿辦處長王國彪在酒會上致歡迎辭時表示，香港於二○二五年取得令人鼓舞的成果，在經濟發展上持續展現動力。

他表示，「一國兩制」繼續是香港繁榮穩定的基石，穩健法治和普通法制度廣獲國際認同。過去一年，國際資金持續流入，多國企業在港擴展業務，二○二五年恒生指數錄得約三成升幅，香港在首次公開招股集資額領先全球，資產及財富管理業務和銀行存款亦持續增長，充分反映國際社會對香港營商環境的信心。

王國彪表示，展望馬年，香港將繼續發揮自身優勢，把握新機遇，並深化與加拿大各界別的交流合作，進一步鞏固其作為全球商業及文化樞紐的地位。

他說：「金融及創科將是香港兩大增長引擎。金融方面，香港正進一步發揮『超級聯繫人』的角色，協助內地企業走向全球，同時積極拓展與中東、東南亞及中亞等市場的合作。」

創科方面，香港正集中發展人工智能、生物科技、金融科技，以及新能源與新材料等具競爭優勢的領域。他指出，北部都會區將成為推動創科發展的關鍵平台。他說：「香港特別行政區政府正加快該區建設，包括放寬規劃限制，採用更具彈性的發展模式，從而實現土地綁定產業的融合發展。」

Guests from the business, cultural, academic and community sectors gathered to exchange views and learn about Hong Kong's latest developments on the economic and cultural fronts.

  In his welcoming remarks, the Director of the Toronto ETO, Mr Bill Wong, said that Hong Kong achieved a series of encouraging results in 2025, reflecting the city's continued momentum in economic development.

  He said that the ""one country, two systems"" principle continues to be the cornerstone of Hong Kong's prosperity, with the robust rule of law and common law system internationally recognised. Over the past year, international confidence has been reflected in sustained capital inflows, expansion by multinational companies, a roughly 30 per cent rise in the Hang Seng Index in 2025, leading the world in initial public offering fundraising, and continued growth in asset and wealth management as well as bank deposits.

  Looking ahead to the Year of the Horse, Mr Wong said that Hong Kong will continue to build on its strengths, seize new opportunities, and deepen engagement with various sectors in Canada, reinforcing its role as a global business and cultural hub.

  ""Finance and innovation and technology (I&T) are two major engines driving Hong Kong's growth. In finance, Hong Kong is further strengthening its role as a 'super connector' - helping Mainland enterprises go global while actively fostering closer ties with markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Central Asia,"" he said.

   In I&T, Hong Kong is focusing on AI, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials, which are areas where it has a competitive edge. He said that the Northern Metropolis will serve as a key platform for driving I&T development. ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is accelerating development in the area, including easing planning restrictions and adopting more flexible development models with a view to driving deep integration of land use and industry development.""

  At the reception, Senior Manager of Marketing and Public Relations of the HKTB Mr Jorge Lee shared with participants the upcoming events and festivals in Hong Kong, positioning Hong Kong as the events capital in Asia.

  To add a cultural dimension to the celebration, the Toronto ETO invited a Hong Kong a cappella group, Brio Singers, to present a series of Hong Kong-themed songs, showcasing the creativity and dynamism of Hong Kong's performing arts scene.

  The Toronto ETO and the HKTB will jointly host another spring reception in Vancouver on February 18."
CFS reminds public not to illegally import regulated food as Chinese New Year approaches (with photos),2026-02-13 10:00,2026-02-13 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300207.htm,"​With the Chinese New Year approaching, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (February 13) reminded members of the public not to illegally bring regulated food, such as raw meat, poultry and eggs, from the Mainland or overseas into Hong Kong.

According to the Imported Game, Meat, Poultry and Eggs Regulations (Cap. 132AK), each consignment of imported game, meat, poultry and eggs, whether for personal use or not, must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the issuing entity of the place of origin or written permission from the FEHD. Regulated food entering Hong Kong from the Mainland must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by Mainland Customs to prove that the food is from registered processing plants for supplying to Hong Kong recognised by the Mainland regulatory authority. Any offender shall be liable on conviction to a fine of $50,000 and to imprisonment for six months.

CFS officers will distribute leaflets at different boundary control points before and during the holiday to remind inbound travellers and the public to abide by the relevant regulations.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""Members of the public who illegally bring regulated food into Hong Kong will not only be prosecuted, but also need to be aware that these foods may be improperly stored during travel, such as at an improper temperature or unhygienic packaging, leading to the growth of pathogenic bacteria and increased food safety and personal health risks."" To avoid criminal liability and health risks, the CFS urged members of the public not to import regulated food illegally without a recognised health certificate, written permission from the FEHD or an import licence for the sake of convenience.

The spokesman said that meat and egg products not fully cooked and raw meat products in any forms of packaging (including vacuum packed or tinfoil) are all subject to the control of relevant regulations.

The CFS has been striving to safeguard food safety in Hong Kong, and will continue to step up enforcement, publicity and education work with the relevant departments at various boundary control points."
Interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements releases latest information and appeals to public and visitors to plan cross-boundary trips early during Chinese New Year Golden Week of Mainland,2026-02-13 10:00,2026-02-13 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021200671.htm,"  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following latest information today (February 13) on the traffic and public transport arrangements during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland (February 15 to 23):

  During the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, in anticipation of a large number of members of the public, visitors and cross-boundary vehicles visiting land-based boundary control points (BCPs), the Transport Department (TD) appealed to cross-boundary travellers to use public transport services travelling between Hong Kong and the Mainland or Macao, plan their trips early and allow sufficient travelling time.

Enhancing services for travel convenience

  The TD has been steering local and cross-boundary public transport operators (PTOs) to strengthen their services during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland to accommodate the diverse travelling needs of passengers, including:


The MTR Corporation Limited will enhance the train services of the East Rail Line (ERL) between Admiralty and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau Stations at different times during the above period. Most local railway lines will operate overnight on February 16 (Monday, Lunar New Year's Eve), excluding cross-boundary journeys on the ERL between Sheung Shui and Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau Stations, the Airport Express and the Disneyland Resort Line. Services on the relevant railway lines will be strengthened after the Night Parade on February 17 (Lunar New Year's Day) and the Fireworks Display on February 18 (second day of Lunar New Year) for the convenience of residents and visitors;
Increasing the frequency of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) shuttle bus (Gold Bus) to an average of about one minute during peak hours, if needed;
Increasing the frequency of the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to an average of about two minutes during peak hours, if needed;
Increasing the quota of cross-boundary coaches to strengthen services;
The frequency of local franchised bus B routes connecting various land-based BCPs will also be increased to a level higher than that of normal weekends, and the operators concerned will reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet passenger demand; and
In the early hours from February 17 (Tuesday, Lunar New Year's Day) to February 19 (Thursday, third day of Lunar New Year), after the service hours of the ERL trains to Lo Wu Station, a special bus service on KMB Route No. N73 (MTR Sheung Shui Station to San Tin) will be provided to carry passengers to interchange to the Yellow Bus for their journey to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port, which operates round the clock.


Travel during non-peak hours

  It is anticipated that the waiting time for public transport services, including the Gold Bus and the franchised bus B routes, may be longer. Passengers are advised to travel during non-peak hours, maintain order while queuing and heed advice from on-site police and staff of PTOs concerned. Passengers planning to take cross-boundary coaches are also advised to reserve their coach tickets in advance.

  Of note, motorists of cross-boundary private cars crossing the border are advised that, subject to actual traffic conditions, special traffic arrangements may be implemented at the Lok Ma Chau and the Shenzhen Bay Ports during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland to secure smooth access for public transport vehicles to the above BCPs. Cross-boundary private cars may experience longer waiting times for crossing the BCPs during peak periods. Motorists should pay extra attention to variable message signs and traffic signs along the roads. In case of traffic congestion, they should remain patient and follow the instructions of on-site police.

Information dissemination

  For the HZMB, to plan their journeys ahead, members of the public can make use of the TD's HKeMobility mobile app or website (hkemobility.gov.hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access snapshots of traffic conditions at inbound and outbound vehicle plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They can also check real-time situations of the vehicle clearance plaza of the Zhuhai Port through the WeChat official accounts ""hzmbzhport"" or ""zhuhaifabu"" (traffic-info.gzazhka.com:5015/#/) (Chinese only). Moreover, motorists are reminded to always comply with the traffic control measures implemented by the Zhuhai authority when driving on the HZMB Main Bridge. Vehicles must not occupy the emergency lane unless instructed by the Zhuhai authority.

  The public and visitors may visit the one-stop information platform on immigration clearance ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound) of the Security Bureau or HKeMobility for the latest information on various land-based BCPs more conveniently. The TD will provide information on the services and waiting times of the Gold Bus, the Yellow Bus and the MTR. Members of the public are advised to check the latest traffic news through radio and television broadcasts, the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk) and HKeMobility.

  The TD's Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre operates round the clock to closely monitor the traffic conditions and public transport services of various districts, the BCPs and major stations, and to implement contingency measures when necessary to meet service demands.

  The interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements is tasked with holistically co-ordinating and steering the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, as well as strengthening information dissemination to enable the public and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation."
One more resident who was injured in Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire has been discharged upon recovery ,2026-02-13 10:00,2026-02-13 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021200544.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced today (February 13) that one more resident who was injured in the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire has been discharged from hospital upon recovery. Out of the 79 injured persons, 78 have been discharged upon recovery, and the remaining patient is in stable condition. Healthcare staff will continue to provide appropriate treatment and care to the patient.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""I am very pleased that one more resident injured in the fire has been discharged from hospital before the Chinese New Year. I would also like to express my gratitude to the healthcare staff of the Hospital Authority (HA) for their wholehearted and dedicated efforts in treating the injured. Whiletreatment and care of burn patients may involve many challenges and uncertainties, our HA colleagues have helped the 79 injured persons to make steady progress towards recovery through their professionalism and extensive experience.

  ""Moreover, healthcare personnel from both the public and private sectors have worked with concerted efforts to save lives and provide comprehensive care for the physical and mental well-being of the affected residents under the co-ordination of the HHB. Colleagues from the HHB, the HA and the Department of Health will continue to shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding the well-being of citizens.""

  At present, the HHB leverages the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The latest figures of these services are as follows:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1, 2025, (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow up appointments and medication refill service points, from Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts.

內地春節黃金周期間，運輸署預計會有大量市民、訪港旅客及跨境車輛使用各陸路口岸，呼籲跨境出行人士盡量使用公共交通工具往來香港和內地或澳門，及早計劃行程，預留充裕交通時間。

加強服務便利出行

署方已督導本地及跨境公共運輸服務營辦商，在內地春節黃金周期間加強服務應對乘客的不同出行需要，包括：


香港鐵路有限公司在上述期間的不同時段，會加強東鐵綫來往金鐘至羅湖／落馬洲站的列車服務；而大部分本地鐵路線會於二月十六日（星期一，年廿九）提供通宵服務（不包括東鐵綫來往上水至羅湖及落馬洲站的跨境車程、機場快綫及迪士尼綫），並因應二月十七日（年初一）的花車巡遊及二月十八日（年初二）的煙花匯演加強相關鐵路線的服務，以方便本地市民和旅客出行；
增加港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）的班次，有需要時可達最高峰平均約一分鐘一班；
增加落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的班次，有需要時可達最高峰平均約兩分鐘一班；
增發跨境直通巴士配額以加強服務；
連接各陸路口岸的本地專營巴士B線的班次亦會提升至高於一般周末的水平，相關營辦商會預留車輛及人手應對乘客需求；及
在二月十七日（星期二，年初一）至二月十九日（星期四，年初三）凌晨，加設九巴第N73號特別巴士服務（港鐵上水站往新田），在東鐵綫前往羅湖站的服務結束後，接載乘客轉乘皇巴，經24小時通關的落馬洲／皇崗口岸前往內地。


考慮非繁忙時間出行

運輸署預計，公共運輸服務包括金巴及專營巴士B線的等候時間或會較長，乘客應考慮於非繁忙時間出行，在候車期間遵守秩序，並遵從現場警務人員及相關營辦商職員的指示。計劃乘坐跨境巴士的人士亦應提早預訂車票。

駕駛跨境私家車出入境人士請注意，視乎現場交通情況，落馬洲及深圳灣口岸在內地春節黃金周期間或會實施特別交通安排，以便保障公共運輸車輛暢順地進入上述口岸，跨境私家車在車流高峰期或需較長的等候時間輪候通過口岸。駕駛人士請特別留意沿途可變信息顯示屏及交通標誌。如遇交通受阻，請保持忍讓及遵從現場警務人員的指示。

資訊發布

至於港珠澳大橋，市民可透過運輸署流動應用程式「香港出行易」或網頁（hkemobility.gov.hk/tc/traffic-information/live/cctv），查閱大橋香港口岸出境及入境客車通關廣場的交通快拍，亦可透過「港珠澳大橋珠海口岸」或「珠海發布」微信公眾號內的「大橋口岸實時通關」服務（traffic-info.gzazhka.com:5015/#/），查閱大橋珠海口岸的車輛實時通關情況，以便及早計劃行程。此外，運輸署提醒駕駛人士於大橋主橋行駛時，應時刻遵照珠海當局實施的交通管控措施，除非獲珠海市當局指示，否則車輛一律不可佔用應急車道。

市民和旅客亦可透過保安局的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound）或「香港出行易」，更便捷地取得各陸路口岸的最新資訊。當中，運輸署會提供金巴、皇巴及港鐵服務情況及輪候時間。市民請留意電台、電視台、運輸署網頁（www.td.gov.hk）及「香港出行易」發放的最新交通消息。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心24小時運作，密切監察全港各區、口岸和主要車站的交通情況和公共運輸服務，適時採取措施，應對服務需求。

節慶安排跨部門工作小組負責全面統籌並督導各政府部門有關內地春節黃金周期間接待訪港旅客的預備工作，以及加強資訊發布，方便市民及旅客按最新情況規劃行程。"
農曆新年將至　食安中心提醒市民切勿非法進口受規管食物（附圖）,2026-02-13 10:00,2026-02-13 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/13/P2026021300206.htm,"農曆新年將至，食物環境衞生署（食環署）食物安全中心（食安中心）今日（二月十三日）提醒市民由內地或海外返港時，切勿非法攜帶生肉、家禽和蛋類等受規管食物入境香港。

根據《進口野味、肉類、家禽及蛋類規例》（第132AK章），每批次的進口野味、肉類、家禽及蛋類，無論是自用與否，必須附有由來源地有關當局簽發的衞生證明書或食環署的書面准許。從內地到港的受規管食物，進口人士須隨貨提供由內地海關部門簽發的衞生證明書，證明食物來自內地監管當局認可的註冊供港加工企業。違例者一經定罪，最高可被罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。

食安中心人員在假期前夕和期間會在各口岸派發單張，提醒入境旅客和市民遵守有關規定。

食安中心發言人說：「市民非法攜帶受規管食物進入香港，除了會被檢控外，亦需留意這些食物在旅途中可能因不適當貯存（例如不當溫度或不潔包裝）而滋生致病細菌，增加食物安全和個人健康的風險。」食安中心呼籲市民切勿貪圖一時方便，在沒有認可的衞生證明書、食環署簽發的書面准許或進口許可證的情況下進口受規管食物，以免負上刑責和影響健康。

發言人表示，任何未徹底煮熟的肉類及蛋類或以任何形式包裝（包括真空、錫紙等）的生肉，皆受相關法例規管。

食安中心一直致力保障本港的食物安全，並會繼續在各個邊境管制站加強與相關部門的執法和宣傳教育行動。"
