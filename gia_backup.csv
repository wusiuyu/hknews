  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 24 to noon today (October 27), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 347 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website

The Hospital Authority (HA) held the ""Health in Your Hand - HA Go Just One Click Away"" campaign launching ceremony today (October 27), marking the beginning of a new large-scale promotional initiative to encourage the public to download the HA Go mobile application for easier access to public hospital services.

The launching ceremony took place at the HA Head Office and across seven hospital clusters.

The latest promotional video for HA Go was also premiered at the event, aiming to enhance the public's understanding of the diverse functions of HA Go, enabling them to manage their health with just one click.

The HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee, said, ""Since its launch in 2019, HA Go has been well-received by the public. With HA Go, citizens can access various public hospital services more conveniently, quickly and smoothly, while also helping them manage their personal and family health more effectively. We will continue to enhance the functions of HA Go, aiming to make it an essential 'health manager' on every citizen's smartphone.""

As of the third quarter of this year, HA Go has recorded over 4.12 million downloads, with more than 3.25 million registered full members and over 370 000 registered carers.

Mr Fan said, ""The HA's promotion of HA Go marks a significant milestone in the development of Hong Kong's public healthcare services.""

Mr Fan added, Hong Kong is advancing from stability to prosperity. I urge citizens not only to download and use HA Go, but also to care about Hong Kong's future. Let us fulfill our civic responsibilities by voting in the Legislative Council General Election on December 7, electing capable LegCo members to jointly promote the development of Hong Kong and build a better public healthcare system together.

The HA will launch a three-week large-scale promotional campaign to highlight HA Go's features and benefits across various platforms. Hospital clusters will set up promotional booths and arrange for patient service ambassadors and volunteer teams to organise a series of promotional and educational activities to encourage more citizens to download and use HA Go, thereby enhancing the service experience at public hospitals."

The application deadline is February 28, 2026.

The QESS is a major support measure to promote the healthy and sustainable development of the self-financing post-secondary education sector, with the aim of enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the sector. It accepts applications under three project categories, namely theme-based projects, open-ended projects and industrial attachment projects.

Applicants in the category of theme-based projects may set their own themes, provided that the projects are conducted in a collaborative manner, i.e. planned and undertaken by more than one eligible institution, to foster closer collaboration and synergy among institutions and benefit the sector as widely as possible.

The applicants in the category of open-ended projects need to submit applications in relation to the relevant areas of the QESS funding. The main areas include:

(1) improving the overall learning experience and language proficiency of students;

(2) developing and improving teaching methodologies and practices, including the development of assessment strategies;

(3) strengthening and improving quality assurance and related measures; and

(4) enhancing student support and career guidance services, including support for non-Chinese speaking students and students with special educational needs.

As regards the category of industrial attachment projects, applicants can submit proposals within the following areas:

(1) incorporating quality assured work-based learning and assessments into programme curricula through close partnerships with industries;

(2) sourcing more industrial attachment opportunities within and/or outside Hong Kong, and/or enhancement of relevant institutional support for students; and

(3) organising visits or short-term training/courses conducted within and/or outside Hong Kong for students, which are directly relevant to industrial attachments.

All non-profit-making education institutions offering full-time locally accredited self-financing sub-degree or bachelor's degree (including top-up degree) programmes are eligible to apply. Other related bodies such as the federations of these education institutions and quality assurance agencies may also apply. All applications will be considered by the Sub-committee on Support Measures established under the Committee on Self-financing Post-secondary Education.

Since its launch in 2012, the QESS has approved over 120 projects with a total grant of about $455 million. In the 2024/25 round of applications, five out of 33 applications were approved, with a total earmarked grant of about $23 million, which aim to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced teaching resource hub for the sector; develop an AI-powered virtual laboratory platform for healthcare education; establish an industry-university partnerships office; enhance students' emotional wellness and resilience; and provide non-local students with holistic support.

Further details of the QESS, including the scope of various project categories and the application procedures, are available at the Concourse for Self-financing Post-secondary Education (www.cspe.edu.hk/en/qess-project.html)."

  An FEHD spokesman said that the annual FMP New Year Fair will be held for 15 consecutive days from February 17 to March 3 next year. A total of 21 dry goods stalls and six wet goods stalls will be put up for auction, with upset prices of $780 and $770 respectively.

  The open auction will be held at the Assembly Hall, 2/F, Lai Chi Kok Government Offices, 19 Lai Wan Road, Lai Chi Kok, Kowloon, on November 10 (Monday), from 2pm until the completion of the auction.

  Bidders for FMP New Year Fair stalls must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. Anyone can bid for more than one stall. A bidder must pay the bid price and register in person with his or her own name as the licensee of the stall immediately after successfully bidding for a stall. The bidder is also required to sign at once a licence agreement with the FEHD, or he/she will forfeit the rights to operate the stall.

  The FMP New Year Fair will be made available to the licensees three days in advance of the fair (from February 14 to 16, 2026) for the setting up of stalls. In the event of any unforeseeable incident that will cause a reduction of the whole licence period (including the duration for setting up stalls and the business period of the fair), the Government has the right to postpone the commencement date and shorten the duration of the period. The bidding price (licence fee) paid will be refunded to the successful bidder on a pro-rata basis without interest.

  The FEHD reminded licensees that the stalls are solely for the purpose of selling and promoting the sale of the permitted commodities, and no other activities are allowed in the licensed area. If the FEHD considers that any activity conducted by the licensee to publicise, promote, display, show, sell or gift any permitted commodities in the venue is unlawful, contrary to the interest of national security, immoral or incompatible with the object of the FMP New Year fair, the FEHD is entitled to direct the licensee to stop conducting such activity and the licensee must immediatelycomply with such direction.

  Stall licensees should not destroy, damage or abandon any unsold commodities at or in the vicinity of the stall. They must completely remove the stall structure and all paraphernalia, together with all refuse, debris and unsold commodities (whether damaged or not) before 6pm on March 3, 2026.

  According to the licence agreement, except inside designated stalls, licensees must not keep, store or use any compressed helium cylinders in the licenced area. Whereas licensees of the designated stalls may keep, store or use helium cylinders in the licenced area, the quantity of helium should be such that a licence is not required pursuant to the Dangerous Goods (Application and Exemption) Regulation 2012 (Cap. 295E), i.e. equivalent to 150 litres of helium. Sales of floating LED glowing balloons and aquarium fish by stall licensees are prohibited at the FMP Fair.

  In addition, as stated in the licence agreement, the height of dry goods stalls must not exceed three metres from ground level. The height ofwet goods stalls must not exceed 4.5m from ground level. For wet goods stalls with a height of more than 3m from ground level, the licensee must, at their own cost, provide the FEHD with the original certificate issued by an authorised person, a registered structural engineer, or a competent person under the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations (Cap. 59I) to certify the structural safety of the structure in the licensed area before the fair is opened to the public. The licensee must also affix a copy of the aforesaid certificate on the structure of the stall. Also, each corner and anchor point of the marquee (if any) shall be securely fastened using appropriate ballast weights, such as sandbags or purpose-designed marquee water weights. During the period when the Strong Monsoon Signal is in force or is to be issued, the licensee shall immediately inspect the stall and adopt reinforcement measures as necessary.

  Successful bidders shall comply with all the stipulations and provisions set out in the licence agreement. Otherwise, the department is entitled to terminate the agreement and the licensee shall immediately vacate the stall.

The arrangements aim to further streamline the application process and expedite the issuance of licences, in order to provide convenience to food business operators participating in public functions of a short duration.

In accordance with the Food Business Regulation (Cap. 132X), any person who intends to prepare and/or manufacture food for sale for human consumption off the premises must obtain a food factory licence issued by the FEHD before commencement of such a business. For a food business which involves the operation of a stall/kiosk of a temporary nature for sale of heating up/warming precooked food and/or cooking of preprepared, ready-to-cook food for human consumption off the premises in conjunction with a public function (e.g. exhibition, show, concert, sporting contest) of a short duration, a temporary food factory licence must be obtained. The validity period of a temporary food factory licence shall not exceed seven days, and the licence fee is $220.

In order to streamline the application process and shorten the time for applicants to obtain a licence, the FEHD is enhancing the payment arrangements for licence fees. Upon submission of a temporary food factory licence application, the applicant will have to enclose the fee payment for the granting of a licence. The FEHD will process the application as usual. Upon the approval of an application, the FEHD will issue the notification letter and relevant licence to the applicant.

Applicants may submit their applications, pay the licence fees, and collect the licences via electronic means, in person or by authorising another person to visit the Licence Issuing Office on their behalf, or by post.

If a licence application is eventually not approved or cancelled by the applicant, he or she may apply to the FEHD for a refund.

"LCSD to hold vocal lecture series ""The Human Voice in 4 Parts"" in January next year",2025-10-27 14:30,2025-10-27 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700288.htm,"  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department will launch a vocal lecture series entitled ""The Human Voice in 4 Parts"" on four consecutive Wednesdays in January next year. Curated and hosted by voice pedagogue Chan Siu-kwan, each of the four lectures will feature one of the four main voice types (namely bass, alto, soprano and tenor) in Western classical music. Accompanied by selected excepts from Western opera works, the speaker will examine the roles portrayed by each voice type, and introduce the respective iconic legends along with their vocal features, guiding audiences to understand and appreciate the unique charm of different voice types.

  Details of each lecture are as follows:

Lecture 1: Bass
-----------------------
Date: January 7 (Wednesday)

  Two of the lowest male voice types are the bass and the baritone. In this lecture, drawing on performance excerpts of renowned singers such as baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky and bass Boris Christoff, the speaker will analyse the moments when these two voice types assign to take the leading male roles in opera.

Lecture 2: Alto
-----------------------
Date: January 14 (Wednesday)

  The speaker will examine why mezzo-sopranos and altos are often cast as supporting roles such as mothers, ladies-in-waiting or villainesses in opera, alongside the moments when these two voice types assume leading roles. This lecture will also introduce the ""castrati"", a dark chapter in music history, and the countertenors.

Lecture 3: Soprano
-----------------------
Date: January 21 (Wednesday)

  Through a selection of compelling excerpts, the speaker will explore why female leads in opera are predominantly performed by sopranos. Recordings of celebrated performances by divas such as Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland will be presented to illustrate what composers expect of the prima donna.

Lecture 4: Tenor
-----------------------
Date: January 28 (Wednesday)

  In the Romantic period, male leads in opera are mainly dominated by tenors. By featuring treasured recordings of Nicolai Gedda and Luciano Pavarotti, who was hailed as the ""King of High-Cs"", among others, this lecture will delve into the unique charm of the tenor voice.

  Chan is an eminent vocalist and expert in choral singing in Hong Kong. She currently teaches voice at the music departments of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Baptist University. She also serves as the vocal advisor of the Hong Kong Children's Choir. Chan often gives vocal masterclasses, and conducts vocal workshops for singers and choir conductors, in addition to serving as adjudicator in singing competitions.

  All lectures will be conducted in Cantonese and will start at 7.30pm at the Lecture Hall of the Hong Kong Space Museum. Each lecture will run for about one hour and 30 minutes. Tickets priced at $80 (for each lecture, with free seating) are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings and concessionary schemes, please call 3166 1288.

âThe Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson today (October 27) announced that a total of 15 Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs), including Family Medicine Integrated Centres (FMICs), will provide public holiday Family Medicine Outpatient Services on the Chung Yeung Festival holiday (October 29) (see table below). Members of the public can make appointments through the telephone appointment system or the ""Book FMC"" function on the ""HA Go"" mobile application.

As influenza activity remains at a high level, the HA spokesperson appeals to members of the public to receive vaccinations early. Public hospitals and outpatient clinics of the HA have started providing seasonal influenza vaccinations to eligible persons to dovetail with the Government Vaccination Programme 2025/26. Eligible patients may receive vaccinations at their scheduled follow-up appointments at clinics. Patients with distant follow-up appointment dates may visit or contact the respective clinics for necessary arrangements.

Meanwhile, the HA spokesperson reminds the public to stay vigilant about personal and environmental hygiene during the holidays to avoid spreading diseases. Members of the public who develop respiratory symptoms should wear masks and seek medical advice promptly. Non-emergency patients should avoid using Accident & Emergency services and instead seek treatment at FMCs and FMICs, private doctors or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. Members of the public can visit the Health Bureau's Primary Care Directory www.pcdirectory.gov.hk to choose a family doctor and view related clinic service information.

FSD's special operations deployment for hill fires during Chung Yeung Festival (with photos),2025-10-27 12:00,2025-10-27 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102400600.htm,"âThe Fire Services Department (FSD) today (October 27) announced the special operations deployment for hill fires during the Chung Yeung Festival. It also urged members of the public to avoid leaving ignition sources when paying tribute to ancestors at graveyards or visiting the countryside to prevent hill fires.

The FSD is fully prepared and launched the special operations deployment, including setting up a High Command in the past weekend to strengthen co-ordination and the capability to respond to hill fires among operational units. Additionally, through flexible allocation of internal resources, extra frontline staff and fire services appliances were deployed to handle emergencies.

The FSD identified eight hill fire hotspots in North District in the New Territories after assessment. Over 200 additional frontline staff from the FSD and the Civil Aid Service were deployed to form patrol teams to patrol these hotspots. The teams served to remind the public to be cautious with fire, and to quickly extinguish initial fires to prevent the spread of hill fires where feasible.

Meanwhile, the FSD actively collaborated with the community on fire prevention publicity. With the strengthened ties with the District Fire Safety Committees through the FSD Community Collaboration Network, and in collaboration with the FSD Community Emergency Responder Honorary Presidents' Association and FSD Community Emergency Responders, the department disseminated fire safety messages to the public at various graveyards and rural areas over the past weekend.

In terms of technology application, apart from using drones equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast fire prevention messages at graveyards, the FSD also utilised two low-altitude economy Regulatory Sandbox projects for the first time. The department deployed a 30-kilogram payload capacity drone to transport fire-fighting equipment such as flexible backpack pumps and fire beaters to enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, drones and automated drone docks were deployed to conduct regular autonomic patrols in the countryside to achieve early fire detection by leveraging AI technology. The equipment enabled rescuers to appraise the onsite situation more promptly and make deployments accordingly.

As data revealed that most hill fires are caused by human negligence, preventing hill fires relies on the collaborative efforts of various parties. The FSD reminds the public not to leave any ignition sources or to burn weeds in order to prevent hill fires."
消防處重陽節期間應對山火特別行動部署（附圖）,2025-10-27 12:00,2025-10-27 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102400598.htm,"​消防處今日（十月二十七日）表示，該處重陽節期間應對山火作出特別行動部署，並呼籲市民掃墓或郊遊期間切勿留下火種，以防止山火發生。

消防處嚴陣以待並作出特別行動部署，包括於剛過去的周末設立高級指揮室，以加強各行動單位之間的協調和應對山火的能力，以及透過靈活調配內部資源，增加前線人手及消防車輛應對突發事故。

消防處經評估後鎖定新界北區八個山火熱點，聯同民眾安全服務隊，額外調配超過200名前線人員，組成巡邏小隊在熱點巡邏，提醒市民注意火種，並在可行情況下快速撲滅初期火勢，防止山火蔓延。

另一方面，消防處積極集合地區力量進行防火宣傳，透過消防處社區聯動網絡與地區防火委員會加強聯繫，並聯同消防處社區應急先鋒名譽會長會及消防處社區應急先鋒，由剛過去的周末開始，於多個掃墓熱點及鄉郊地區向市民推廣防火安全教育。

在科技應用方面，消防處除使用搭載揚聲器的無人機於掃墓熱點廣播防火信息外，亦首次應用兩個低空經濟「監管沙盒」項目，包括運用可負載30公斤的大型無人機運送滅火工具，如背泵及山草拍等，提升行動效率；另外亦使用無人機搭配自動化無人機機場，在郊野地區自動定期巡邏，並配合人工智能技術以偵測早期火災，有助救援人員能更早掌握現場情況及作出相應部署。

數據顯示，大部分山火都因人為疏忽引起，因此防止山火實有賴各方通力合作。消防處提醒市民切勿留下火種或燃燒野草，一同為防止山火出一分力。"

申訴專員全面調查滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處就滲水問題的處理（附圖）,2025-10-27 11:00,2025-10-27 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700239.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（十月二十七日）宣布展開全面調查，詳細審研滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處（滲水辦）就滲水問題的處理。

滲水成因複雜，包括因樓宇結構或裝置出現問題，又或樓宇欠缺適當保養而引致。若滲水造成滋擾影響公眾衞生、構成樓宇結構安全風險，政府便會考慮行使法例賦予的權力介入。政府成立滲水辦，目標是透過為市民提供一站式服務處理滲水的舉報，加快調查及找出滲水源頭，並提高解決滲水問題的成功率。

公署接獲申訴，指稱因上層單位在平台僭建引致下層單位滲水，但滲水辦未有適時進行滲水調查，屋宇署發出清拆令逾年但僭建物仍未清拆，以致問題持續。

陳積志表示：「巿民大眾都希望有個安穩舒適的居所。但滲水問題一直以來都會為巿民帶來不少困擾。根據政府的統計資料，在二○二二、二三及二四年三年間，滲水辦接獲的樓宇滲水投訴個案分別為39 555宗、45 033宗和47 299宗。公署亦經常接獲巿民就滲水問題提出申訴。另外，有資料顯示屋宇署在發出清拆令後未有適時要求業主遵辦，以致可能因僭建而引致的滲水持續。因此，我決定展開這項全面調查，詳細審研滲水辦就滲水問題的處理，包括納入屋宇署處理引致滲水的僭建物調查的程序，探討當中有否改善空間，並提出適切改善建議。公署亦十分關注滲水辦的整體運作，將以系列形式深入探討滲水辦的調查行動過程及成效，包括滲水辦對顧問公司的監管。」

申訴專員歡迎市民以書面提出意見。請於二○二五年十一月二十七日或之前把意見送達申訴專員公署：

Ombudsman probes handling of water seepage cases by Joint Office for Investigation of Water Seepage Complaints (with photos),2025-10-27 11:00,2025-10-27 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/27/P2025102700244.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (October 27) announced the launch of a full investigation into the Joint Office for Investigation of Water Seepage Complaints (JO)'s handling of water seepage cases.

  The causes of water seepage are complex. It may result from defective building structures or installations, or from a lack of proper maintenance. If the seepage poses a nuisance, public health hazard or a potential risk to building safety, the Government may consider exercising its statutory powers to intervene. To enhance efficiency in handling reports of water seepage, the Government has established the JO to provide the public with a one-stop service. The objective is to expedite investigations for identifying the source of seepage more effectively, and improve the success rate in resolving seepage problems.

  The Office noted from complaint handling that unauthorised building works (UBWs) on a flat roof of an upper flat have caused water seepage in the lower flat. However, the JO did not conduct an investigation into the seepage problem in a timely manner. Although the Buildings Department (BD) issued a removal order over a year ago, the UBWs have yet to be demolished, resulting in the continued seepage problem.

  Mr Chan said, ""It is Hong Kong people’s common hope that they should be able to enjoy a well-maintained and comfortable living environment, but water seepage problems undoubtedly cause much inconvenience and distress to affected residents. According to government statistics, in 2022, 2023 and 2024 the number of complaints about water seepage in buildings received by the JO was 39 555, 45 033 and 47 299 respectively. Also, complaints from the public regarding unresolved seepage problems are common. In addition, there is information indicating that the BD did not promptly enforce compliance with removal orders issued against UBWs, resulting in persistent seepage problems potentially caused by the UBWs. In this light, I have decided to launch a full investigation into the JO's handling of water seepage cases, including the BD’s procedures for handling UBWs that may lead to water seepage, to identify areas for improvement and to put forward appropriate recommendations. We are also very concerned about the overall operation of the JO and will launch a series of reviews to probe deeply into the JO's investigation operation process and effectiveness, including the JO's monitoring of its consultants.""

  The Ombudsman welcomes views from members of the public on this topic. Written submissions should reach the Office by November 27, 2025:

To score an overall pass result, a candidate must meet the passing criteria in both Parts A and B.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""The further enhanced Taxi Written Test will better align with the practical needs of the taxi trade while maintaining the level of assessment, ensuring that taxi drivers possess the necessary professional knowledge and qualities. We hope that more newcomers will be attracted to join the taxi industry to foster the healthy development of the taxi trade in the long run. Furthermore, following the passage of the bill on ride-hailing service, taxi driving licence holders can apply for a ride-hailing vehicle driving permit in future without having to sit an additional test.""

Three persons suspected to be connected with the cases were arrested.

In the first case, two male passengers, aged 45 and 37, arrived in Hong Kong from Hangzhou and Bangkok, Thailand, respectively yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found a batch of suspected cannabis buds, weighing about 3kg with an estimated market value of about $600,000 concealed in vacuum-sealed bags inside the carry-on suitcase of the 45-year-old male passenger. The two persons were subsequently arrested.

In the second case, a 62-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Vancouver, Canada, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 27.5kg of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $5.5 million, in his check-in suitcases. He was subsequently arrested.

The two arrested men in the first case have been jointly charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and they will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (October 27). For the second case, an investigation is still ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Speech by FS at Future Science Prize Science Gala Dinner (English only) (with photo),2025-10-26 20:40,2025-10-26 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/26/P2025102600659.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Future Science Prize Science Gala Dinner today (October 26):

Professor Dennis Lo (President of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences), Future Science Prize Laureates, Mr Victor Wang (Rotating Chairman of 2021 & 2025 Future Science Prize Donor's Congress), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is my great honour to join you this evening to celebrate the remarkable achievements of the seven Future Science Prize Laureates this year: Professor Ji Qiang, Professor Xu Xing, Professor Zhou Zhonghe, Professor Fang Zhong, Professor Dai Xi, Professor Ding Hong, and Professor Lu Chih-Yuan. Please accept my heartiest congratulations.

Their groundbreaking discoveries, exceptional passion and unwavering dedication have not only pushed the boundaries of human knowledge but also inspired generations to pursue excellence in science. Their work reminds us of how scientific endeavour drives progress for humanity.

Tonight, we also mark the 10th anniversary of the Future Science Prize — a decade of recognising brilliance in science. Over the years, this prestigious prize has grown into a beacon of innovation, celebrating the most brilliant minds whose work has deepened our understanding of the world and opened up new possibilities for the future.

More than a prize, what is most heartening is your strong commitment to nurturing the next generation of scientific talent. Beyond honouring established scientists, the Future Science Prize Foundation also puts a bright spotlight on emerging researchers, while actively engaging the public through exhibitions, dialogues between scientists and youth, and other outreach initiatives. These efforts bring science into the heart of the society. They not only ignite enthusiasm in science and foster collaboration, but also help to cultivate a rich scientific culture — one that inspires more people to participate in research and innovation, and contribute to global scientific advancement.

On this note, my sincere gratitude to the Future Science Prize Foundation, the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, and all the partners for the work well done.

Here in Hong Kong, our vision is to emerge as a leading international innovation and technology hub. It will be a key engine of our economic growth and an important source of career opportunities. Central to this vision is the seamless integration of upstream basic research with downstream industrial application. Basic science is the foundation of all technological innovation, and Hong Kong is well-positioned with our world-class universities and research institutions. And together with Shenzhen and Guangzhou, we have been ranked the world's most innovative cluster by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

At the same time, we are actively advancing the commercialisation of research outcomes and building a stronger innovation and technology ecosystem. This is driven by a multi-pronged strategy: first, directing market capital into strategic and emerging sectors such as AI and biotech — that is why we set up the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, which is patient capital willing to invest in small, early-stage companies with cutting-edge technologies, even though their eventual success may be uncertain.

Second, establish a dedicated office, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, to attract leading tech leading enterprises. Third, we also modified our various talent admission schemes to expand our talent pool.

And finally, deepening collaboration with cities across the Greater Bay Area and other areas to enable synergistic collaboration and development.

This is a collective endeavour that calls for strong cross-sector partnerships. I invite all of you to join us in speedily turning this vision into reality.

Ladies and gentlemen, as we bring this memorable Future Science Prize Week to a close, let us remember that science is humanity's guiding light — a universal force for good that recognises no borders.

Speech by FS at Future Science Prize Science Gala Dinner (English only),2025-10-26 20:40,2025-10-26 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/26/P2025102600659.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Future Science Prize Science Gala Dinner today (October 26):

Professor Dennis Lo (President of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences), Future Science Prize Laureates, Mr Victor Wang (Rotating Chairman of 2021 & 2025 Future Science Prize Donor's Congress), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is my great honour to join you this evening to celebrate the remarkable achievements of the seven Future Science Prize Laureates this year: Professor Ji Qiang, Professor Xu Xing, Professor Zhou Zhonghe, Professor Fang Zhong, Professor Dai Xi, Professor Ding Hong, and Professor Lu Chih-Yuan. Please accept my heartiest congratulations.

Their groundbreaking discoveries, exceptional passion and unwavering dedication have not only pushed the boundaries of human knowledge but also inspired generations to pursue excellence in science. Their work reminds us of how scientific endeavour drives progress for humanity.

Tonight, we also mark the 10th anniversary of the Future Science Prize — a decade of recognising brilliance in science. Over the years, this prestigious prize has grown into a beacon of innovation, celebrating the most brilliant minds whose work has deepened our understanding of the world and opened up new possibilities for the future.

More than a prize, what is most heartening is your strong commitment to nurturing the next generation of scientific talent. Beyond honouring established scientists, the Future Science Prize Foundation also puts a bright spotlight on emerging researchers, while actively engaging the public through exhibitions, dialogues between scientists and youth, and other outreach initiatives. These efforts bring science into the heart of the society. They not only ignite enthusiasm in science and foster collaboration, but also help to cultivate a rich scientific culture — one that inspires more people to participate in research and innovation, and contribute to global scientific advancement.

On this note, my sincere gratitude to the Future Science Prize Foundation, the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, and all the partners for the work well done.

Here in Hong Kong, our vision is to emerge as a leading international innovation and technology hub. It will be a key engine of our economic growth and an important source of career opportunities. Central to this vision is the seamless integration of upstream basic research with downstream industrial application. Basic science is the foundation of all technological innovation, and Hong Kong is well-positioned with our world-class universities and research institutions. And together with Shenzhen and Guangzhou, we have been ranked the world's most innovative cluster by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

At the same time, we are actively advancing the commercialisation of research outcomes and building a stronger innovation and technology ecosystem. This is driven by a multi-pronged strategy: first, directing market capital into strategic and emerging sectors such as AI and biotech — that is why we set up the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, which is patient capital willing to invest in small, early-stage companies with cutting-edge technologies, even though their eventual success may be uncertain.

Second, establish a dedicated office, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, to attract leading tech leading enterprises. Third, we also modified our various talent admission schemes to expand our talent pool.

And finally, deepening collaboration with cities across the Greater Bay Area and other areas to enable synergistic collaboration and development.

This is a collective endeavour that calls for strong cross-sector partnerships. I invite all of you to join us in speedily turning this vision into reality.

Ladies and gentlemen, as we bring this memorable Future Science Prize Week to a close, let us remember that science is humanity's guiding light — a universal force for good that recognises no borders. In that spirit, Hong Kong will always welcome global scientific talent and remain open to international collaboration and exchange.

Together, we can build a future of shared prosperity and boundless opportunity for humanity.

And finally, please mark your diary for another important event: December 7, our Legislative Council election day. It is important for our future."
CHP investigates first local chikungunya fever case in Hong Kong (with photos),2025-10-26 19:40,2025-10-26 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/26/P2025102600593.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 4pm today (October 26), the CHP has recorded one new locally acquired case of chikungunya fever (CF), marking the first such case in Hong Kong. The CHP has initiated appropriate infection control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
----------------------------
The case involves an 82-year-old female living in Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin. She developed swollen and painful left ankle since October 18, and fever and limbs joint pain on October 22. She sought medical attention from a private doctor on the same day, and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital the following day (October 23). She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. The patient is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Qingyuan in Guangdong in late August but had no travel history during the incubation period (two to 12 days prior to onset). The case is classified as a local case. The patient has four household contacts who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
----------------------------------------------------------
In response to the abovementioned local case, the CHP today has conducted inter-departmental meeting with various departments and relevant organisations, including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Wong Tai Sin District Office (WTSDO) and Hong Kong Housing Authority, to ensure that all units implement various preventive and control measures in a speedy and orderly manner.

As at 5pm yesterday, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 46 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. None of the 46 patients lives near the abovementioned local case. Given that the activity areas of the 82-year-old patient are primarily within the estate, the CHP cannot rule out the possibility that unidentified infected patient(s) in the area may have transmitted the virus to mosquitoes in the estate, leading to her infection. 

The CHP is implementing prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. The CHP will arrange for laboratory testingif they presented with relevant symptoms. The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams(Care Teams) will contact about 8 000 households and carry out questionnaire surveys to understand and follow up their health conditions. The CHP urged the residents to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 1.

The CHP will hold an online live seminar at 8.30pm tonight. Doctors will explain the symptoms of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents. The CHP and WTSDO will organise a public health talk at the at Fung Tak Estate Community Centre at 8pm tomorrow (October 27) to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others.

In addition, the CHP has set up a health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre, where assessments will be provided to residents with relevant symptoms from today. The CHP will also setup an inquiry hotline (2125 2373), which will operate from 9am to 8pm.

The CHP, together with the FEHD, have inspected various locations in the vicinity of patient's residence, conducted vector investigations and mosquito control operations to minimise the risk of local transmission. Furthermore, the CHP will issue letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and remaining them to be vigilant.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year. In fact, overall mosquito infestation indices this year are lower than that of the previous years. The mosquito infestation index in September was 2.5 per cent, which decreased significantly from 9.5 per cent in June. The index available for October also remains at a low level. Regarding the investigation area of the local case, the latestarea gravidtrap index (AGI) in October was 1.7 per cent, while the AGI in September was 0.9 per cent, indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive. Among which, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, these measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures. The Environment and Ecology Bureau will hold Steering Committee meeting to lead relevant departments to step up mosquito prevention and elimination measures; the district offices of the FEHD will hold interdepartmental meetings at district level to undergo risk assessment and conduct targeted measures.

The WTSDO is working closely with the CHP to disseminate information on CF, including arranging Care Teams to distribute leaflets and surveys to each household unit, contact Link to facilitate the setup of a health consultation booth at the shopping centre nearby, and arranging health talk for the residents to be held tomorrow night.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------
Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Preventive measures taken by the public
-------------------------------------------------
Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

記者：對投票率有沒有一個內部指標？

政務司司長：我希望全港合資格選民都在十二月七日一起投票，因為剛才我說過，在立法會選舉投票對於香港市民很重要，因為立法會與政府的工作關係、市民的福祉，全部都息息相關，所以我鼓勵全部合資格選民投票。

記者：氣氛較激烈，會否預期超過上次區議會選舉的投票率？

政務司司長：我們希望每一屆都很熱烈，希望每一屆選舉市民都出來投票，這是我們最希望的，越熱烈當然越好，因為大家投入，我覺得這是好的。亦因為每個候選人都有不同背景、不同資歷，就算大家同為愛國者，都有些不同的立場，例如有些較注重勞工福利，有些注重商業發展，不同的，所以其實市民都要選擇一個你認為與你自己利益最息息相關的議員，這是我們最希望做到的事，亦是立法會的目的，因為立法會是社會縮影，我們希望立法會每一位議員都能夠代表香港的部分市民，一同議政，對於我們的政策來說非常重要。

對於市民來說，不要以為投票好像事不關己，其實不是的，每次投票都與大家有關，政策如何推出、如何改變，都與每一個市民息息相關。我相信每一個市民不論屬於哪個界別，都希望議員多關注自己界別的事情，這樣的話，就應該出來選一個能夠代表你的議員，因為其實每一個議員都有其立場、政綱，他們稍後會發布，現在是報名參選期間。我呼籲一些有志服務香港市民，有能力、有擔當的，出來參加立法會選舉，我想這都是很重要。

我們在十二月七日前的這段時間，我們會多作宣傳、多辦活動，希望能夠加深市民對立法會的理解和認識，從而在十二月七日出來投票。多謝各位。"

各位街坊、各位市民、各位傳媒朋友：

大家好！今日我很高興，出席「選舉進社區」巡迴互動展覽。西寶城是這個巡迴展覽系列的第一站，從現在開始直至投票日，我們會在不同地點舉辦巡迴展覽，與市民零距離互動，一起了解這場別具意義的選舉、感受選舉的氣氛。

立法會是特區管治架構中非常重要的一部分，肩負着匯聚民意、監察政府、制定法律和完善公共政策等非常重要的職能，與香港社會整體利益和市民福祉息息相關，緊密連在一起。

過去四年，由愛國者組成的第七屆立法會，展現了新的議政風貌，擺脫了過往譁眾取寵、「拖後腿」和對抗式的政治文化。行政立法機關之間重新建立了互信，大大提升了特區政府的管治能力。

對政府來說，我們可以更加專注於制定政策，聆聽理性、務實的建設性意見，盡快落實更多有利社會發展和惠及民生的措施。對市民來說，大家也不用再擔心立法程序被「拉布」等惡意拖延，導致一些惠及民生的法案無法及時通過。由此可見，良好的行政和立法關係，對香港的發展非常重要。

事實上，本屆立法會的議政效率和成果都有明顯提升。在過去四年會議期間，一共審議通過約130條法案，較上一屆立法會的同期超出六成。當中更包括《基本法》第二十三條立法、《2023年區議會（修訂）條例草案》、《簡樸房條例草案》、以至為網約車設立清晰法律框架等不同涉及國家安全、經濟民生以及解決「老、大、難」問題的法案，推動社會發展，惠及民生。

各位街坊、各位朋友，二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行，而提名期已於剛剛過去的星期五十月二十四日展開，為期兩星期，至十一月六日截止。我鼓勵愛國愛港、有能力、有擔當、熱心服務市民的優秀人才積極參選。

而每位市民都有公民責任在選舉中積極參與投票。正如行政長官在二○二五年立法會換屆選舉啟動禮上所說，特區政府會帶領全體公務員積極投入選舉，並為當天需要值班的公務員提供一切可行便利，包括容許他們有秩序地離開工作崗位前往投票、安排足夠替補人手、以及為他們投票提供交通便利等，目的是要起帶頭、示範作用。

至於社會上其他的公私營機構、組織、團體和企業，我希望大家積極響應特區政府和選舉管理委員會的號召，切實履行大家的公民和社會責任，不單只自己投票，也鼓勵屬下人員、員工積極投票，並且像政府一樣，採取各種可行安排，為員工提供投票便利，讓大家都可以安心行使《基本法》所賦予的投票權，為香港的良政善治、繁榮進步以至大家的安居樂業而共同努力。

最後，我再次呼籲全港選民，在十二月七日星期日的立法會投票日，在你們與家人出外用膳之前，又或者如果需要返工的話，在返工前、收工後、或者在返工期間好好利用僱主提供的投票便利措施，履行你的公民責任，為我們的共同家園──香港，投下你手中寶貴的一票，選出代表你的立法會議員，為香港的發展和民生福祉作出貢獻。

「投入選舉，共創未來」！十二月七日希望大家一齊投票！多謝大家。"

而每位市民都有公民責任在選舉中積極參與投票。正如行政長官在二○二五年立法會換屆選舉啟動禮上所說，特區政府會帶領全體公務員積極投入選舉，並為當天需要值班的公務員提供一切可行便利，包括容許他們有秩序地離開工作崗位前往投票、安排足夠替補人手、以及為他們投票提供交通便利等，目的是要起帶頭、示範作用。

至於社會上其他的公私營機構、組織、團體和企業，我希望大家積極響應特區政府和選舉管理委員會的號召，切實履行大家的公民和社會責任，不單只自己投票，也鼓勵屬下人員、員工積極投票，並且像政府一樣，採取各種可行安排，為員工提供投票便利，讓大家都可以安心行使《基本法》所賦予的投票權，為香港的良政善治、繁榮進步以至大家的安居樂業而共同努力。

最後，我再次呼籲全港選民，在十二月七日星期日的立法會投票日，在你們與家人出外用膳之前，又或者如果需要返工的話，在返工前、收工後、或者在返工期間好好利用僱主提供的投票便利措施，履行你的公民責任，為我們的共同家園──香港，投下你手中寶貴的一票，選出代表你的立法會議員，為香港的發展和民生福祉作出貢獻。

「投入選舉，共創未來」！十二月七日希望大家一齊投票！多謝大家。"
衞生防護中心調查本港首宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案,2025-10-26 16:32,2025-10-26 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/26/P2025102600437.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十六日）下午四時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱本地個案，是本港首宗。中心已聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯亞熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名82歲女子，住所位於黃大仙鳳德邨。她於十月十八日出現左腳腳踝腫痛，十月二十二日出現發燒及手腳關節疼痛，同日向私家醫生求診，翌日（十月二十三日）到廣華醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。初步調查顯示，病人在八月底曾到過廣東省清遠市，但在潛伏期（病發前兩至十二日）不曾外遊，屬本地感染個案。她有四名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

政府全方位跟進
———————

針對上述本地個案，中心今日已聯同多個部門和相關機構舉行跨部門會議，包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、民政事務總署及香港房屋委員會，確保各單位從速而有序地落實各項防控措施。

截至昨日下午五時，本港今年累計錄得46宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案，46人都並非住在上述本地個案的患者附近。鑑於82歲患者的活動範圍主要局限於邨內，因此，中心不排除有未確診的患者在區內，將病毒傳播給邨內的蚊蟲，導致她受感染。

中心正按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為個案的家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議，如他們出現相關病徵，中心會安排化驗檢測。中心人員和當區關愛隊會聯絡當區約八千戶民居，進行問卷調查，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心呼籲居民，如於十月一日後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛症狀的人士，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。

中心今晚八時三十分會舉行網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的病徵、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等。明日晚上八時，中心亦會和黃大仙民政事務處在鳳德社區中心合辦教育講座，以期加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。

另外，中心今日起會在鳳德商場二樓設醫護站，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估，亦會設立查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373），熱線由上午九時至下午八時運作。

中心亦已聯同食環署人員實地視察患者家居一帶的地點，進行病媒調查及滅蚊，減低本地傳播的風險。此外，中心會發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。事實上，今年整體蚊患指數較往年為低，九月份的蚊患指數為2.5%，較6月份高峰的9.5%明顯下降，而10月份已有的指數亦同樣處於低水平。在這個本地個案的調查區域，最新10月的分區指數為1.7%，9月的指數為0.9%，顯示白紋伊蚊分布並不廣泛。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。環境及生態局會召開督導委員會會議，指導各相關部門在其所屬範疇內加強防蚊滅蚊；食環署各分區辦事處亦會在地區層面召開跨部門會議，進行風險評估，並落實各項針對性措施。

黃大仙民政事務處正積極配合衞生防護中心發放講解基孔肯亞熱的資訊，當中包括安排關愛隊到鳳德邨逐家逐戶派發宣傳單張和問卷、聯絡領展以協助中心於附近商場設立健康諮詢站以及安排於明天晚上為當區居民舉辦健康講座。

最新監測數據
——————

​自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。
