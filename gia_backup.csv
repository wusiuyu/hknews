立法會十五題：輸入勞工,2025-07-02 18:08,2025-07-02 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200417.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上梁熙議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為政府相繼推出行業輸入勞工計劃及「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），以擴大輸入外地勞工，而其政策原意原為補充勞動人手，以紓緩不同行業人手短缺的問題，但近期個別行業失業率上升，而上述計劃仍持續推行，擠壓本地工人的工作機會。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）二○二三年至今上述兩個計劃所輸入的勞工人數趨勢，以及現時最新輸入勞工人數為何；

（二）自建造業輸入勞工計劃、航空業輸入勞工計劃及運輸業輸入勞工計劃－－公共小巴／客車行業推行至今，每月各計劃獲批的配額及使用配額的變化分別為何；相關行業相應每月的失業率分別為何；

（三）自行業輸入勞工計劃推行至今，當局在審批相關配額時，有否因應當時經濟狀況改變而減少批出配額；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（四）鑑於當局在二○二三年九月四日推行優化計劃後，暫停執行補充勞工計劃下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位的不得輸入勞工的規定，自優化計劃推行後，每月該26個職位類別獲批及使用的配額變化分別為何；同期相關職位類別的每月失業率分別為何；

（五）現時有否措施確保，當相關行業的本地勞工失業率及就業不足情況惡化時，當局會即時調節相關行業的輸入勞工措施，以保障本地勞工優先就業；

（六）有否考慮在行業輸入勞工計劃和優化計劃下設立「階梯式退場機制」（即當本地個別行業的整體經營環境變差的比例，或其勞工的失業率及就業不足情況惡化至特定百分比時，可啓動分階段縮減該兩項計劃輸入勞工的配額），以減少相關行業的本地勞工的影響；若有，詳情如何；若否，原因為何；及

（七）有否考慮將總來港就業勞工人數與本地總體失業率掛鈎（即當本地勞工失業人數增加的同時，輸入外勞的配額亦會相應收緊），以保障本地勞工優先就業；若有，詳情如何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府的人力政策一直以培育本地勞工為主。在保障本地勞工優先就業的前提下，政府適度容許僱主申請輸入勞工。為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，政府已加強輸入勞工的機制。勞工及福利局於二○二三年六月十九日為院舍服務業推出院舍輸入護理員特別計劃（特別計劃），發展局和運輸及物流局於二○二三年七月十七日分別為建造業和運輸業（包括航空業及公共小巴／客車行業）推出行業輸入勞工計劃。此外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

就議員的提問，經諮詢發展局、運輸及物流局、政府統計處及入境事務處後，現答覆如下：

（一）過去三年，各輸入勞工計劃每年獲批准輸入的勞工人數及累計已到港的輸入勞工人數載於附件1。

（二）及（三）「建造業輸入勞工計劃」（建造業計劃）按季（一般是一月、四月、七月及十月）接受申請。申請人一般為未來數月需要開展的工序申請輸入勞工（須先證明按要求進行本地招聘而無法聘請足夠本地勞工）。發展局於二○二三年七月推出建造業計劃。配額分配屬滾動式，即部分工程工序完結後會釋放配額供申請。因此，顯示計劃推出後不同時間的累積批出有效配額數字較為適合：二○二四年七月為9176個，二○二五年六月中為9 056個。

二○二三年及二○二四年，建造業的失業率保持在約4%的水平。二○二五年上半年，建造業整體失業率有所上升，主要涉及普通工人，主要原因是私營工程量特別是私營裝修維修的工程量降低；而建造業計劃只容許申請輸入技術工人，不包括普通工人。

自二○二三年七月推出建造業計劃後，本地技術工人參與工地工作的數目一直上升，直到近三個月才有輕微下降，但仍高於計劃推出前的數目。

運輸業輸入勞工計劃－－航空業（航空業計劃）分別於二○二三年七月、二○二四年三月及二○二五年三月開放了三輪申請，獲批配額數目已載於附件1。

航空業計劃的配額上限為6 300個。訂定計劃的配額上限時，政府已考慮機場人員在疫情期間流失約20000人，適時填補有關人手空缺對香港航空業的復蘇尤為重要；而隨着三跑道系統於去年啓用，機場的人力需求預計只會有增無減。事實上，現時機場的人員數目已由疫後初期的53000人增加至68000人，新增的人員當中約有七成以上為本地勞工。整體而言，相關僱主在每輪申請獲批配額後，按相關程序使用配額輸入勞工。截至二○二五年五月，共有4162名輸入勞工已來港工作。

政府於二○二三年六月公布運輸業輸入勞工計劃－－公共小巴／客車行業（運輸業計劃），並分別在二○二三年九月及二○二四年七月通過兩輪申請批出了共900個公共小巴及800個客車輸入司機配額。輸入司機須通過相關車輛類型駕駛考試並獲得合格成績，以及完成職前訓練課程和取得課程證書後，方可取得相關車輛類型的正式駕駛執照。營辦商亦會在輸入司機投入服務前提供足夠的路線培訓。截至二○二五年五月，共有1494名輸入司機已在通過本地駕駛考試及於相關路線培訓後提供服務，另有80名輸入司機現在港接受培訓，並會在完成培訓後被安排在相關路線提供服務。基於業界持續有人手需求，運輸業計劃有助紓緩人手短缺的情況，補充業界所需的勞動力，確保公共運輸服務的穩定供應。

自二○二三年第一季起建造業及運輸業的失業率數字載列於附件2。

政府統計處沒有編製運輸業之下的公共小巴／客車行業的失業率。另外，由於運輸業之下的航空運輸業的相關失業統計數字是根據較少量的樣本編製，抽樣誤差甚大，因此有關分項的數字不予公布。

（四）截至二○二五年五月三十一日，優化計劃下獲批輸入的勞工人數按26個職位類別、非技術或低技術職位及其他職位劃分的分項數字載於附件3。政府統計處沒有編製按優化計劃職位類別劃分的失業率統計數字。

（五）政府推行各輸入勞工計劃時，致力保障本地勞工優先就業。各輸入勞工計劃的申請僱主須進行本地公開招聘，以不低於當時市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。同時，獲批准輸入勞工的僱主，必須與輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約，並支付不低於相類職位中位工資的薪金，防止輸入勞工成為廉價勞工，損害本地工人的就業機會。

在特別計劃下，勞工及福利局局長會根據院舍業整體護理員人手的需求及供應情況，適時調整特別計劃整體配額及分配每批配額的數量和供應步伐，務求靈活快速地回應院舍業界人力供求變化。

就建造業而言，政府一直以多管齊下方式應對建造業的人力需求，着重加強培訓及推動行業使用科技增加生產力減少人力短缺。建造業計劃是輔助措施，總承建商申請人／分判商僱主須按計劃的要求進行本地招聘並證明未能聘用足夠本地人手，其申請才會獲得考慮。聘用所有輸入勞工亦需遵從與本地從事相類工作勞工同樣的資歷及工作要求、工資中位數等，上述措施旨在保障本地勞工優先就業。處理每宗建造業計劃申請時，發展局會審視申請人有否按政府公布的要求，先進行本地招聘而未能聘請所需技術工人、該工程是否有確實需要輸入技術工人，包括考慮工程的進度、其對每個相關工種的需要及有關人力情況、整體人力市場情況等，從而決定是否批出配額。

至於航空業計劃，在保障本地勞工優先就業的前提下，僱主必須證明即使已進行本地招聘仍無法滿足業務拓展所需人手，才能在計劃下申請輸入勞工。本地招聘職位所提供的薪金必須不少於申請職位的工資中位數，以及符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工（包括經其他計劃輸入的僱員）人手比例2：1的要求。此外，在審批每宗輸入勞工的申請時，運輸及物流局會考慮申請僱主的業務規模和發展需要、對機場運作的重要性、申請者過往在輸入勞工時是否有不良紀錄等因素，並確保有關申請符合計劃下各項保障本地就業的要求，做好把關工作。除有關輸入勞工的措施外，政府一直與機場管理局及航空業界保持緊密聯繫及溝通，並採取一系列措施，包括聯同業界舉辦就業資訊日及招聘會、提升機場員工福利，支持航空業持續發展。

就運輸業計劃而言，運輸及物流局及運輸署一向鼓勵業界優先聘請本地司機。此外，聘用輸入司機的僱主亦須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工2：1人手比例的規定。運輸署在推展計劃時，已成立一個持份者諮詢小組，成員除運輸署外亦包括勞方代表及公共小巴和客車的業界，用作互相交流及溝通，例如雙方對輸入勞工計劃的意見，資方亦可通過這個平台提供職位空缺資料予相關勞方代表，以便他們協助物色有興趣的本地求職人士應徵。

此外，運輸署一向鼓勵營辦商以不同方式改善本地員工薪酬福利，例如增加工資及有薪假期等，締造更理想的工作環境，吸引更多新血投身行業。另一方面，在運輸署與僱員再培訓局協助下，僱員再培訓局與公共小巴營辦商及第三方培訓機構已在二○二四年十二月聯合推出以專線小巴行業為試點的就職掛勾駕駛培訓計劃，鼓勵本地人士加入公共小巴司機行業。首批完成培訓課程及獲得所需駕駛執照的學員已在二○二五年第二季起於相關專線小巴路線提供服務。

優化計劃方面，勞工處為本地公開招聘職位空缺進行就業選配，轉介本地求職人士予僱主面試，並將空缺資料廣泛發布給勞工顧問委員會委員、相關職工會及培訓機構，以便他們轉介合適的本地求職人士應徵。優化計劃亦規定僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職的本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。如有足夠證據證明僱主違反有關規定，勞工處會作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准及拒絕處理僱主在隨後兩年提交的其他申請。為進一步加強保障本地工人優先就業，勞工處已於二○二五年六月十七日實施新措施，包括由當日起獲通過初步甄別並進行四星期本地招聘的優化計劃申請，勞工處在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料時，會展示申請公司的名稱，方便求職人士應徵有關職位。

（六）及（七）由於人口高齡化，香港出現結構性勞動人口縮減。按二○四六年人口推算結果，人口高齡化的趨勢將會在未來持續，65歲及以上長者的人口推算在二十五年間將增加接近一倍。長者人口由二○二一年的145萬上升至二○四六年的274萬，佔總人口的比例由20.5%上升至36.0%。去年發布的「2023年人力推算」報告推算，由於現職從業員高齡化及新進人手不足，預計到二○二八年，人力供應仍不足以填補所有空缺，香港整體人力短缺將擴大至18萬人，比二○二三年多欠13萬人。面對勞動力下降的事實，在確保本地工人優先就業的前提下，香港有需要適度輸入勞工，補充本港勞動力。

航空業方面，根據「2023年人力推算」報告預測，香港航空業於二○二八年的人力短缺將上升至約18000至23000人。考慮到航空業持續上升的人力需求，在本地工人優先就業的原則下，我們仍然有需要通過輸入勞工的措施，補充航空業的勞動力。政府會繼續留意計劃的執行情況，參考新一輪機場人力資源調查結果、持份者的意見等多項相關因素，從而考慮航空業計劃的未來路向。

公共小巴／客車業方面，根據二○二三年公共交通人力資源研究初步結果以及與業界的持續討論，雖然運輸業計劃有助紓緩人手短缺的情況，但仍未能完全解決業界面對人手不足的問題，影響業界對乘客提供優質和穩定的服務。運輸及物流局和運輸署會檢視運輸業計劃的實施情況，並繼續評估行業未來數年的人手需求。

勞工處亦正檢討優化計劃，包括涵蓋範圍、運作和實施安排；促進及確保本地工人優先就業的措施；保障輸入勞工權益的措施；以及其他有關計劃的規定及事項。政府會充分考慮及平衡持份者的意見，從而擬定未來路向。

政府會繼續密切留意本地勞工市場及各行業人力情況的變化，持續檢視各行業輸入勞工計劃及優化計劃的運作和實行安排，致力保障本地工人優先就業。"
LCQ15: Importation of labour,2025-07-02 18:08,2025-07-02 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200422.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Edward Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 There are views that the Government has successively introduced the sector-specific labour importation schemes and the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) to expand the importation of labour. While its original policy intent was to supplement the workforce and alleviate manpower shortages across various sectors, unemployment rates in certain sectors have risen recently. Nevertheless, the aforesaid schemes continue to be implemented, thereby reducing job opportunities for local workers. In this connection, will the government inform this Council:

(1) of the trend in the number of workers imported under the aforesaid two schemes since 2023, and the current latest number of imported workers;

(2) of the respective monthly changes in the number of approved quotas and the number of quotas used under the Labour Importation Scheme for the Construction Sector, the Labour Importation Scheme for the Aviation Sector and the Labour Importation Scheme for the Transport Sector - Public Light Bus/Coach Trade since their implementation; the corresponding monthly unemployment rates for such sectors;

(3) whether, since the implementation of the sector-specific labour importation schemes, the authorities have reduced the approved quotas in response to changes in the prevailing economic situation when vetting and approving such quotas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) given that the exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the Supplementary Labour Scheme was suspended following the implementation of the ESLS on September 4, 2023, of the respective monthly changes in the number of approved quotas and the number of quotas used for the 26 job categories since the implementation of the ESLS; the respective corresponding monthly unemployment rates for such job categories during the same period;

(5) whether there are measures currently in place to ensure that, should the unemployment rate or underemployment situation of local workers in the relevant sectors deteriorate, the authorities will promptly adjust labour importation measures for those sectors in order to safeguard the employment priority for local workers;

(6) whether it has considered establishing a ""tiered exit mechanism"" under the sector-specific labour importation schemes and the ESLS, whereby a phased reduction in the labour importation quotas under these two schemes would be triggered if the overall operating environment of a specific local sector deteriorates beyond a certain threshold, or if the unemployment rate and underemployment rate of its workers worsen by a specific percentage, in order to lessen the impact on local workers in the relevant sectors; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(7) whether it has considered linking the total number of workers admitted to work in Hong Kong with the overall local unemployment rate (i.e. when the number of unemployed local workers increases, the labour importation quota will be correspondingly tightened), so as to safeguard the employment priority for local workers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The priority of the Government's manpower policy all along is to nurture local workforce. On the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government suitably allows employers to apply for importation of workers. To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage, the Government has enhanced the mechanism for importation of labour. On June 19, 2023, the Labour and Welfare Bureau introduced the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for Residential Care Homes (Special Scheme) for the residential care home sector. On July 17, 2023, the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) respectively launched sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction and transport sectors (including aviation industry and public light bus/coach trade). In addition, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

 In consultation with the DEVB, the TLB, the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) and the Immigration Department, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) The number of imported workers approved and cumulative number of imported workers arrived in Hong Kong in the past three years under the various labour importation schemes are at Annex 1.

(2) and (3) The Labour Importation Scheme for the Construction Sector (Construction Sector Scheme) accepts applications on a quarterly basis (generally in the months of January, April, July, and October). Applicants generally apply for importing workers for work activities that will commence in the coming months, on the condition that they can demonstrate that local recruitment efforts, conducted as required, have failed to employ sufficient local workers. Launched by DEVB in July 2023, the Construction Sector Scheme allocates quotas on a rolling basis, i.e., quotas will be released for new applications after the completion of the relevant work activities. Therefore, it is more appropriate to present the cumulative number of approved valid quotas at different times since the launch of the scheme, which were 9176 in July 2024 and 9056 in mid-June 2025.

 In 2023 and 2024, the unemployment rate in the construction sector remained at approximately 4 per cent. In the first half of 2025, there was an increase in the overall unemployment rate in the construction sector, involving primarily general workers. The main reason was reduction in the volume of private sector projects, particularly private renovation and maintenance projects. The Construction Sector Scheme, however, only allows importation of skilled workers and does not include general workers.

  Since the launch of the Construction Sector Scheme in July 2023, the number of local skilled workers participating in construction works has been on an upward trend. While there has been a slight decrease in the past three months, the number remained higher than that before the launch of the scheme.

  The Labour Importation Scheme for the Transport Sector– Aviation Industry (Aviation Scheme) opened for three rounds of applications in July 2023, March 2024, and March 2025 respectively. The number of approved quotas is at Annex 1.

  The quota ceiling for the Aviation Scheme is 6300. In setting this ceiling, the Government had taken into consideration the turnover of around 20000 airport staff during the pandemic. Timely replenishment of these vacancies is particularly crucial for the recovery of Hong Kong's aviation industry. With the commissioning of the Three-Runway System last year, the demand for airport manpower is expected to further increase. In fact, the current number of airport staff has increased from 53000 in the initial post-pandemic period to 68000, with over 70 per cent of the newly-added airport staff being local workers. Overall speaking, relevant employers utilise the approved quotas for importation of labour according to the established procedures after each round of application. As at May 2025, a total of 4162 imported workers had commenced work in Hong Kong under the Aviation Scheme.

  The Government announced the Labour Importation Scheme for the Transport Sector– Public Light Bus (PLB)/Coach Trade (Transport Scheme) in June 2023. Through two rounds of applications in September 2023 and July 2024 respectively, a total of 900 quotas for PLB drivers and 800 quotas for coach drivers were approved. Imported drivers must pass the relevant vehicle type driving test, complete a pre-employment training course and receive its certification before they can obtain a formal driving license for the relevant vehicle type. Operators also provide sufficient route training to imported drivers before they commence services. As at May 2025, a total of 1494 imported drivers had been deployed to services after passing local driving tests and undergoing relevant route training. In addition, 80 imported drivers are currently undergoing training in Hong Kong and will be arranged to provide services on relevant routes upon completion of their training. Given the industry's continued demand for manpower, the Transport Scheme has helped alleviate the manpower shortage, supplement the required workforce and ensure stable supply of public transport services.

  The unemployment rates in the construction sector and transportation sector since the first quarter of 2023 are at Annex 2.

  The C&SD does not compile the unemployment rate for PLB/coach trade under the transportation industry. Besides, as unemployment statistics for the air transport sector under the transportation industry are compiled based on a small number of observations and subject to very large sampling errors, the statistics for this specific sector are not released.

(4) As at May 31, 2025, a breakdown of the number of imported workers approved by the 26 job categories, unskilled or low-skilled posts and other posts under the ESLS is at Annex 3. The C&SD does not compile statistics on unemployment rate by job categories under the ESLS.

(5) The Government has been committed to safeguarding employment priority for local workers in implementing the labour importation schemes. Applicant employers of respective labour importation schemes must undertake local open recruitment and accord priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. In parallel, employers approved to import workers are required to sign a Standard Employment Contract with imported workers, and shall pay a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position to prevent the imported workers from becoming ""cheap labour"" and undermining the employment opportunities of local workers.

  Under the Special Scheme, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare will make timely adjustments to the overall quotas, as well as the number of quotas in and the pace of releasing each batch of allocation under the Special Scheme, with a view to responding flexibly and swiftly to changes in the supply of and demand for manpower in the Residential Care Home sector.

  The Government has all along adopted a multi-pronged approach to address manpower demands in the construction sector, focusing on enhancing training and promoting the use of technology to uplift productivity and mitigate labour shortages. The Construction Sector Scheme is a complementary measure whereby main contractors and subcontractor employers must conduct local recruitment as required and demonstrate that they are unable to employ sufficient local workers before their applications are considered. All imported workers must also comply with the same qualification and job requirements, median wages, and other conditions as local workers in similar positions. These measures are designed to safeguard the employment priority of local workers. When processing each application, the DEVB scrutinises whether the applicant has conducted local recruitment as per the requirements of the Government and failed to employ the required skilled workers, whether there is genuine need for importing skilled workers for the project taking into consideration factors including project progress, the demand for each relevant trade and its manpower situation, as well as the overall labour market situation before determining whether to approve quotas.

  Regarding the Aviation Scheme, on the premise of safeguarding employment priority for local workers, employers must prove that they have made efforts in recruiting local workers but are still insufficient to meet the manpower needs for business expansion before applying for imported workers. The salaries offered for posts under local recruitment must not be lower than the median wage for the applied posts, and must comply with the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers (including those imported through other schemes) of 2:1. Besides, when vetting each application for labour importation, the TLB considers factors such as business scale and development needs of the applicant employers, their importance to airport operations, and any past adverse record regarding importing labour to ensure that the applications comply with all requirements under the Scheme for safeguarding local employment, thereby performing the gatekeeping role properly. In addition to measures on labour importation, the Government has maintained close liaison and communication with the Airport Authority Hong Kong and the aviation industry, and has implemented a series of measures, including organising career days and job fairs in collaboration with the industry and enhancing the welfare of airport staff, to support the continued development of the aviation industry.

  Regarding the Transport Scheme, the TLB and the Transport Department (TD) have consistently encouraged the industry to accord priority to employing local drivers. In addition, employers hiring imported drivers must comply with the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 on a continuous basis. In implementing the Scheme, the TD established a stakeholder consultative group with representatives from the TD, the labour sector and the PLB/coach industries for information exchange and mutual communication, such as providing advice on matters related to the labour importation scheme. Employers can also use this platform to provide job vacancy information to relevant labour representatives, enabling them to assist in identifying interested local job seekers for applications.

  In addition, the TD has all along been encouraging operators to improve local staff salaries and benefits through various means, such as increasing wages and paid leave, to create a better working environment and attract more new talent to the industry. On the other hand, with the assistance of the TD and the Employees Retraining Board (ERB), the ERB, in collaboration with PLB operators and third-party training organisations, jointly launched the ""Placement-tied Driving Training Scheme"" in December 2024, piloting it with the green minibus trade to encourage local individuals to join the PLB trade. The first batch of trainees who completed the training course and obtained the required driving licenses began providing services on relevant green minibus routes in the second quarter of 2025.

  As for the ESLS, the LD conducts job matching for all local open recruitment vacancies, refers local job seekers to employers for interviews, and widely disseminates vacancy information to members of the Labour Advisory Board, relevant trade unions and training institutions to facilitate their referrals of suitable local job seekers for applications. The ESLS also requires employers not to displace local workers with imported workers. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. If there is sufficient evidence to substantiate any violation of the requirement, the LD will impose administrative sanctions on the employers, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refusal to process other applications submitted by the employers in the following two years. To strengthen the protection of employment priority for local workers, the LD implemented new measures on June 17, 2025, including displaying the names of applicant companies when publishing the job vacancies on the Interactive Employment Service website for applications of the ESLS which pass the initial screening and will commence the four-week local recruitment processafter that date to facilitate job seekers to apply for the jobs.

(6) and (7) Hong Kong faces a structural labour force shrinkage owing to population ageing. According to the population projection for 2046, population ageing is expected to continue; the number of elderly persons aged 65 and over is projected to nearly double over the 25-year period, increasing from 1.45 million in 2021 to 2.74 million in 2046. The corresponding proportion of the population is projected to increase from 20.5 per cent to 36.0 per cent. The Report on 2023 Manpower Projection published last year indicated that due to an ageing workforce and a lack of new entrants, it is expected that by 2028, the supply of local manpower will be insufficient to fill all vacancies, resulting in a widening manpower shortage of 180000, an increase of 130000 from 2023. In face of the dwindling workforce and on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, Hong Kong needs to suitably allows for importation of workers to replenish our labour force.

  For the aviation industry, the Report on 2023 Manpower Projection expected that by 2028, the manpower shortage in the aviation industry of Hong Kong will increase to around 18000 to 23000. With regard to the continued increase in manpower demands in the aviation industry and on the premise of employment priority for local workers, there remains a need to supplement the aviation industry's workforce through labour importation. The Government will continue to monitor the implementation of the Aviation Scheme, taking into account various relevant factors such as the new round of airport manpower surveys and stakeholders' opinions, to consider the way forward of the Aviation Scheme.

  For the PLB/coach trade, according to the preliminary results of a public transport manpower study in 2023 and ongoing discussions with the industry, although the Transport Scheme has helped alleviate the shortage of manpower, it has not fully resolved the problem faced by the industry, affecting the industry in providing quality services to passengers. The TLB and the TD will review the implementation of the Transport Scheme and continue to assess the manpower needs of the industry for the coming years.

  The LD is reviewing the ESLS, including its coverage, operation and implementation arrangements, measures to promote and ensure employment priority for local workers, measures to protect the rights and benefits of imported workers, as well as other requirements and matters relating to the ESLS. The Government will take full account of and balance the views of stakeholders when mapping out the way forward.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the local labour market and the manpower situation of different industries, and from time to time review the operation and implementation arrangements of the sector-specific labour importation schemes and the ESLS to strive to safeguard employment priority for local workers."

二○二五年三月五日在第十四屆全國人民代表大會第三次會議上，國務院總理所作的《政府工作報告》提及「支持香港、澳門發展經濟、改善民生，深化國際交往合作」。香港特別行政區政府對此感到很鼓舞，會更好發揮「一國兩制」制度優勢和香港獨特的國際化優勢，打開發展新天地，並提升國際競爭力，深化國際交往合作，強化內聯外通的橋樑作用。有見國際組織是國家及地區之間交往合作的重要平台，香港的執法機構近年亦透過參與各個國際組織的事務，甚至擔當領導角色，以及在香港舉辦大型國際會議，深化國際交往合作，貢獻「一帶一路」倡議，向海外說好國家故事、說好香港故事。

就議員的提問，經諮詢廉政公署（廉署）後，現回覆如下：

（一）廉署積極配合國家的發展戰略及「一帶一路」倡議，持續強化與香港國際廉政學院（廉政學院）及國際反貪局聯合會（聯合會）所組成的「反貪鐵三角」，深化國際交流與合作。同時，廉署與聯合國毒品和犯罪問題辦公室（聯合國毒罪辦）及多個「一帶一路」國家的反貪機構簽訂合作備忘錄，建立合作夥伴關係，共同促進全球反貪經驗交流與專業能力建設，協助各國落實《聯合國反腐敗公約》，成效備受國際社會肯定。

在「反貪鐵三角」下，廉署將其超過50年的反貪經驗，與廉政學院的培訓平台，以及聯合會龐大的國際網絡有機結合，並採用多元化的合作模式（包括舉辦量身訂造的培訓課程、分享實務經驗及進行雙邊或多邊協作等）為海外反貪機構提供針對性支援，將香港的反貪經驗推廣至全球。

廉署透過舉辦大型國際活動，與各地反貪伙伴交流經驗，同時宣揚香港穩健的法治制度及反貪成果。例如在二○二四年五月，廉署與聯合會在香港合辦「廉政公署第八屆國際會議」，匯聚來自近60個司法管轄區180個與反貪工作相關機構逾500名代表參與。該國際會議亦是聯合會的第11屆年會，期間聯合會更發表歷來首個以「香港」命名的反貪宣言（《加強國際合作預防和打擊貪腐香港宣言》），呼籲世界各地的反貪機構維護《聯合國反腐敗公約》訂定的原則，團結一致，堅守反貪使命。會後廉政學院及聯合會舉辦反貪培訓課程，並帶領其中約50位來自世界各地的反貪人員到內地實地考察，深化實務交流。

為培養亞洲區青年廉政意識及激發青年創新力、推動數字防貪及促進跨國協作，廉署將於今年九月，與聯合會及聯合國毒罪辦，在香港舉辦「Coding4Integrity亞洲青年反貪腐程式設計比賽」，邀請來自亞洲共15個不同國家／地區（包括香港、澳門及多個「一帶一路」國家）青年參與，並安排參加者到內地考察，瞭解國家最新科技發展及反貪腐工作。優勝團隊更會在今年十二月在卡塔爾多哈舉行的《聯合國反腐敗公約》締約國會議第十一屆大會的相關活動中，展示其程式設計方案。

廉署將繼續強化「反貪鐵三角」的協同效應，並加強與國際伙伴的合作，透過多元化的交流與互動，深化反貪專業領域的協作，鞏固香港作為國際反貪樞紐的地位。

（二）香港海關自二○二四年七月代表中國香港，再次出任世界海關組織亞太區副主席，任期兩年至二○二六年六月。今年五月，香港海關以世界海關組織亞太區副主席的身分，成功舉辦「第26屆世界海關組織亞太區首腦會議」（首腦會議）。該會議為亞太區年度最高級別會議，約120位亞太地區的海關首長、高級官員及世界海關組織地區機構代表參與。

舉辦首腦會議對香港具有策略性意義。香港海關在會上主導策劃一項運用區塊鏈技術開發驗證平台的創新方案，將有助加快香港以及亞太區域的物流及經貿發展，促進亞太區內的各地海關、物流鏈、資金鏈、貿易協議操作，以及其他相關的服務行業之間的深度融合協作。藉舉辦首腦會議之機會，香港海關在今次會議活動中，介紹了香港的主要景點和本地美食，展現香港作為國際旅遊城市的形象，包括安排參與者遊覽維多利亞港。各種活動不僅為亞太地區的海關首長和高級官員提供了親身體驗香港作為國際大都會的風采和活力的契機，更加深他們對香港的認識。

舉辦首腦會議是香港海關出任世界海關組織亞太區副主席的其中一項工作。香港海關還籌辦多個全球性或地區性的國際會議、工作坊、聯合執法行動以及能力建設計劃。在二○二四年和二○二五年上半年，香港海關已舉辦了12個國際性或地區性的活動，涵蓋多個範疇，例如情報交流、打擊私煙、領犬執法、認可經濟營運商、數據策略及反洗黑錢等，匯聚世界各地代表就相關議題進行溝通及交流。在未來的日子，香港海關更會積極籌辦關於智慧海關、打擊毒品及保護環境及野生動植物等會議及合作計劃，以促進亞太區內執法機構的聯繫、貿易便利措施及發展。香港海關會繼續藉此機會邀請多國海關相關組織人員來港出席活動。

除積極舉辦上述的具代表性活動外，香港海關亦藉參與世界海關組織事務之機會，邀請各國海關相關組織人員更多走訪香港，以促進與其他地區的交流和合作。香港海關在出任世界海關組織亞太區副主席至今，已接待來自21個國家海關相關組織人員來訪。除商討具體海關工作及交流外，亦加強他們認識香港，以促進日後的聯繫與合作，為加強打擊罪案及便利通商奠下基礎。

香港海關未來將會更主動積極，在世界海關組織中進一步發揮「推廣者」及「促成者」的作用，說好香港故事，維護多邊主義、推進國際合作、提升地區執法效能。"
LCQ17: Participation in the affairs of law enforcement-related international organisations,2025-07-02 18:05,2025-07-02 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200377.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

  This year's Report on the Work of the Government of the country mentions for the first time that Hong Kong must deepen international exchanges and co-operation. There are views pointing out that international organisations are important platforms for exchanges and co-operation among countries and regions. Regarding Hong Kong's participation in the affairs of law enforcement-related international organisations, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as the Independent Commission Against Corruption has indicated that it has formed a tripartite partnership with the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities and the Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption, actively contributing to the advancement of the global anti-corruption cause through, among other means, exchanges and sharing of experience with other countries, as well as organising anti-corruption training programmes, whether, in addition to the aforesaid activities, the Government will consider expanding the scale of such activities by taking the lead in organising in Hong Kong larger-scale, integrated international events themed on anti-corruption; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(2) given that the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, in its capacity as the World Customs Organization (WCO) Vice-Chair for the Asia/Pacific (A/P) Region, successfully organised the 26th WCO A/P Regional Heads of Customs Administrations Conference in May this year, whether, in addition to actively organising the aforesaid representative event, the Government will consider taking the opportunity of its involvement in the affairs of this international organisation to invite personnel from customs-related agencies of various countries to visit Hong Kong more frequently, so as to foster exchanges and co-operation with other regions?

Reply:

President,

  In the Report on the Work of the Government delivered by the Premier of the State Council at the third session of the 14th National People's Congress on March 5, 2025, ""support Hong Kong and Macao in growing their economies, improving the lives of their people, and deepening international exchanges and co-operation"" was mentioned. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was most encouraged, and will better leverage the institutional strengths of ""one country, two systems"" and Hong Kong's unique and internationalised advantages to open up new development opportunities, enhance Hong Kong's international competitiveness, deepen international exchanges and co-operation, and strengthen Hong Kong's role as a bridge linking the Mainland and global markets. As international organisations are important platforms for exchanges and co-operation among countries and regions, Hong Kong's law enforcement agencies have deepened international exchanges and co-operation in recent years by participating in various international organisations, and even taking up leadership role, as well as hosting major international conferences, in a bid to contribute to the Belt and Road Initiative, and to tell the world the good stories of our country and Hong Kong.

  In consultation with the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan Chun-ying is as follows:

(1) The ICAC actively supports the national development strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative and reinforces the tripartite partnership formed with the Hong Kong International Academy Against Corruption (HKIAAC) and the International Association of Anti-Corruption Authorities (IAACA), deepening international exchanges and co-operation in the global fight against corruption. At the same time, the ICAC has forged strategic partnerships through memoranda of understanding with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and anti-corruption agencies in various Belt and Road countries. These partnerships facilitate the exchanges of anti-corruption expertise and enhance professional capacity building worldwide, supporting the implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). The ICAC's efforts have garnered widespread international recognition.

  Under the tripartite partnership, the ICAC synergises its over 50 years of anti-corruption experience with the HKIAAC's training platform and the IAACA's extensive global network. Through a diversity of collaborative approaches, including organising tailored training programmes, sharing practical experiences, and undertaking bilateral or multilateral collaborations, the ICAC provides tailored support to overseas anti-corruption agencies, promoting Hong Kong's anti-corruption expertise worldwide.

  The ICAC organises large-scale international events to exchange experiences with global anti-corruption partners while showcasing Hong Kong's robust legal system and anti-corruption achievements. For instance, the ICAC and the IAACA co-hosted the 8th ICAC Symposium in Hong Kong in May 2024, gathering over 500 delegates from more than 180 anti-corruption and related organisations across nearly 60 jurisdictions. The Symposium doubled as the IAACA's 11th Annual Conference, where the IAACA adopted the ""Hong Kong Declaration on Strengthening International Cooperation in Preventing and Fighting Corruption"", which is the first-ever anti-corruption declaration named after Hong Kong. The declaration called on anti-corruption agencies worldwide to uphold the principles of the UNCAC and unite in their mission against corruption. Following the Symposium, the HKIAAC and the IAACA jointly organised an anti-corruption training course, including a study tour to Mainland China for around 50 anti-corruption practitioners from around the world, fostering deeper practical exchanges.

  To nurture anti-corruption awareness and drive innovation among youth in Asia, advance digital corruption prevention, and promote transnational collaboration, the ICAC, in partnership with the IAACA and the UNODC, will host the ""Coding4Integrity Asian Youth Anti-Corruption Hackathon"" in Hong Kong this September. The event will engage young participants from 15 Asian countries/territories, including Hong Kong, Macao, and various Belt and Road countries. Arrangements will be made for participants to visit Mainland China to learn about our country's cutting-edge technological advancements and anti-corruption efforts. The winning team will also have the opportunity to present the solution at an event held in the margins of the 11th Session of the Conference of the States Parties to the UNCAC in Doha, Qatar, this December.

  The ICAC will continue to amplify the synergy of the tripartite partnership and expand collaboration with international partners. Through multifaceted exchanges and interactions, the ICAC will deepen co-operation in the anti-corruption field, and further solidify Hong Kong's position as an international anti-corruption hub.

(2) Since July 2024, the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) representing Hong Kong, China, has taken up the role of World Customs Organization (WCO) Vice-Chairperson for the Asia/Pacific Region (APVC) again for a term of two years until June 2026. In May this year, the C&ED, in its capacity as the WCO APVC, successfully hosted the 26th WCO Asia/Pacific Regional Heads of Customs Administrations (RHCA) Conference. The Conference was the highest-level meeting held annually in the Asia/Pacific region, which gathered around 120 heads of customs organisations and senior officials from the region, along with delegates from the WCO's regional entities.

  Hosting the RHCA Conference bore strategic significance for Hong Kong. During the Conference, the C&ED led discussions on the development of an innovative blockchain-based cross-validation platform. This platform will help speed up the logistic, economic and trade development in Hong Kong and the Asia/Pacific region. It will also facilitate customs administrations, logistics stakeholders, finance and capital chains, trade agreement processes and other related industries within the Asia/Pacific region to further integrate and collaborate. Taking the opportunity of hosting the Conference, the C&ED introduced Hong Kong's key attractions and local food delicacies during the event, and showcased Hong Kong's image as an international tourist city to the delegates, including the arrangement of a visit to the Victoria Harbour. These activities not only allowed the heads of customs organisations and senior officials from the Asia/Pacific region to personally experience Hong Kong's distinctive charm and dynamic vibrancy as an international metropolis, but also enhanced their understanding of the city.

  Hosting the RHCA Conference is one of the key responsibilities of the C&ED serving as the WCO APVC. The C&ED has organised a number of other international or regional conferences, workshops, joint enforcement operations and capacity building programmes. From 2024 to the first half of 2025, the C&ED hosted 12 international or regional activities, covering areas such as intelligence exchange, enforcement against illicit cigarettes, canine enforcement, Authorised Economic Operators, data strategies and anti-money laundering, which gathered representatives from around the world to communicate and exchange views on relevant issues. In the future, the C&ED will organise meetings and co-operation programmes on Smart Customs, drug enforcement, and the protection of the environment and wildlife, with a view to fostering connections among law enforcement agencies in the Asia/Pacific region, and promote trade facilitation measures and development in the region. The C&ED will continue to take this opportunity to extend invitations to various customs administrations to come to Hong Kong for the events.

  Apart from actively organising the abovementioned significant events, the C&ED has leveraged its involvement in the WCO affairs to invite representatives from various customs administrations to visit Hong Kong. These efforts aim to foster greater exchange and co-operation with other regions. Since assuming the role of the WCO APVC, the C&ED has received delegations from 21 customs administrations. Beyond discussions on specific customs matters and exchanges, these visits have also enhanced delegates' understanding of Hong Kong, with a view to strengthening future connections and collaboration, and laying a strong foundation for combating crime and facilitating trade.

  Looking ahead, the C&ED will be more proactive and seek to make greater impact as a ""promoter"" and ""facilitator"" in the WCO through telling the good stories of Hong Kong, upholding multilateralism, advancing international co-operation, and enhancing regional enforcement effectiveness."

立法會︰發展局局長就「設立創新體制機制，全速推進『北部都會區核心區』的發展」動議議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-02 17:32,2025-07-02 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200703.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上就「設立創新體制機制，全速推進『北部都會區核心區』的發展」動議議案的開場發言全文：

主席：

我感謝洪雯議員提出這項動議辯論，亦感謝龍漢標議員、陳月明議員、田北辰議員、劉國勳議員及張欣宇議員提出的修正案，讓我們有機會聆聽各位議員對加快推進北部都會區（北都）發展的想法和建議。

北都對香港社會和經濟發展至為關鍵，可提供的3 000多公頃新發展土地，有助我們突破過去產業發展面對土地不足的瓶頸，加快推動創科以至其他產業發展，並創造約50萬個新工作職位。藉着毗鄰深圳的地利，北都發展亦能夠更好地利用內地和香港的優勢互補，讓我們更深度參與粵港澳大灣區建設。北都亦是香港未來房屋供應的主要來源，可提供逾50萬個新住宅單位，是未來公私營房屋供應的「糧倉」，有助解決本港長期面對的房屋問題，為市民創造綠色宜居的生活空間。

正因為北都的重要性和戰略意義，提速發展一直都是今屆特區政府的工作目標。而事實上，北都很多方面都已經動起來，經過過去三年的努力，我們已在不同方面取得一定成效。

首先，四個新發展區，包括古洞北╱粉嶺北、洪水橋╱厦村、元朗南及新田科技城，涉及超過800公頃土地的建造工程已全速開動。其中，新田科技城的城規程序於去年九月完成後，我們於去年十二月就獲得立法會的撥款展開工程，不論推展效率和規模均是近年前所未見。我們已經在這四個新發展區內收回逾400公頃私人土地，完成平整80公頃土地並陸續將這些土地交付部門或機構興建道路鐵路基建、公私營房屋、學校、公眾街市、生態保育，以至發展創科產業和其他新興產業。河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區的首三座大樓已接近建成，預計首批租戶將在今年下半年開始陸續進駐。而兩幅分別位於洪水橋和元朗的產業用地亦正進行招標，以興建多層現代產業大樓，推動物流等產業升級轉型，亦協助受發展影響的棕地作業者。北都另外四個新發展區的發展建議，包括流浮山、牛潭尾、新界北新市鎮和馬草壟亦已相繼公布，已定出發展的啓動時間和先後次序，現正進行土地用途建議深化工作。總括而言，自從我們在二○二三年提出《北部都會區行動綱領》以來，整體北都規劃已全面呈現，各新發展區和主要基建項目按計劃提速推進，並分別提出了更具體的發展時間表和路線圖，相信都是呼應洪雯議員原議案提出的部分建議。

隨着北都的發展逐漸踏入收成期，在未來五年內，北都的土地和房屋產出將會陸續遞增，包括產出至少570公頃「熟地」，約六萬個住宅單位，以及約100萬平方米的經濟樓面面積。如果我們再推前，在未來十年內，這些數字更會以倍數上升；我們預計屆時北都將產出約1 700公頃土地，新落成的住宅單位數量會增加至21萬個，並有逾1 000萬平方米的經濟樓面面積產出，助力各種產業多元發展。

北都發展要抓對方向、擺好優次，提速提效，體制建設和政策革新相當重要。首先我們兩年前修訂了關於城市規劃、收回土地、填海、道路和鐵路工程等六條主體法例，大幅精簡與發展相關的法定程序，令大規模發展項目，例如新發展區的造地時間由過去約13年大幅縮短至約七年，新田科技城就是第一個受惠於這個精簡程序的新發展區。

為強化北都建設的治理體系，行政長官透過高層次的北都督導委員會，親自領導北都發展。財政司司長帶領北都諮詢委員會做好與各界的溝通協調；財政司副司長與深圳市常務副市長共同主持對接北都發展策略專班，加強與內地的協作。發展局轄下北都統籌辦事處自二○二三年六月成立至今，對內對外都擔當着倡導和統籌的角色。

雖然北都的發展步伐正在加快，但面對外圍競爭，我們的確要有緊迫感，尋求進一步突破的空間。

就着今天討論的議案及其他修正案，容許我先跟各位議員分享一些想法。第一，是關於土地規劃。建設北都首階段工作以規劃為主，具體工作是為各個新發展區制定產業主題和建屋規模。隨着所有新發展區已公布土地用途建議，待完成技術評估後，會在未來一至兩年城市規劃程序陸續完成，因此可以說規劃工作已上正軌。與此同時，規劃是動態的，我們會因應過去幾年的發展檢視早年已定下的分區計劃大綱圖，例如洪水橋／厦村新發展區，考慮深化其產業規劃，放寬產業用地用途，以加入彈性。

第二方面是關乎工程。在規劃格局大致定下來後，工作重點就自然落在收地清拆和「三通一平」的工程。前者目前主要由政府負責，因為收地、賠償、安置始終是政府功能，至於「三通一平」，我們會透過原址換地或「片區開發」讓市場分擔部分工作。第三，關乎產業落地。我認為這是極為重要的一環，尤其值得大家討論。產業落地要有政府的政策引導，亦要有市場的參與。怎麼樣的分工，怎麼樣的架構，最能結合有為政府和高效市場，的確是需要我們集思廣益。

原動議和修正案等建議成立法定機構推動北都發展。政府以外機構，不論是法定或是非法定，好處是不受官僚規章限制，享有運作彈性。但如果有任何建議提出由單一機構管理全港三分之一土地，或在這麼大範圍的某些核心區域，而這些核心區域不單止有產業，還有不同類型的房屋、社區設施，又關乎市政管理等，我們認為並不適宜，亦不切實際。所以在平衡利弊後，我們在去年《施政報告》建議可考慮設立由政府全資擁有的公司，聚焦推動北都的產業發展。各位議員，我們很希望今日可以在動議辯論中，聽聽大家對聚焦產業發展、成立公司這個構思的意見。

最後，我想指出政府對訂立新法例以加速北都發展持開放態度。有意見認為法例應涵蓋跨境要素流通，進一步為發展拆牆鬆綁等等。我們很樂意聽取議員的想法。

在早前舉行的行政長官立法會互動交流答問會上，議員都略有觸及以上的建議，但礙於時間關係，當日只能夠聽到一些較為初步的想法。今日正好提供一個很好的機會，希望各位議員能夠提供多些具體意見和建議，讓我們再作思量。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
LCQ20: Cross-boundary marine tourism,2025-07-02 17:00,2025-07-02 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200639.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Tang Ka-piu and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

It is learnt that the Mainland is actively developing the Nan'ao checkpoint pier project in the Dapeng New District of Shenzhen (the Nan'ao checkpoint), with plans to set up a number of routes to and from Hong Kong. On the other hand, the SAR Government has been promoting multi-destination cross-boundary tourism in recent years, while the Urban Renewal Authority has proposed to develop the waterfronts of Kwun Tong, Kowloon Bay, Kai Tak and To Kwa Wan along the Victoria Harbour into a world-class bay region known as ""Victoria Cove Area"". In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the Working Group for Sha Tau Kok Co-operation Zone set up under the Task Force for Collaboration on the Northern Metropolis Development Strategy under the Guangdong-Hong Kong and Hong Kong-Shenzhen cooperation mechanism has discussed the development of the Nan'ao checkpoint and the routes to and from Hong Kong; if so, of the relevant progress; whether, in view of the opening of the Nan'ao checkpoint, it will consider setting up more sea control points in the eastern part of Hong Kong and introducing more streamlined immigration measures and policies, so as to create favourable conditions for multi-destination cross-boundary marine tourism across Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it has been reported that the Nan'ao checkpoint will set up a route connecting to Ma Liu Shui via Tung Ping Chau, which is only four kilometres away, while Tung Ping Chau, a tourist hotspot in Hong Kong, is yet to be supplied with tap water and electricity, whether the SAR Government will take advantage of the opportunity arising from the development of the Nan'ao checkpoint to work with the Shenzhen Municipality in providing Tung Ping Chau with infrastructure such as tap water and electricity to promote the development of the island; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that the Northern Metropolis Development Strategy proposes the establishment of the Mirs Bay/Yan Chau Tong Eco-‍recreation/tourism Circle, and there are views pointing out that the infrastructural facilities on the islands in such waters, particularly piers or landing facilities, are relatively outdated, whether the Government will allocate resources to upgrade the infrastructure on such islands so as to serve tourists' needs; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) given that the Action Plan for High-Quality Development of the Yacht Industry (2024-2027) announced by the Guangdong Provincial Government proposes to strive for the implementation of a pilot prorgamme for the free flow of yachts among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, of the progress of the SAR Government's discussion with the Mainland authorities on the implementation of the plan, and whether additional measures conducive to cross-‍boundary high-end marine tourism will be pursued at the same time for Hong Kong's tourism industry;

(5) whether, in the light of the establishment of the Nan'ao checkpoint, adjustments will be made to the planning for the Northern Metropolis to dovetail with the relevant development; and

(6) whether it will consider creating a ""cross-boundary marine eco-‍tourism belt along the eastern waters of Hong Kong"" through a multi-destination tourism approach, including but not limited to the development of tourism routes connecting the Nan'ao checkpoint with various scenic spots, such as Sai Kung, Lei Yue Mun (the Sam Ka Tsuen Ferry Pier), Kwun Tong (the Kwun Tong Public Pier and the Kwun Tong Ferry Pier), Kai Tak (the Runway Park Pier and the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal), the Kwun Tong Waterfront Water Sports Centre, the Kai Tak Water Sports Centre and the proposed yacht club in Yau Tong Bay, with a view to utilising existing or planned facilities in combination with eco-tourism and water sports activities in Hong Kong's eastern waters to attract high-value added visitors to come and spend money in Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

President,

As set out in the Development Blueprint for Hong Kong's Tourism Industry 2.0, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) promotes in-depth integration of Hong Kong's unique world-class resources with tourism, leveraging Hong Kong's position as an international metropolis and tourism hub to promote the development of multi-destination travel itineraries and tourism products with other cities inside and outside the Greater Bay Area (GBA). According to the Northern Metropolis (NM) Action Agenda published in 2023, the Blue and Green Recreation, Tourism and Conservation Circle situated in the easternmost part of the NM comprises Robin's Nest, Lin Ma Hang, Sha Tau Kok, Yan Chau Tong as well as coastal villages and the outlying islands. With abundant blue and green resources including country parks, marine parks and a geopark as well as a number of traditional rural townships, this zone has the potential for recreation and tourism development.

Having consulted the CSTB, the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Security Bureau, and the Transport and Logistics Bureau, a consolidated reply in response to the questions raised by the Hon Tang Ka-piu is as follows:

(1) and (5) The Working Group for Sha Tau Kok Co-operation Zone (the Working Group) under the Task Force for Collaboration on the Northern Metropolis Development Strategy aims to promote cultural and tourism collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in Sha Tau Kok. The development of the proposed Nan'ao checkpoint, as mentioned in the question, includes routes to and from Hong Kong and is outside the scope of work of the Working Group. As regards setting up sea travel control points in the eastern part of Hong Kong and developing cross-boundary ferry routes between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, these will involve quite a number of considerations, including the long-term market demand for the ferry routes concerned and the carrying capacity of the region, the required infrastructure and supporting facilities and the cost-effectiveness, and the potential impacts on the ecological environment, etc, which warrant careful consideration.

(2) Regarding the power supply to Tung Ping Chau, the Scheme of Control Agreements signed between the Government and the two power companies stipulate that the power companies are obliged to contribute to the development of Hong Kong by providing, operating and maintaining sufficient electricity related-facilities and supplying electricity to meet the demand. This includes the conducting of feasibility studies and putting forward of proposals for supplying electricity to remote areas. The Government will conduct comprehensive assessments on the two power companies' proposals, taking into account such factors as the supply method, cost-effectiveness and the impact on the environment, etc, with a view to achieving the balance of the four objectives of our energy policy, namely, safety, stability, reasonable prices and environmentally friendliness. Regarding the electricity supply to Tung Ping Chau, the Government has approved the proposals in the 2018-2023 Development Plan of the CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP) to supply electricity generated from solar power systems for Tung Ping Chau. The Government has also urged the CLP to maintain close liaison with the local residents.

Regarding the water supply to Tung Ping Chau, as the permanent residence of the island is sparse, if a treated water supply system is to be constructed irrespective of whether the submarine pipeline is constructed from Shenzhen or Hong Kong to Tung Ping Chau, it is expected that the low water consumption will likely lead to stagnant water in water mains, resulting in deterioration of water quality. Preliminary study shows that the capital cost per capita for the construction of treated water supply system for Tung Ping Chau is very high. Factors such as cross-boundary project and management should also be considered for laying the cross-boundary submarine pipeline. In view of technical and financial feasibility of the water supply system, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) is actively exploring using technology to provide water supply to Tung Ping Chau. To this end, the WSD is providing assistance to a non-governmental organisation to carry out pilot use of domestic seawater filter devices to provide an alternative water source for the villagers of Tung Ping Chau.

(3) The Government launched the policy of Pier Improvement Programme (PIP) in 2017, aiming to upgrade the structural safety and facilities of a number of existing public piers at remote areas in the New Territories and outlying islands, with a view to enhancing accessibility of some scenic spots and natural heritage as well as meeting the basic needs of local villagers relying on boats as their main transportation mode and fishermen's operation. Under the PIP, eight public piers are located within the Mirs Bay/Yan Chau Tong in the NM, of which the construction of Lai Chi Chong Pier, Sam Mun Tsai Village Pier and Sham Chung Pier are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025. The remaining five piers are at the investigation and design stage. Upon completion of the detailed design, the Government will apply to the Legislative Council for funding for individual pier projects at appropriate time, based on the resource priority and related engineering deployment of the public works projects.

(4) The CSTB supports the development and co-operation of yacht tourism in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao GBA, with a view to expanding and promoting high value-added tourism activities in Hong Kong and demonstrating the role of Hong Kong as a core demonstration zone for multi-destination tourism. The Development Bureau (DEVB) and the departments under its purview would make appropriate preparation in relation to land use planning and hardware for disembarkation and shores facilities so as to support the future development of yacht tourism in Hong Kong. With regard to the hardware facilities, the DEVB invited the market to submit expressions of interest (EOIs) for the proposed yacht berthing facilities at the ex-Lamma Quarry site and the expansion area of Aberdeen Typhoon Shelter in the first half of this year, and are currently consolidating and analysing the feedback collected. The target is to firm up the development parameters and requirements, conduct the relevant statutory procedures as needed, and invite tender by the end of 2026 and 2027, or even earlier, for the two projects mentioned above respectively. At the same time, the DEVB released in April this year the preliminary land use proposals for the sites around Hung Hom Station and its waterfront areas, proposing to make use of the water body to the west of the former Hung Hom Railway Freight Yard site to provide yacht berthing facilities. The DEVB is currently consulting the public on the whole land use proposal which includes, amongst others, the yacht berthing facilities. The target is to commence town planning and other statutory procedures in the second half of 2026.

To promote yacht tourism, apart from providing more yacht berthing facilities to address the shortage of berths, the Government will also need to consider whether there is any need to improve the immigration clearance procedures for yachts, the visa requirements for crew members, as well as arrangements and ancillary facilities such as ship repairing and maintenance, which involve the work of various bureaux and departments. In this relation, the DEVB has already made use of the opportunity of the EOI exercises mentioned above to collect the industry's views and improvement recommendations on the development of yacht tourism and the related ancillary facilities. We are currently consolidating and analysing the feedback collected, and will provide them to the relevant bureaux and departments for reference, with a view to facilitating the formulation of more facilitating measures in the future to promote yacht tourism.

(6) At present, Mainland visitors can conveniently enter Hong Kong through various boundary control points to join local tours, including eco-tourism itineraries in Hong Kong. The Government will, under the premise of striking a balance between ecological conservation and tourism development, unveil Hong Kong's precious ecological resources to visitors and develop island tourism. We will also make good use of the coastline and waterfront resources and encourage the trade to develop diversified tourism products.

Under the Tourism Commission's Lei Yue Mun Waterfront Enhancement Project, the public landing facility was opened for public use in June. It has provided better supporting facility for developing tourism products in the eastern waters of Victoria Harbour, and promoting the development of marine tourism. In particular, for the licensed ferry route plying between Sai Wan Ho and Sam Ka Tsuen, some of the existing departures from Sai Wan Ho to Sam Ka Tsuen has been operated via the new public landing facility at Lei Yue Mun on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. The service has commenced since June 28 on a trial basis for six months.

In addition, the Legislation Council approved the amended Protection of the Harbour Ordinance (Cap. 531) recently. The introduction of a streamlined mechanism under the amended Ordinance has facilitated small-scale reclamations to promote harbourfront enhancement and to strengthen harbour functions. We will explore suitable locations for taking forward harbour enhancement works that can upgrade ancillary tourist facilities on both sides of the Victoria Harbour, by capitalising on the streamlined mechanism, with a view to better leveraging harbourfront resources and promoting tourism."

​立法會二十題：跨境海上旅遊,2025-07-02 17:00,2025-07-02 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200637.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上鄧家彪議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉內地正積極建設深圳大鵬新區南澳碼頭工程（口岸）項目（南澳口岸），並計劃設立多條航線往來香港。另一方面，特區政府近年鼓勵「一程多站」式的跨境旅遊，而市區重建局亦建議將觀塘、九龍灣、啟德、土瓜灣的維港沿岸地段打造成「東維港灣區」世界級海灣。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）粵港、港深合作機制下成立的「對接北部都會區發展策略專班」下的「沙頭角合作區工作小組」有否就南澳口岸的發展及往來香港的航線進行磋商；如有，有關進度為何；會否考慮因應南澳口岸的開設，於本港東部設立更多水路出入境口岸，並提供更簡便的出入境措施及政策，以為粵港澳一程多站跨境海上旅遊創造有利條件；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）據報南澳口岸將設置航線往來馬料水並途經離該口岸僅四公里的東平洲，但屬本港旅遊熱點的東平洲至今仍未有自來水及電力供應，特區政府會否與深圳市合作，善用南澳口岸建設的契機，為東平洲提供自來水、電力等基礎設施，以推動該島的發展；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於《北部都會區發展策略》提出建立大鵬灣／印洲塘生態康樂旅遊圈，而有意見指出該水域的海島基建設施相對落後（特別是碼頭或登岸設施），政府會否投放資源升級該等海島的基建，以滿足旅客需要；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四）鑑於廣東省政府公布的《廣東省推動遊艇產業高質量發展行動方案（2024—2027年）》提出，爭取落實粵港澳遊艇自由行試點，特區政府與內地部門商討落實有關方案的進度為何，以及會否同時為本港旅遊業界爭取更多有利跨境海上高端旅遊業務的措施；

（五）會否因應南澳口岸的建設，調整北部都會區的規劃以配合有關發展；及

（六）會否考慮以一程多站的旅遊方式打造「香港東部海域跨境海上生態遊樂帶」，包括但不限於設立連接南澳口岸和不同景點的旅遊航線，例如西貢、鯉魚門（三家村渡輪碼頭）、觀塘（觀塘公眾碼頭、觀塘渡輪碼頭）、啟德（跑道公園碼頭、啟德郵輪碼頭）、觀塘海濱水上活動中心、啟德水上活動中心、擬建的油塘灣遊艇會等，以期利用該等已興建或規劃中的設施，結合香港東部海域的生態旅遊及水上活動，吸引高增值旅客訪港消費；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）在《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》下提出推動香港獨特的世界級頂尖資源與旅遊的深度結合，發揮香港作爲國際都市和旅遊樞紐的角色，推動與大灣區內外的其他城市的「一程多站」旅遊路綫和產品發展。而根據二○二三年公布的《北部都會區行動綱領》，位於北部都會區最東部的「藍綠康樂旅遊生態圈」由紅花嶺、蓮麻坑、沙頭角、印洲塘及沿海村落和外島等組成。區內藍綠資源豐富，包括郊野公園、海岸公園和地質公園等，並擁有很多傳統鄉鎮，具有潛力作康樂及旅遊發展。

就鄧家彪議員的提問，經諮詢文體旅局、環境及生態局、保安局及運輸及物流局後，現綜合回覆如下︰

（一）及（五）對接北部都會區發展策略專班下的沙頭角合作區工作小組（工作小組）旨在推動深港沙頭角的文化旅遊協作。問題提及的擬議南澳口岸發展包括往來香港的航線，不屬於工作小組的工作範疇。至於在本港東部設立水路出入境口岸及發展深港的跨境海上航線，牽涉眾多考量，包括有關航線的長遠市場需求和區域的承載力、需要的基建配套和成本效益，以及可能對生態環境帶來的潛在影響等，需要小心考慮。

（二）有關東平洲的電力供應，政府與兩間電力公司（兩電）簽訂的《管制計劃協議》訂明電力公司有責任為香港的發展提供、營運及維持充足與電力有關的設施，並供應電力以應付電力需求，包括為偏遠地區供電進行可行性研究和提出建議。政府會全面評估兩電的建議，包括考慮供電方式、成本效益和對環境的影響等因素，以達至安全、穩定、價格合理和環保這四個能源政策目標。就供電予東平洲而言，政府已在中華電力有限公司（中電）的二○一八至二○二三年發展計劃批准在當地以太陽能系統供電的建議。政府亦已促請中電與當地居民保持溝通。

有關東平洲的自來水供應事宜，由於該島的常住人口稀少，如要建造自來水供應系統，無論從深圳或香港方面鋪設海底水管到東平洲，預計供水系統可能由於用水量偏低，食水在水管內長期停留不動而令水質容易變差。初步評估顯示，為東平洲建造相關供水系統的人均建設成本非常高昂。鋪設跨境的海底水管亦需要考慮跨境工程和管理等因素。有見及供水系統的技術和財政可行性，水務署正積極研究以科技為東平洲供水。為此，該部門正協助非政府機構試驗以家用過濾海水裝置為東平洲村民提供替代水源。

（三）政府在二○一七年推出「改善碼頭計劃」政策，旨在提升多個位於新界及離島偏遠地方的現有公共碼頭的結構安全，以及改善現有設施，方便市民前往郊遊景點和自然遺產，同時照顧一些主要倚靠船隻出入的村民及漁民作業的基本需要。在該計劃下，有八個公共碼頭位於北部都會區的大鵬灣／印洲塘一帶，當中荔枝莊碼頭、三門仔村碼頭及深涌碼頭預計將於二○二五年第四季完成建造工程。餘下的五個碼頭正處於研究及設計階段，政府會在完成詳細設計後，按工務工程的資源優次和相關工程部署，適時為個別碼頭項目向立法會申請撥款。

（四）文體旅局支持粵港澳大灣區遊艇旅遊的發展和合作，以拓展和促進香港高增值旅遊活動，發揮香港「一程多站」示範核心區的角色。為配合香港未來遊艇旅遊的發展，發展局及其轄下部門會就土地規劃和登岸及岸上硬件配套設施作出合適部署。在硬件配套方面，發展局於今年上半年邀請市場就在前南丫石礦場及香港仔避風塘擴建部分發展遊艇停泊設施提交意向書，現時正整理及分析蒐集到的意見。目標是在今年內敲定上述兩個項目的發展參數和要求，按需要進行相關的法定程序，繼而分別在二○二六年年底及二○二七年或更早時間進行招標。與此同時，發展局於今年四月公布紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地的初步土地用途建議，提出在前紅磡鐵路貨運碼頭用地以西的水體提供遊艇停泊設施。發展局現正就包括遊艇停泊設施在內的整個土地用途建議進行公眾諮詢。目標是在二○二六年下半年開展城規和其他法定程序。

要推動遊艇旅遊，除增加遊艇停泊設施以解決泊位不足的問題外，政府亦要考慮是否需要優化例如遊艇出入境、船員簽證、以至維修保養等的安排及配套設施，涉及不同政策局和部門的工作。就此，發展局已利用上述進行市場意向調查的契機，一併了解業界對發展遊艇旅遊及相關配套設施的意見和改善建議。我們現時正整理及分析蒐集到的意見，供相關政策局和部門參考，以助在未來制訂更多不同的便利措施，推動遊艇旅遊。

（六）現時內地遊客可以便捷地經各出入境口岸入境香港參加本地行程，包括香港境內的生態旅遊路線。特區政府會在平衡生態保育及旅遊發展的前提下，向訪客展現香港擁有的珍貴生態資源和發展海島旅遊。我們亦會善用海岸線和海濱資源，並鼓勵業界開發多元化的特色旅遊產品。

旅遊事務署推行的鯉魚門海旁改善計劃下的公眾登岸設施已於今年六月啓用。新的公眾登岸設施為開拓維港東部水域的旅遊產品，以至推動海上旅遊發展帶來更好的配套支援。其中現時往返西灣河及三家村的持牌渡輪航線於星期六、日及公眾假期，部分由西灣河開往三家村的現有班次會途經鯉魚門新的公眾登岸設施。有關服務已於今年六月二十八日起以試行形式營運，為期六個月。

此外，立法會近月通過經修訂的《保護海港條例》（第531章）。修例後引入簡化機制，便利促進優化海濱和加強海港功能的小規模填海工程。我們會善用經拆牆鬆綁的機制，探討在合適的地方推展能提升維港兩岸旅遊潛力的改善海港工程，進一步善用維港的海濱資源，推廣旅遊。"

​立法會十九題：與工業相關的統計和研究,2025-07-02 16:36,2025-07-02 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200630.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上吳永嘉議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

創新科技及工業局早前聯同政府統計處（統計處）擬訂香港製造及新型工業產業的經濟活動涵蓋範圍，並發表有關活動的經濟表現數字，以更準確反映香港新型工業的經濟表現。此外，政府在二○二四年施政報告指出，計劃於今年內開展香港新型工業中長期發展方案研究（研究），加速推進具香港優勢的「新型工業化」。據悉業界人士期待政府發布更多與相關工業的統計和研究，特別是統計在境外營運的港資製造業企業的經營狀況。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述經濟表現統計數字會否同時涵蓋在境外營運的港資製造業企業；如否，原因為何；

（二）該研究預計於何時完成，以及其研究範圍會否涵蓋在境外營運的港資製造業企業的經營情況；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；當局日後會否恆常地委聘顧問進行該研究；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）未來會否進行更多不同層面的工業統計和研究，例如會否參照統計處的離岸貿易及商貿活動的統計方法，對在海內外經營的港資製造業企業進行全面調查，並建立常規化的香港離岸工業統計指標；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）據悉現時《工業的業務表現及營運特色的主要統計數字》有就從事分判製造工序及提供與製造業相關技術支援服務的進出口貿易公司進行統計，上述經濟表現統計數字未有涵蓋離岸銷售的原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就吳永嘉議員的提問，經諮詢政府統計處（統計處）後，現回覆如下：

（一）用以量度「製造及新型工業產業」經濟表現的統計數字是按本地生產總值的統計框架計算，其涵蓋範圍只包括相關的居民生產單位。根據國際統計標準，由於境外企業並非香港居民生產單位，因此其經濟活動並不會計入香港的「製造及新型工業產業」；然而，支援這些港資境外製造業企業並提供數據服務、軟件開發，以及其他相關專業技術服務的香港企業，會計入「製造及新型工業產業」以量度有關活動對香港本地生產總值的貢獻。

（二）為進一步完善新型工業發展和體制建設，實踐《香港創新科技發展藍圖》的頂層設計及發展路徑，我們將展開香港新型工業中長期發展方案研究，更好地了解香港新型工業化發展現狀和業界訴求，系統梳理現有的政策措施，進而更有效地鼓勵傳統製造業利用創科升級轉型，支持策略性新興產業發展，扶持初創企業並布局未來產業，強化支援相關專業服務業，加速推進具香港優勢的新型工業化。我們將在今年第三季內開展研究。其後，我們將要求顧問機構在二○二六年完成研究，並將會充分考慮顧問研究報告所提出的建議，因地制宜地優化及落實推動新型工業化的政策及措施，支持香港高質量發展。由於即將展開招標流程，我們現階段未能公布過多信息。我們將持續密切留意香港新型工業化發展狀況，按實際需要檢視現有政策或制訂新措施，包括但不限於考慮在有必要時開展有關新型工業化的進一步研究。目前，我們並無計劃將相關研究恆常化。

（三）就香港公司的離岸業務情況，統計處除了編製離岸貿易及商貿活動統計外，亦會就香港公司根據合約將生產工序由香港分判予中國內地（內地）及其他地區進行，編製香港進出口貿易公司分判製造工序予內地及其他地區的相關統計數字（例如：機構單位數目、就業人數、行業增加價值及銷售收益）。

至於港資在外地經營的機構的業務情況，包括位於中國內地及其他地區的機構，統計處有實際困難直接在香港範圍以外進行統計調查，以搜集這些機構的資料。至於與這些外地機構有關聯的本地機構，由於兩者為獨立個體，該些本地機構亦往往不能提供相關外地機構的詳細營運資料。因此，統計處沒有計劃編製港資在外地經營的機構的詳細業務統計數字。

（四）隨着全球價值鏈的不斷演變，當中衍生更多有關分判製造工序及相關的離岸活動，編製有關的統計數字在國際統計界是一項挑戰。聯合國統計委員會正就現行有關的宏觀經濟統計的國際標準進行檢討及更新。統計處亦正就相關課題進行研究，檢視最新的國際統計發展，以進行相關統計系統的優化工作。"
LCQ19: Industry-related statistics and studies,2025-07-02 16:36,2025-07-02 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200635.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Jimmy Ng and a written reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

  In collaboration with the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau has earlier devised a domain of economic activities comprising manufacturing and new industrialisation-related industries in Hong Kong and released statistics on the economic performance of relevant activities, so as to reflect the economic performance of Hong Kong's new industries more precisely. In addition, as stated in the 2024 Policy Address, the Government plans to commence a study on ""the medium to long-term development plan for new industrialisation in Hong Kong"" (the study) within this year to accelerate the promotion of ""new industrialisation"" with Hong Kong's competitive edges. It is learnt that members of the industries expect that the Government will release more statistics and study reports on the relevant industries, in particular, statistics on the operating situations of Hong Kong manufacturing enterprises operating outside Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the aforementioned economic performance statistics will also cover Hong Kong manufacturing enterprises operating outside Hong Kong; if not, of the reasons for that;

(2) of the expected completion time of the study, and whether the scope of the study will cover the operating situations of Hong Kong manufacturing enterprises operating outside Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; whether the authorities will engage consultants to conduct such a study on a regular basis in the future; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it will compile more industrial statistics and conduct more studies at different levels in future, e.g. whether it will, by drawing reference to C&SD's statistical methodology for the statistics on offshore trade and merchanting activities, conduct a comprehensive survey on Hong Kong manufacturing enterprises operating in the Mainland and overseas, and develop regular statistical indicators on the offshore industrial sector for Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) as it is learnt that at present, the Key Statistics on Business Performance and Operating Characteristics of the Industrial Sector include statistics on import and export firms engaged in sub-contract processing arrangement and providing manufacturing-related technical support services, of the reasons why offshore sales are not covered in the aforementioned economic performance statistics?

Reply:

President,

  Our response to the question raised by the Hon Jimmy Ng, in consultation with the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), is as follows:

(1) The statistics measuring the economic performance of Manufacturing and New Industrialisation-related Industries are compiled based on the statistical framework of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which covers resident producing units only. According to international statistical standard, as offshore enterprises are not resident producing units of Hong Kong, their economic activities are not included in Hong Kong's Manufacturing and New Industrialisation-related Industries. However, Hong Kong enterprises that are engaging in data services, software development, and other related professional technical services for supporting Hong Kong-owned offshore manufacturing enterprises are included in Manufacturing and New Industrialisation-related Industries for measuring their contribution to the GDP of Hong Kong.

(2) To further enhance the systemic development of new industries with a view to realising the top-level design and developmental direction set out in the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint, we will launch a study on the medium to long-term development plan for new industrialisation in Hong Kong, in order to better understand the current development of new industrialisation in Hong Kong and demands from the industry, and systematically analyse existing policy measures, thereby more effectively encourage traditional manufacturers to employ innovation and technology to undergo upgrading and transformation, support the development of strategic and emerging industries, as well as start-ups and future industries, strengthen support for relevant professional services, and expeditiously drive new industrialisation with Hong Kong advantages. We will launch the study within third quarter of this year. Thereafter, we will ask the consulting institution to conclude the study within 2026, and will, taking into full account the recommendations set out in the consultancy study report and Hong Kong's local conditions, enhance and implement policies and measures that can drive new industrialisation, to support high quality development. As the tendering process is about to begin, we are unable to provide too much information at this stage. We will continue to closely monitor the development of new industrialisation in Hong Kong, and inspect existing measures or devise new ones in accordance with practical need, including but not limited to considering to launch further studies on new industrialisation. As of now, we do not have plans to regularly conduct relevant studies.

(3) Regarding the offshore business of Hong Kong companies, in addition to compiling statistics on offshore trade and merchanting activities, the C&SD also compiles statistics (e.g. number of establishments, number of persons employed, value added of the industry and sales revenue) relating to the sub-contracting of manufacturing processes by Hong Kong import/export trading companies to the mainland of China (the Mainland) and other regions, in respect of Hong Kong companies which sub-contract their production processes to the Mainland and other regions according to contractual agreement.

As regards business situation of non-local Hong Kong-funded companies, including those located on the Mainland and other regions, the C&SD has practical difficulties in conducting statistical surveys outside Hong Kong to directly collect their data. As for the local companies related to these non-local companies, as the two are independent entities, the local companies concerned are often unable to provide the detailed operating data of the relevant non-local companies. Hence, the C&SD has no plan to compile detailed business statistics of non-local Hong Kong-funded companies.

(4) As the global value chain continues to evolve, more sub-contracting manufacturing processes and related offshore activities have emerged. The compilation of related statistics is a challenge to the international statistical community. The United Nations Statistical Commission is reviewing and updating the current international standards on relevant macroeconomic statistics. The C&SD is also conducting research on related topics and reviewing the latest international statistical developments with a view to enhancing the relevant statistical systems."

黃嘉純主席（龍傳基金主席）、陳維安會長（香港青年協會會長）、張國來巡視員（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室青年工作部二級巡視員）、王䓪鳴博士（龍傳基金董事）、我的師姐、師兄、藍爺（龍傳基金創會董事藍鴻震）、Annie（龍傳基金義務秘書譚贛蘭教授）、各位龍傳基金代表、各位香港青年協會代表、各位嘉賓、各位年輕朋友：

大家好。

我很榮幸今日跟大家聚首一堂，參與龍傳基金25周年誌慶暨《中國歷史文化周》啓動禮。今日除了是龍傳基金成立25周年，亦是剛才Kenneth（香港青年協會會長陳維安）說的香港青年協會65周年誌慶。首先，我向龍傳基金及香港青年協會致以最熱烈的祝賀，衷心感謝你們一直為傳承中華文化、促進社會共融和服務青年作出了卓越的貢獻。

自二○一一年開始，香港青年協會每年都主辦《中國歷史文化周》，透過一系列的專題和教育活動，啓發青年人認識博大精深的中華文化，了解其源遠流長的歷史脈絡。在這個過程當中，青年人能夠從歷史中汲取智慧，鑑古知今，進而關心社會和國家的發展方向，促進跨世代、跨文化的對話。今年，《中國歷史文化周》以「龍騰舞動——傳承龍的文化及精神」作為主題，不單是幫助參加者深入了解龍與傳統文化，更是探索其在當代社會意義的最佳機會。

龍，是中華民族的圖騰，象徵吉祥、尊貴，也傳遞堅毅、團結、積極進取的精神。這形象不僅植根於中華文化的核心，也見諸於我們日常生活中，如建築、雕刻、書法、刺繡及圖像等。香港有不少非遺（非物質文化遺產）項目，如外面也有展出的舞火龍、龍舟競渡，甚至傳統小吃龍鬚糖，都充分體現龍的象徵意義。這些傳統文化能夠薪火相傳，並植根於香港文化的土壤，離不開一代又一代文化傳承者的堅持和承擔。

香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心，擁有獨特的優勢，不僅融匯中外文化，更能將傳統與創新緊密相連。如果年輕一代能夠擁抱香港的多樣性和包容性，必定能夠進一步激發創意和活力，為中華文化注入更多生機，延續其強大的國家軟實力。

當今世代日新月異，傳承與創新是密不可分。我很高興今日亦能夠參與「龍騰舞動」AI創意比賽頒獎禮。今次比賽巧妙地將傳統中國歷史文化與現代科技結合起來，每一位參加者的作品都為我們帶來全新的視角，探索如何以創新的方式傳承和宏揚龍的文化，充分展現中華文化的活力和創造力。

在此，我再次感謝所有為《中國歷史文化周》付出努力的人士，以及今日在場每一位的支持，感謝你們對文化傳承的堅持和創意。祝願《中國歷史文化周》2025圓滿成功。

多謝大家。"

Provisional statistics of retail sales for May 2025,2025-07-02 16:30,2025-07-02 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200582.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released the latest figures on retail sales today (July 2).

  The value of total retail sales in May 2025, provisionally estimated at $31.3 billion, increased by 2.4% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of the value of total retail sales in April 2025 decreased by 2.3% compared with a year earlier. For the first 5 months of 2025 taken together, it was provisionally estimated that the value of total retail sales decreased by 4.0% compared with the same period in 2024.

The value of online retail sales in that month, provisionally estimated at $2.6 billion, increased by 0.3% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of online retail sales in April 2025 decreased by 3.7% compared with a year earlier. For the first 5 months of 2025 taken together, it was provisionally estimated that the value of online retail sales decreased by 1.7% compared with the same period in 2024.

  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in May 2025 increased by 1.9% compared with a year earlier. The revised estimate of the volume of total retail sales in April 2025 decreased by 3.3% compared with a year earlier. For the first 5 months of 2025 taken together, the provisional estimate of the total retail sales decreased by 5.5% in volume compared with the same period in 2024.

  Analysed by broad type of retail outlet in descending order of the provisional estimate of the value of sales and comparing May 2025 with May 2024, the value of sales of other consumer goods not elsewhere classified increased by 8.9%. This was followed by sales of commodities in supermarkets (+1.3% in value); wearing apparel (+0.4%); food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco (+2.8%); commodities in department stores (+6.3%); medicines and cosmetics (+8.7%); electrical goods and other consumer durable goods not elsewhere classified (+0.9%); motor vehicles and parts (+2.7%); books, newspapers, stationery and gifts (+1.6%); and optical shops (+1.4%).

This was followed by sales of fuels (-6.9% in value); footwear, allied products and other clothing accessories (-0.1%); furniture and fixtures (-12.0%); and Chinese drugs and herbs (-2.2%).

  Based on the seasonally adjusted series, the provisional estimate of the value of total retail sales increased by 4.1% in the three months ending May 2025 compared with the preceding three-month period, while the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales increased by 7.0%.

Commentary

  A government spokesman said that retail sales performance saw improvement in May 2025. The value of total retail sales turned to a year-on-year increase of 2.4%. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the value of total retail sales increased by 7.0% over the preceding month.

  Looking ahead, the spokesman said that while the retail sector continues to adapt to the changes in consumption patterns, the Government's proactive efforts in promoting tourism and mega events, in tandem with the increase in employment earnings and sustained steady growth of the Mainland economy, will help bolster consumption sentiment and support the consumption market.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the revised figures on value index and value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for April 2025 as well as the provisional figures for May 2025. The provisional figures on the value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet as well as the corresponding year-on-year changes for the first 5 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 2 presents the revised figures on value of online retail sales for April 2025 as well as the provisional figures for May 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first 5 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 3 presents the revised figures on volume index of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for April 2025 as well as the provisional figures for May 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first 5 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 4 shows the movements of the value and volume of total retail sales in terms of the year-on-year rate of change for a month compared with the same month in the preceding year based on the original series, and in terms of the rate of change for a three-month period compared with the preceding three-month period based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The classification of retail establishments follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  These retail sales statistics measure the sales receipts in respect of goods sold by local retail establishments and are primarily intended for gauging the short-term business performance of the local retail sector. Data on retail sales are collected from local retail establishments through the Monthly Survey of Retail Sales (MRS). Local retail establishments with and without physical shops are covered in MRS and their sales, both through conventional shops and online channels, are included in the retail sales statistics.

  The retail sales statistics cover consumer spending on goods but not on services (such as those on housing, catering, medical care and health services, transport and communication, financial services, education and entertainment) which account for over 50% of the overall consumer spending. Moreover, they include spending on goods in Hong Kong by visitors but exclude spending outside Hong Kong by Hong Kong residents. Hence they should not be regarded as indicators for measuring overall consumer spending.

  Users interested in the trend of overall consumer spending should refer to the data series of private consumption expenditure (PCE), which is a major component of the Gross Domestic Product published at quarterly intervals. Compiled from a wide range of data sources, PCE covers consumer spending on both goods (including goods purchased from all channels) and services by Hong Kong residents whether locally or abroad. Please refer to the C&SD publication ""Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Component"" for more details.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey of Retail Sales"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080003&scode=530).

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-07-02 16:21,2025-07-02 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200615.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on June 30 to noon today (July 2), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 215 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 100 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 147 826 samples of food imported from Japan (including 97 116 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 33 742 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

Question:

The Government indicated in its reply to a question from a Member of this Council on May 14 this year that the Water Intelligent Network (WIN) implemented by the Water Supplies Department has completed the establishment of all 2 400 district metering areas (DMAs) by the end of March this year to help strengthen the management of leakage in water supply networks. However, it has been reported that incidents of underground water mains burst still occurred frequently, and multiple incidents of water mains burst even occurred in Tuen Mun District within a week in early June this year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has examined the reasons for the occurrence of underground water mains burst incidents one after another after the completion of the establishment of WIN, and whether it has explored improvement proposals;

(2) whether it has plans to establish more discrete DMAs within the fresh water distribution network in Hong Kong as well as install more high-technology monitoring and sensing equipment in WIN, so as to identify abnormalities in underground water mains at an early stage and strengthen the effectiveness of monitoring; and

(3) of the measures in place to minimise the impact of large-scale water mains burst incidents, including whether consideration has been given to installing backup water supply networks in districts with ageing water mains (e.g. Tuen Mun District), so as to minimise the impact of water outage on local residents and businesses in the event of the occurrence of incidents?

Reply:

President,

The reply to the questions raised by the Hon Chow is as follows:

(1)Since 2016, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) has been establishing the Water Intelligence Network (WIN) and completed the setup of 2 400 District Metering Areas (DMAs) by the end of March 2025, covering about 80 per cent of the distribution network, to enhance the management of pipe leakage. In 2024, the WSD detected over 1 200 cases of water mains leaks in government fresh water mains through WIN, facilitating the department to carry out early maintenance works. The leakage rate of water mains has decreased from about 25per cent in 2000 to about 13.4per cent last year.

However, the DMAs of WIN currently do not cover the fresh water trunk mains and approximately 20per cent of the fresh water distribution network. We have to extend its coverage. Additionally, some aged water mains, such as those made of cast iron and asbestos cement, have relatively fragile exteriors. Even the water mains laid within the DMAs of WIN, they may suddenly burst upon external force impact, so we need to schedule the replacement of these water mains taking into account risk factors.

(2)Considering the above factors, the WSD began expanding the DMAs of WIN to fresh water trunk mains and the remaining 20per cent fresh water distribution network at the end of last year. Besides, the WSD has been upgrading sensors for monitoring water flow and pressure to expedite the identification and handling of water mains with potential burst risks. The above WIN expansion and upgrading project is expected to be completed by 2027, and we have requested the WSD to explore the possibility of completing it earlier.

In addition, the WSD has been collaborating with local and Mainland academic and research institutions to study the application of other advanced technologies, such as sonar surveys and fibre-optic technology, to detect pipe leakage early. The WSD will collaborate with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to establish a joint laboratory of ""In-line Robot"" in August this year to conduct high-precision inspections of water mains.

To get real-time data from different parts of the entire water supply system, we also need to work on the user end. In this regard, the WSD has mandated the installation of smart water meters in new building projects since 2018. As for existing buildings, the WSD also plans to progressively promote the installation, targeting to regulate water pressure in the water mains according to users' daily living patterns in order to implement ""dynamic pressure reduction"" in the entire water supply system to reduce the risk of water mains burst and leakage.

(3) The WSD implemented a territory-wide water mains replacement and rehabilitation programme between 2000 and 2015 to replace and rehabilitate about 3 000 kilometres long aged water mains.

From 2015 to March 2025, about 240 kilometres long water mains have been replaced or rehabilitated. The WSD obtained funding approval from the Legislative Council last year to replace or rehabilitate about 20 kilometres of large steel water mains. These improvement works, including about four kilometres in Tuen Mun District, are preliminarily expected to be completed by 2029 progressively.

The WSD will review the factors for water mains replacement including the risk and consequences of water mains leaks or bursts and thereby the priority of water mains replacement, and will submit short- and medium-term plans for the Development Bureau's consideration shortly.

Currently, the WSD has provided dual water mains for critical facilities (e.g. hospitals) to enhance water supply resilience. However, if a backup water mains is to be established in all areas with aged water mains, multiple factors need to be considered. These include the congested underground facilities in urban areas and whether there is available underground space, and whether the approach is cost-effective, as the construction and management of backup water mains that are mostly in standby mode will inevitably involve significant additional resources.

In the event of water main burst, the WSD will take appropriate measures to minimise the affected extent and duration of water suspension as far as possible, including temporarily redirecting water supply through connected networks.

Moreover, the WSD will continue to strengthen its response management for water supply incidents. This includes deploying sufficient water trucks to meet sudden demands in a short timeframe. The department has also updated its internal guidelines for the dissemination of information on emergency water mains repairs. The WSD has also enhanced communication with District Offices, District Council members, and the Care Teams by establishing instant messaging platforms for swift information sharing.

In recent years, the WSD has been actively promoting the digitalisation of water supply services, formulating and accelerating the implementation of smart water strategy. It is expected that management of water mains and response work will continue to improve through exploring and rolling out a series of digital projects in phases, the use of technology, timely resources allocation, organised projects management and collaboration with the community.

âThank you, President."
立法會四題：增加的士司機數目,2025-07-02 16:15,2025-07-02 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200356.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上陳家珮議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

有報道指出的士行業近年出現難以吸引新血入行的情況，隨着首批的士車隊於今年七月正式投入服務，將對的士司機有殷切需求。有意見認為優化運輸署的士筆試程序及考核內容能改善相關情況。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年每年的士筆試的報考人數，以及當中的及格人數和及格率為何；

（二）如何優化的士筆試乙部有關地方及路線試題的部分，以切合現時科技進步下的新駕駛常態；及

（三）有否計劃協助業界吸引新人入行；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直着力提升的士服務質素，在過去多年推出一系列措施，包括推出的士車隊、優化的士筆試、增加的士乘客座位數目上限、引入的士司機違例記分制度（記分制），以及放寬的士禁區上落客限制等等。這些措施的目的是讓乘客有更好的出行體驗、改善的士業的整體形象，以及促進行業長遠健康發展，從而形成良性循環，吸引更多新人投身的士業界。

就陳家珮議員的提問，我的回覆如下：

（一）的士筆試主要考核考生對的士營運規例、主要地點和路線，以及《道路使用者守則》等實務知識的掌握。運輸署於二○二○年二月優化的士筆試，更新考核內容和調整試題數目，以更集中考核關於的士服務的核心知識。有關措施成功吸引更多人報考的士筆試，應考人數在過去數年大幅增加四成，由二○一九年的不足10 000人增加至二○二四年的接近14 000人。另外，的士筆試的及格率亦由二○一九年的37%提升至二○二四年的60%。上述數字反映優化的士筆試對吸引新人投身的士司機行業有相當正面的作用。二○一九年至二○二四年的士筆試應考人數、及格人數和及格率載於附表。

（二）為了與時並進，讓的士筆試更能切合業界的實際運作需要，運輸署現正進一步全面檢討考核安排。

其中，考慮到現時的導航科技已能協助的士司機快速尋找目的地及規劃最佳行駛路線，運輸署會大幅減少和簡化的士筆試乙部有關地方和路線的試題，並更新試題庫，令考核更能切合實務需要，並同時確保通過考核的考生具備的士司機的專業知識和素養，且對主要道路網絡及常到的地點有基本認知和掌握。

除了因應科技應用而簡化乙部試題外，運輸署亦會加入新試題，以考核考生對提升的士服務質素的一系列新措施（例如的士車隊制度、記分制等）的認識。

運輸署現正密鑼緊鼓地進行相關檢視工作，並爭取於今年第四季實施經進一步優化的的士筆試。

（三）除了優化的士筆試外，政府已於二○二○年十月一日起放寬申請商用車輛（包括的士）駕駛執照的規限，由過往要求申請人必須持有有效私家車或輕型貨車的正式駕駛執照最少三年，縮短為最少一年，希望可以吸引更多新血入行。

另外，政府在去年推出的士車隊制度，鼓勵業界透過更專業和系統化的模式管理旗下的車隊和司機，提升的士服務水準以及整體的士行業的形象。運輸署於上星期已宣布會於七月內向五支車隊發出正式牌照。

在過去一段時間，五支車隊營辦商一直採取不同方法積極吸引新血和司機加入車隊。不同的士車隊營辦商先後參與勞工處的地區招聘會及專題招聘會，讓求職人士對車隊及其聘用模式有更深入的認識。各車隊亦透過不同措施吸引司機加入，包括提供新人介紹費和駕駛安全獎金等，以及引入彈性工作時間等安排。營辦商亦會為司機提供職前訓練，提升客戶服務技巧，並通過系統化管理，支援司機處理乘客查詢，為司機營造更佳的工作環境。據我們向各車隊營辦商了解，招聘會和各項措施吸引不少行外人士查詢，並成功招聘了超過40名新人加入車隊，而這工作會繼續，可見車隊制度對吸引新人入行有正面作用。

此外，僱員再培訓局亦有提供與的士司機相關的培訓課程，向有意入行的人士，講解行業的發展、駕駛安全及服務時需注意事項等，協助學員投身的士司機的工作。合資格人士更可獲學費資助或全額學費豁免。同時，部分的士車行亦有為有意考取的士駕駛執照的人士提供網上的士考牌課程，以及為新入行司機提供培訓計劃等，讓他們能夠更了解的士的日常營運。以上各項措施均有助吸引新人入行。

政府將繼續密切留意的士的營運和管理情況，並透過不同措施協助業界提升服務，促進行業的長遠健康發展。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Increasing number of taxi drivers,2025-07-02 16:15,2025-07-02 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200357.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Judy Chan and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

It has been reported that the taxi industry has faced difficulties in attracting new blood to join the industry in recent years, and, as the first batch of taxi fleets will officially commence service in July this year, there will be keen demand for taxi drivers. There are views that the situation can be rectified by optimising the procedure and content of the Taxi Written Test of the Transport Department. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of candidates sitting for the Taxi Written Test as well as the number of candidates who passed the test and the passing rate in each of the past five years;

(2) how the Location and Route Questions of Part B of the Taxi Written Test will be optimised to suit, in the context of driving, the new normal arising from the advancement of technology nowadays; and

(3) whether it has any plans to assist the industry in attracting newcomers to join the industry; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government has been striving to enhance the service quality of taxis, and has introduced a series of measures in the past years. Such measures include introducing a taxi fleet regime, enhancing the Taxi Written Test, increasing the maximum passenger seating capacity of taxis, introducing a Taxi-Driver-Offence Points (TDOP) system, and relaxing no-stopping restrictions for taxis at designated restricted zones. These measures are launched with a view to providing passengers with a better riding experience, enhancing the overall image of the taxi trade and promoting the healthy development of the taxi industry in the long run, thereby creating a virtuous cycle to attract more new blood to join the taxi industry.

Regarding the Hon Judy Chan's questions, my reply is as follows:

(1) The Taxi Written Test focuses on assessing candidates' practical knowledge on the guidelines and regulations related to taxi operation, key locations and routes, as well as the Road Users' Code. The Transport Department (TD) enhanced the Taxi Written Test in February 2020 by updating the test content and adjusting the number of questions, with a view to focusing more on the assessment of core knowledge regarding taxi services. Such measures successfully attract more people to apply for the Taxi Written Test. The number of candidates sitting the Test has increased significantly by 40 per cent in the past few years, from less than 10 000 candidates sitting the Test in 2019 to around 14 000 candidates in 2024. In addition, the passing rate of the Taxi Written Test rose from 37 per cent in 2019 to 60 per cent in 2024. The above figures show that the enhancement of the Taxi Written Test has a notably positive effect in attracting newcomers to join the taxi driver profession. The numbers of candidates who sat and passed the Taxi Written Test from 2019 to 2024 and the corresponding passing rates are set out at the Annex.

(2) To keep up with the times and better align the Taxi Written Test with the practical needs of the trade, the TD is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the arrangements of the Test.

In particular, having considered that modern navigation technology can now assist taxi drivers in quickly locating destinations and planning the most efficient driving routes, the TD will substantially reduce and simplify the questions on locations and routes under Part B of the Taxi Written Test and update the question bank, with a view to better aligning the Test with practical needs, and at the same time ensure that the candidates who pass the test possess the professional knowledge and qualities of taxi drivers, and have a basic understanding and grasp of the major road networks and frequently visited locations.

Besides simplifying the questions under Part B of the Test in the light of technological applications, the TD will also add new questions to assess candidates' knowledge of the series of new measures introduced to enhance taxi service quality (e.g. taxi fleet regime, the TDOP system).

The TD is now pressing ahead with the relevant work and aims to implement the further enhanced Taxi Written Test in the fourth quarter of this year.

(3) Apart from enhancing the Taxi Written Test, the Government has relaxed the eligibility requirements for commercial vehicle (including taxi) driving licences from October 1, 2020. The period required for an applicant to hold a valid private car or light goods vehicle full driving licence has been shortened from a minimum of three years to at least one year, with a view to attracting more new blood to join the industry.

Separately, the Government introduced the taxi fleet regime last year to encourage the trade to adopt a more professional and systematic approach to manage their fleets and drivers, in order to enhance the quality of taxi services and improve the overall image of the taxi industry. Last week, the TD announced that they would issue the official Taxi Fleet Licences to the five taxi fleets within July 2025.

Over the past period of time, the five fleet operators have been proactively implementing different measures to recruit new blood and existing drivers to join the fleet. Various taxi fleet operators have successively participated in the district and thematic job fairs organised by the Labour Department, enabling job seekers to gain a deeper understanding of the fleets and their recruitment model. The fleets have also implemented different measures to recruit taxi drivers, including offering new driver referral bonus and safe driving bonus, as well as providing flexible working hour arrangements. In addition, the operators will offer pre-service training to enhance drivers' customer service skills, and implement systematic management to support drivers in handling customer enquiries, creating a better working environment for fleet drivers. We understand from the fleet operators that the job fairs and various measures have attracted enquiries from job seekers outside the industry, and they have recruited more than 40 newcomers to join the fleet. These efforts will continue, demonstrating that the taxi fleet regime has a positive effect in attracting new blood to join the industry.

In addition, the Employees Retraining Board also offers taxi driver-related training courses to provide prospective drivers with information on the development of the industry, driving safety and matters to pay attention to when providing taxi services, thereby assisting them in joining the taxi driver profession. Eligible persons may even receive tuition subsidies or full course fee waivers. At the same time, certain taxi dealers are also offering online courses for those seeking to apply for taxi driver's licence, as well as training courses for individuals that are new to the industry, so that the newcomers can better understand the daily operation of the taxi industry. All these measures help attract new blood to the industry.

The Government will continue to closely monitor the operation and management of the taxi industry, and implement different measures to assist the trade to enhance their services, thereby promoting the healthy development of the taxi industry in the long run.

Thank you, President."

Question:

It is mentioned in the website of the Joint Office for Investigation of Water Seepage Complaints (JO) that ""under normal circumstances, seepage caused by the penetration of rainwater through roofs, flat roofs, balconies, external walls or windows of a building or from leaking water pipes will not have public health implications and is not nuisance actionable by the Regional Joint Office under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132)"". In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of requests for assistance relating to water seepage received by JO in each year since 2022 and, among them, the number of those in which the seepage was caused by the penetration of rainwater through roofs, flat roofs, balconies, external walls or windows of a building or from leaking water pipes, and thus could not be handled by JO;

(2) as there are views that JO currently carries out water seepage investigations by issuing nuisance notices or orders under Cap. 132, the scope of which is confined to the wilful damage to drains, cesspools, wells or nuisance to any sanitary convenience, but the existing mechanism fails to effectively address the predicament faced by members of the public who have long been suffering from water seepage caused by defective waterproofing layers on rooftops, whether the authorities will consider amending Cap. 132 to gradually include important water seepage problems (e.g. rooftop leakage) in the definition of ""nuisance"", so as to expand the enforcement responsibilities of JO, such that the affected members of the public will be provided with assistance; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) given that under section 34H of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) concerning the ""duty to maintain property"", ""where a person who owns any part of a building, has the right to the exclusive possession of any part of a building or has the exclusive right to the use, occupation or enjoyment of that part, as the case may be, but the deed of mutual covenant in respect of the building does not impose an obligation on that person to maintain the part in good repair and condition, that person shall maintain that part in good repair and condition"", whether the authorities will consider amending the relevant provisions to stipulate that all the owners or owners' corporations owe an obligation to undertake maintenance works to keep the property in ""good repair and condition"", and at the same time expanding the powers of JO to issue warnings to and impose penalties on defaulters; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Proper management and maintenance of private property is the responsibility of property owners. If water seepage occurs in private buildings, the owners concerned may first co-operate among themselves to engage professionals or consultancy firms for carrying out water seepage investigation to identify the source of seepage and conducting necessary repair works to fulfill owners’ responsibility of proper management, maintenance and repair of buildings. Consultancy firms or professionals are also available in the market to provide services for investigating and handling water seepage problems. A list of consultancy firms and experts providing professional advice and services on water seepage problems has been uploaded onto the websites of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and the Buildings Department (BD) for public reference. When the water seepage condition concerned has caused health nuisance, risk to structural safety of the building or water waste, the Government will take enforcement action in accordance with the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132) (PHMSO), the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123) (BO) and the Waterworks Ordinance (Cap. 102) respectively.

If owners are unable to resolve water seepage problems in consultation with their neighbours, they can seek assistance from the Joint Office (JO) jointly set up by the FEHD and the BD. Through inter-departmental co-ordination, the JO seeks to identify the source of water seepage using one-stop and systematic testing methods and requires the owners concerned to carry out repair works by exercising the powers conferred by the law, leveraging the expertise of relevant departments and with co-operation of the owners or occupants concerned.

Having consulted the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB), the FEHD and the Home Affairs Department, the replies to the various parts of the question are as follows:

(1) If the water seepage constitutes a health nuisance, the JO will follow up on the case in accordance with the PHMSO and take criminal prosecution action as appropriate. If rainwater seepage through rooftops, podiums, balconies, external walls or windows of buildings poses building safety risks (e.g. concrete spalling from ceilings, corrosion of reinforcement), or if the seepage is related to defective drainage pipes such as rainwater pipes or foul water pipes of the buildings, the JO will refer the case to the BD for action in accordance with the BO. If water supply pipes are found to be defective and resulting in wastage of water supply, the JO will refer the case to the Water Supplies Department (WSD) for action under the Waterworks Ordinance.

In 2022, 2023 and 2024, the number of complaints about water seepage in buildings received by the JO was 39 555, 45 033 and 47 299 respectively, of which 1 243, 1 436 and 2 200 were referred to the BD for cases relating to building safety risk caused by the seepage and involving defective drainage pipes respectively; and 702, 861 and 1 236 were referred to the WSD for cases relating to or suspected to be relating to water supply pipe leakage respectively. The JO does not maintain a breakdown of water seepage cases caused by rainwater but did not pose building safety risk.

(2) If the JO finds that the source of water seepage is a nuisance under the PHMSO, the JO will issue a Nuisance Notice to the owner of the premise with water seepage, irrespective of whether wilful damage to drains, bathroom floors, sanitary fitments, etc is involved.

For rooftop water seepage, the JO will refer the case to the BD under the aforementioned mechanism. Based on the investigation results, the BD will issue an advisory letter to the owner concerned to carry out water seepage investigations and follow-up actions as soon as possible. If the seepage is found to constitute building structural safety risk, the BD may issue a building repair order, an investigation order or a drainage repair order in accordance with the BO as appropriate. With regard to defective buildings or drains, a person is liable to an offence for failing to comply with a statutory order served under the law to carry out remedial works.

Since the aforesaid mechanism for handling rooftop water seepage has been serving its purpose, the EEB considers that currently it is not necessary to amend the PHMSO.

(3) Under the existing Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (BMO), if owners have formed an owners’ corporation (OC) in accordance with the BMO, the OC will act legally on behalf of all owners in managing and maintaining the common parts of the building and shall take all reasonably necessary measures to discharge its responsibilities relating to the control, management and administration of the building as set out in the deed of mutual covenant; if a building does not have an OC, the responsibility for the management of the common parts of the building would be shared by all owners. OCs or owners may consider appointing a property management company with a licence issued by the Property Management Services Authority under the Property Management Services Ordinance (Cap. 626) to assist in the work relating to building management.

The Public Health and Municipal Services (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 (the Amendment Ordinance) was passed by the Legislative Council and will come into operation on August 17, 2025. To expedite the handling of public health nuisances such as water seepage in buildings, the Amendment Ordinance will extend the hours during which public officers are allowed to enter premises from the existing 7am to 7pm to 7am to 10pm, and non-compliance with the Notice of Intended Entry will be an offence punishable by a fine up to level 2 (i.e. $5,000). To enhance the deterrent effect, the penalty for non-compliance with Nuisance Notices and Orders will be increased from a fine at Level 3 to Level 4 (i.e. $10,000 to $25,000) and from a fine at Level 4 to a fine at Level 5 (i.e. $25,000 to $50,000)."
​立法會十四題：滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處,2025-07-02 16:00,2025-07-02 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200455.htm,"​以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上陳健波議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處（滲水辦）的網站提及，「在正常情況下，由天雨經大廈天台、平台、露台、外牆或窗戶所引致的滲漏，以及供水喉管破損引致滲水不會構成公眾衞生的問題，也不是聯合辦公室可引用《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章）提出起訴的妨擾」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）二○二二年至今，每年滲水辦接獲多少宗有關滲水的求助個案，當中有多少宗個案是由天雨經大廈天台、平台、露台、外牆或窗戶所引致的滲漏，或供水喉管破損引致滲水，因而滲水辦不能處理的個案；

（二）鑑於有意見認為目前滲水辦進行的滲水調查是依從第132章發出妨擾事故通知或命令，其範圍限定於故意損害排水渠、污水池、水井或對任何衞生設施構成妨擾，但針對市民長期受天台防水層失修導致的滲水問題，現行機制未能有效解決他們面對的困境，當局會否考慮修訂第132章，逐步將重要的滲水問題（例如天台滲漏）納入「妨擾」的定義內，以擴大滲水辦的執法範圍，令受影響市民得到協助；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於根據《建築物管理條例》（第344章）第34H條有關「維持物業的職責」的規定，「凡擁有建築物任何部分的人，或對建築物任何部分具有獨有管有權的人，或對該部分具有獨有的使用、佔用或享用權的人（視屬何情況而定），雖則該建築物的公契並無對該人施加維持該部分修葺妥善及狀況良好的責任，該人亦須維持該部分修葺妥善及狀況良好」，當局會否考慮修改相關條文，指名所有業主或業主立案法團負起維持「修葺妥善及狀況良好」的維修工程，同時擴大滲水辦的權力，對失責者施加警告及罰則；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

妥善管理和維修私人物業是業主應盡的責任。若私人物業出現滲水情況，有關業主一般應先透過相互溝通合作，委聘專業人士／顧問公司進行滲水調查及查找滲水源頭，並進行所需的維修，以履行業主妥善管理和維修保養樓宇的責任。市場上亦有顧問公司或專業人士提供調查及處理滲水問題的服務。食物環境衞生署（食環署）及屋宇署的網頁上載了就滲水問題提供專業意見和服務的顧問公司及專家名單，供市民參考。如有關滲水情況構成衞生妨擾、樓宇結構安全風險或浪費供水，政府可分別根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章）、《建築物條例》（第123章）及《水務設施條例》（第102章）執法。

如業主未能與鄰居協商解決滲水問題，可向由食環署及屋宇署合組的聯合辦事處（聯辦處）尋求協助。聯辦處會以跨部門合作模式，透過法例賦予的權力和相關部門的專業知識，配合有關業主或住戶的合作，以一站式及有系統的測試方法，嘗試找出滲水的源頭，再飭令有關業主進行維修。

經諮詢環境及生態局、食環署和民政事務總署後，就提問的各部分，現分別回覆如下：

（一）如滲水情況構成衞生妨擾，聯辦處會根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》作出跟進，並視乎情況作刑事檢控。如天雨經大廈天台、平台、露台、外牆或窗戶引致的滲漏對樓宇安全構成風險（例如天花混凝土剝落、鋼筋銹蝕等），或滲漏與樓宇的雨水渠管或髒水渠管等排水渠管失修有關，聯辦處會將個案轉介屋宇署根據《建築物條例》處理。若發現供水喉管失修而引致浪費供水的情況，聯辦處會轉介水務署根據《水務設施條例》處理。

在二○二二年、二○二三年和二○二四年，聯辦處接獲的樓宇滲水投訴個案分別為39 555宗、45 033宗和47 299宗，其中因滲漏情況對樓宇安全構成風險和涉及排水渠管失修而轉介屋宇署的個案分別為1 243宗、1 436宗和2 200宗；因涉及或懷疑供水喉管滲漏而須轉介水務署的個案分別為702宗、861宗和1 236宗。聯辦處沒有備存當中因天雨引致滲水但未有對樓宇安全構成風險的分項數字。

（二）聯辦處若發現滲水源頭是屬於《公眾衞生及市政條例》列明的妨擾事故，則不論是否涉及故意損害排水渠、浴室地台、衞生設施等，均會向滲水單位業主發出妨擾事故通知。

就天台出現滲漏，聯辦處會根據上述機制將個案轉介予屋宇署。屋宇署會按調查結果向相關業主發出勸喻信，盡快進行滲水調查及跟進工程；若發現滲漏構成樓宇結構安全風險，則可按情況根據《建築物條例》發出樓宇修葺令、勘測令或渠務修葺令。就欠妥建築物或排水渠而言，任何人如沒有遵從根據法例送達的法定命令進行補救工程，即屬違法。

考慮到上述處理天台滲漏的機制亦發揮其作用，環境及生態局認為現階段沒有需要對《公眾衞生及市政條例》作出修訂。

（三）根據現行《建築物管理條例》（第344章）的規定，如業主已根據《建築物管理條例》成立業主立案法團（法團），法團在法律上會代表所有業主管理和維修建築物的公用部分，並須採取一切合理必需的措施，以執行公契載明有關建築物的控制、管理、行政事宜的責任；如大廈沒有法團，大廈公用部分的管理責任則由所有業主共同承擔。法團或業主可考慮委聘由物業管理業監管局根據《物業管理服務條例》（第626章）發出牌照的持牌物業管理公司，協助處理大廈管理的相關工作。

《2025年公眾衞生及市政（修訂）條例》（《修訂條例》）已獲立法會通過，並將於二○二五年八月十七日生效。為加快處理樓宇滲水等公共衞生妨擾問題，《修訂條例》將容許公職人員進入處所的時段由目前上午七時至下午七時，延長至上午七時至下午十時；而不遵從「擬進入處所通知書」將屬違法並可處以最高第二級罰款（即5,000元）。為加強阻嚇力，不遵從妨擾事故通知和命令的罰則，將由第三級罰款調高至第四級罰款（即10,000元調高至25,000元），以及由第四級罰款調高至第五級罰款（即25,000元調高至50,000元）。"

問題：

據報近年來國家持續擴大免簽證（免簽）範圍，除了單方面新增47個免簽國家外，可過境免簽的國家更達55個，便利海外旅客到內地旅遊。就香港而言，中央政府於去年三月及五月新增十個內地赴港「個人遊」城市（該等城市），並於十二月恢復及擴展深圳市居民以「一簽多行」個人遊簽注來港。就吸引內地和海外居民訪港，政府可否告知本會：

（一）去年六月至今，每月（i）經香港入境內地的海外旅客人數、（ii）由內地經香港出境的海外旅客人數、（iii）該等旅客的平均留港日數，以及（iv）其所屬國籍（即首十個訪港人數最多的國籍）；

（二）就國家放寬海外旅客過境免簽政策，將境內停留時間延展為240小時，當局有否向中央政府爭取將香港各個口岸納入為上述國策的適用口岸，以進一步發揮香港作為旅遊城市樞紐的功能，從而吸引更多海外旅客經香港進出內地，並在香港旅遊和消費；

（三）去年五月至本年五月期間，該等城市每月的訪港旅客人數和其留港的平均日數分別為何；

（四）當局有何措施（包括宣傳推廣計劃、鼓勵航空公司增加來往香港和該等城市的航班，以及推動香港和該等城市的同業合作）吸引更多該等城市的旅客來港；

（五）自去年十二月恢復並擴展深圳居民「一簽多行」安排以來，深圳市戶籍居民及持居住證的深圳市非戶籍居民每月到港的人數和其留港的平均日數分別為何；及

（六）當局有否向中央政府商討和爭取開放廣州、北京和上海居民可以「一簽多行」個人遊簽注來港，以促進商貿往來，並吸引更多過夜旅客訪港；如有，詳情及商討結果為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

香港特區政府感謝中央政府高度重視及關顧香港旅遊業的發展，在二○二四年推出了多項惠及香港旅遊業的措施，包括優化「個人遊」計劃，使「個人遊」計劃涵蓋全國所有省會城市，以及恢復和擴展深圳市「一簽多行」個人遊簽注安排。特區政府會繼續用好中央政府的惠港措施，鞏固內地客源市場，亦會與內地探討如何便利國際旅客通過香港入境內地的安排，以鞏固香港作為國家的國際門戶角色。

香港一直是海外旅客進入內地的門戶，是連接內地和全球的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」。文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）一直致力強化香港作爲國際旅遊城市樞紐的定位，密切留意國家推出的過境免簽政策，並在現有廣東省「144小時便簽」政策的基礎上，持續與相關中央部委商討便利海外旅客通過香港入境內地的政策安排，以吸引更多海外旅客以香港作爲他們在國家「一程多站」旅途中的首站或中轉站，發揮好香港的紐帶角色。

入境處並沒有備存上述旅客的平均留港日數的資料。根據旅發局的資料，在二○二四年五月至二○二五年五月入境香港的內地旅客，過夜及非過夜旅客分別有1 611萬和2 194萬人次，過夜的內地旅客的平均留港日數分別為3.1日。

為吸引更多十市居民訪港，文體旅局聯同旅發局推出了一系列宣傳工作。在二○二四年三月「個人遊」計劃擴展至西安市和青島市後，文體旅局與旅發局率團訪問兩地，並於當地商圈推出大型廣告，總曝光為2 380萬人次。在「個人遊」計劃進一步擴展至所有省會城市後，旅發局在二○二四年六月邀請太原、呼和浩特、哈爾濱等八個新增「個人遊」城市業界代表來港考察，深度探索香港地道文化。

旅發局亦自二○二四年四月起通過旅行社與航空公司向新增的「個人遊」十市旅客派發逾四萬份、每份價值港幣200元的「自在啟程，優遊香港」優惠券，促進旅客來港消費。

此外，運物局一直與香港機場管理局（機管局）緊密合作，策略性地透過外展隊、獎勵計劃及政策便利措施等，吸引本地及非本地的航空公司開拓新的航點和增加航班，進一步加強香港和內地城市的航空連繫。其中，機管局於去年六月推出了航空網絡拓展計劃，至今已吸引29間航空公司開通60條新航線，並增加了14個航點的班次，包括西安、青島、拉薩、蘭州及烏魯木齊的客運航班。現時，往來內地及香港的客運航班服務已全面覆蓋去年新增的「個人遊」十市。相較於「個人遊」計劃擴大之前，往來十市的航班服務整體增幅達八成。

在推動業界協作方面，文體旅局透過向香港旅遊業議會撥款，先後於二○二五年二月和六月組織業界前往哈爾濱市和太原市，並將於二○二五年十月到訪西安市考察，與當地文化旅遊部門及行業商會代表進行業務交流，推動香港與當地旅遊業界的業務合作，促進客源互送及開拓市場商機。

就有序優化「個人遊」計劃的建議，包括將「一簽多行」措施擴展至其他內地城市，文體旅局會繼續與內地相關部委討論，以期為內地旅客提供更便捷靈活的方式訪港，促進旅遊相關行業的蓬勃發展。"

It has been reported that in recent years, our country has continued to expand the scope of its visa-free policy by, apart from expanding its unilateral visa-free policy to 47 countries, implementing a visa-free transit policy for 55 countries, thereby facilitating overseas visitors' travel to the Mainland. For Hong Kong, the Central Government added 10 Mainland cities (such cities) eligible for travelling to Hong Kong under the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) in March and May last year, and resumed and expanded the multiple-entry IVS for Shenzhen residents to visit Hong Kong in December. Regarding efforts to attract Mainland and overseas residents to visit Hong Kong, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of, each month since June last year, (i) the number of overseas travelers entering the Mainland via Hong Kong, (ii) the number of overseas travelers leaving the Mainland via Hong Kong, (iii) such travelers' average length of stay in Hong Kong, and (iv) their nationalities (i.e. the top 10 nationalities with the highest number of visitors);

(2) in light of our country's relaxation of its visa-free transit policy for overseas travelers and extension of their maximum stay on the Mainland to 240 hours, whether the authorities have sought from the Central Government the inclusion of all Hong Kong checkpoints into the scope of the aforesaid national policy to further enhance Hong Kong's role as a tourism hub, thereby attracting more overseas travelers to enter and leave the Mainland via Hong Kong, and to travel around and consume in Hong Kong;

(3) of the monthly number of visitors from such cities to Hong Kong and their average length of stay in Hong Kong during the period from May last year to May this year;

(4) of the measures taken by the authorities (including publicity and promotional campaigns, encouraging airlines to increase flights between Hong Kong and such cities, and promoting co-operation between the tourism industries of Hong Kong and such cities) to attract more visitors from such cities to Hong Kong;

(5) since the resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry IVS for Shenzhen residents in December last year, of the monthly number of Shenzhen permanent residents and Shenzhen non-permanent residents holding residence permits visiting Hong Kong and their average length of stay in Hong Kong; and

(6) whether the authorities has discussed with the Central Government and sought to open up the multiple-entry IVS for residents of Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai to visit Hong Kong, with the aim of promoting trade and business exchanges and attracting more overnight visitors to Hong Kong; if so, of the details and the results of the discussions; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (HKSARG) expressed gratitude to the Central Government for the high regard and care for the development of Hong Kong's tourism industry as well as rolling out a number of measures benefiting Hong Kong's tourism industry in 2024, including the optimisation of the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) to cover all provincial capitals in our country, and the resumption and expansion of the multiple-entry IVS for Shenzhen. The HKSARG will continue to make good use of the Central Government's measures benefitting Hong Kong to reinforce the Mainland visitor source market, and continue to liaise with the Mainland on facilitating international visitors' entry arrangements to the Mainland via Hong Kong, thereby underpinning Hong Kong's role as the international gateway to our country.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB), the Security Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), the consolidated reply to the question raised by Hon Yiu Pak-leung is as follows:

(1) and (2) According to the statistics provided by the ImmD, from June 2024 to May 2025, the number of overseas visitor arrivals entering and leaving the Mainland via Hong Kong is tabulated below by month:

Hong Kong has long been the gateway for overseas visitors to enter the Mainland, as well as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" linking up the Mainland with the rest of the world. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) has been committed to strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international tourism hub, and has been closely monitoring the visa-free policies introduced by our country. The CSTB will, on the basis of the existing 144-hour visa-free policy for Guangdong province, continue to discuss with the relevant ministries of the Central Government the arrangements to facilitate international visitors to enter the Mainland via Hong Kong, with a view to attracting more international visitors to take Hong Kong as their first stop or transit point in their multi-destination travel itineraries to our country, leveraging Hong Kong's role as a connector.

(3) to (6) The The IVS was expanded to Xi'an and Qingdao on March 6, 2024, and further expanded to Taiyuan, Hohhot, Harbin, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Xining, Yinchuan and Urumqi on May 27, 2024. For the period from May 2024 to May 2025, the number of Mainland visitor arrivals from the aforesaid 10 newly added cities is tabulated below by month:

The ImmD does not maintain information on the average length of stay of the above visitors in Hong Kong. According to the information provided by the HKTB, of the inbound Mainland visitors from May 2024 to May 2025, overnight visitors and same-day visitors were 16.11 million and 21.94 million respectively, and the average length of stay of overnight Mainland visitors in Hong Kong was 3.1 days.

To attract more residents from the 10 cities to visit Hong Kong, the CSTB, in collaboration with the HKTB, have rolled out a series of promotional activities. After the expansion of the IVS to Xi'an and Qingdao in March 2024, the CSTB and the HKTB led a delegation to visit the two cities, and launched large-scale advertisements in local commercial districts, achieving a total exposure of 23.8 million views. After the expansion of the IVS to all provincial capitals, trade representatives from the eight newly added IVS cities, including Taiyuan, Hohhot, Harbin and others, were invited for a familiarisation trip to Hong Kong in June 2024 to have an in-depth exploration of Hong Kong's local culture.

Starting from April 2024, the HKTB has distributed over 40 000 sets of discount vouchers, each valued at HK$200, to visitors from the 10 newly added IVS cities through travel agents and airlines, stimulating visitor spending in Hong Kong.

Moreover, the TLB has been working closely with the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA) to strategically attract both local and non-local airlines to open new routes and increase flight frequencies through outreach teams, incentive schemes and policy facilitation measures, thereby further strengthening the air connectivity between Hong Kong and Mainland cities. Notably, the AA launched in June last year the Air Network Development Programme, which has so far attracted 29 airlines to open 60 new routes and increase flight frequencies to 14 destinations, including passenger flights to Xi'an, Qingdao, Lhasa, Lanzhou, and Urumqi. The current passenger flight services between the Mainland and Hong Kong have completely covered the 10 newly added the IVS cities last year. Compared to the period before the expansion of the IVS, the total number of flights to and from these cities has increased by 80 per cent.

Regarding the promotion of trade collaboration, the CSTB provided funding support to the Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong to organise trade visits to Harbin and Taiyuan in February and June 2025 respectively and will visit Xi'an in October 2025. Through business exchanges with the representatives from the cultural and tourism departments and trade organisations of those cities, we foster business co-operation between the tourism trade of Hong Kong and those cities, facilitating exchange of visitors and developing business opportunities.

In terms of suggestions to orderly optimise the IVS, namely the expansion of the multiple-entry IVS to other Mainland cities, the CSTB will continue to discuss with relevant ministries of the Mainland, with a view to enabling Mainland visitors to visit Hong Kong in a more convenient and flexible manner, thereby fostering the development of the tourism-related industries."

LCQ10: Combating abuse of public welfare and public housing,2025-07-02 15:45,2025-07-02 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200301.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Steven Ho and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Housing, Mr Victor Tai,in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

  Under the existing system, applicants of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) Scheme (excluding the Guangdong Scheme and the Fujian Scheme) and the Social Security Allowance (SSA) Scheme must satisfy the residence requirements and the permissible limits of absence from Hong Kong (absence limits). In addition, tenants of public rental housing (PRH) must continuously reside in the units. However, it is learnt that some people are still enjoying benefits such as old age allowances and PRH despite residing abroad. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that while the Social Welfare Department only uses identity card numbers to verify CSSA and SSA recipients' travel records with the Immigration Department (ImmD), some people enter and exit Hong Kong with their passports in order to circumvent checks against the absence limits, taking advantage of the loophole in the absence of connection between travel records based on identity cards and those based on passports, whether the Government has investigated the veracity of the aforesaid situation; whether the Government has assessed the annual loss of public money arising from this loophole, and whether it has enhanced the verification mechanism to plug the loophole; if it has enhanced the verification mechanism, of the details (including the effectiveness of the enhanced mechanism); if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the Government has considered using biometric features (e.g. fingerprint and face) as the only proof of identification for travel records, so as to prevent individuals from taking advantage of the loophole in travel records mentioned in (1) to conceal the fact that they reside abroad; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) given that the Office of The Ombudsman mentioned a number of cases of ""not retaining regular and continuous residence in the flats"" in its report dated January this year on the direct investigation operation into the Government's work in combating abuse of public housing resources, what specific mechanisms it has currently put in place to monitor and prevent abuse of PRH by individuals residing abroad, and how the effectiveness of such mechanisms is assessed; as regards tenants who deliberately conceal their residence abroad in order to keep their PRH flats, what other legal measures the Government has put in place, apart from demanding surrender of the flats, to bring them to account, and whether it has assessed if such measures have sufficient deterrent effect; and

(4) given that all the principal tenants and household members in the multiple cases of ""not retaining regular and continuous residence in the flats"" mentioned in (3) reside outside Hong Kong, whether the Government has examined the reasons for not being able to uncover their abuse of PRH in time through their travel records back then; in order to combat abuse of PRH by tenants residing abroad, whether the Government has explored setting up an cross-departmental cooperation mechanism for the Housing Department, the Hong Kong Housing Society and ImmD to carry out data sharing, so as to enhance the procedure for accessing the records of PRH residents' stay in Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

  In response to the question raised by Hon Steven Ho, in consultation with the Security Bureau and the Labour and Welfare Bureau, our reply is as follows:

(1) Applicants and recipients of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA) or the Social Security Allowance must meet the relevant residence requirements and other eligibility criteria, and are required to declare all travel documents and provide other relevant information to the Social Welfare Department (SWD). If applicants and recipients fail to provide all relevant documents or information truthfully, once such cases are found, the SWD will take follow-up actions and may refer the cases to the law enforcement department for handling if necessary. It is a criminal offence for an applicant and a recipient to deliberately provide false information or omit information in order to obtain cash assistance by deception. In addition to becoming ineligible for cash assistance, the applicant and the recipient may be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a maximum of 14 years under the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210 of the Laws of Hong Kong).

  Besides, in accordance with the existing established mechanism, the Immigration Department (ImmD) provides, on a regular basis or upon request by the SWD, the travel records of applicants and recipients, including the travel records of these persons using their Hong Kong identity card, travel document issued by ImmD (including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports) and travel document issued by other countries/territories, to the SWD for verification of the compliance with the relevant residence requirements of the persons concerned.

(2) Section 5 of the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115) stipulates that individuals entering or leaving Hong Kong at immigration control points must present a valid travel document. When entering into or exiting from Hong Kong, Hong Kong residents may use their Hong Kong identity card or a valid travel document to complete immigration clearance at traditional counters at control points. Eligible holders of smart identity card may also use their smart identity cards or encrypted QR codes, together with fingerprint or facial recognition technology, for self-service immigration clearance at e-Channels.

  To implement effective immigration control, the ImmD adopts biometric recognition technologies (such as fingerprints and facial images) in its immigration control operations to verify the identity of individuals using Hong Kong identity card or travel document for entry into or exit from Hong Kong.

  Under the existing established mechanism, the immigration records of relevant individuals provided by the ImmD to the SWD and the Housing Department (HD) have already encompassed information related to Hong Kong identity cards, travel documents issued by the ImmD (including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports), and travel documents issued by other countries or regions. The information provided would facilitate verification by the relevant departments of whether the recipients continue to meet the eligibility criteria for receiving relevant social welfare benefits.

(3) and (4) The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has adopted multi-pronged approach to combat tenancy abuse of public rental housing (PRH). HD has all along addressed the issue of tenancy abuse through various means including daily estate management, routine home visits, random checks and in-depth investigations of suspected cases, as well as publicity and education. These efforts aim to reduce the chance of tenancy abuse of PRH, thereby expediting turnover of PRH flats and allowing those in genuine need of housing to move into PRH as soon as possible.

  To ensure the optimal use of PRH resources, the HD has established a regular mechanism with Immd, under which Immd regularly reports the death records of PRH tenants to the HD so that the HD can proactively monitor tenants' occupancy status and take appropriate actions. The Immd also provides travel records of relevant individuals (such as PRH principal tenants and household members) upon request by the HD, with a view to enabling the HD to verify whether the individuals concerned continue to meet the eligibility criteria for residing in PRH.

  To strengthen the monitoring, the HD has set up a new computer system to store case information about tenancy abuse, including the processes and investigation results. Estate management staff also conducts unannounced home visits outside office hours. Investigations will be initiated, if there are suspected cases of PRH abuse or upon receipt of reports from the public on suspected cases of PRH abuse. The HD also selects cases on a random basis for in-depth investigation.

  In addition, to expedite the verification of occupancy status of tenancy abuse cases and enforcement actions, the HD liaises with other government departments to obtain key information in accordance with relevant ordinances and regulations (such as enquiry with the ImmD about the immigration records of tenants who are suspected of not retaining regular and continuous residence, enquiry with the Water Supplies Department about households with unusual water consumption, etc) so as to verify cases of tenancy abuse and accelerate the handling of such cases.

  In fact, since 2023, the HA has rolled out a series of new measures to strengthen efforts to combat tenancy abuse of PRH. Starting from October 2023, the HA requires all PRH households to declare their occupancy status and ownership of domestic property in Hong Kong every two years since admission to PRH. They are required to declare whether they have retained continuous residence in their units, and whether the units have been left vacant or used for unauthorised purposes. If households have made false statement, the HA will consider terminating the tenancy agreement. The family member(s) who has made false statement will be subject to the restrictions of a five-year debarment from applying for PRH, no offer of a PRH flat with better quality, and even prosecution. Since the introduction of the measures, some PRH tenants were sentenced to imprisonment of 30 days by the court, and some tenants have voluntarily returned their units. The HA is confident that these measures will continue to strengthen its efforts against tenancy abuse of PRH.

  To collect intelligence for better targeting in combating PRH abuse, the HA launched the ""Report Public Housing Abuse Award"" (the Award) in January 2025. Since the launch of the Award, as at end March 2025, out of the total reported cases of around 3 900, about 1 700 cases have opted for participating in the Award. After initial screening, about 1 200 reported cases were eligible for joining the Award, and about 700 of them can be further followed up. There are cases where Notice-To-Quit were successfully issued. The first round of the Award presentation will be held in July 2025. The above demonstrated that the public has established a strong consensus to combat PRH tenancy abuse and to collectively safeguard the precious housing resources.

  In order to cope with the extra workload brought by the enhanced efforts in combating PRH abuse, in recent years, the HA has strengthened its collaboration with various government departments and has adopted different strategies and manpower deployment as appropriate in light of changing circumstances. This includes recruiting retired disciplined services officers to join the HD. From July 2022 to May 2025, over 8 700 PRH flats were recovered by the HA in view of tenancy abuse or breach of tenancy agreement. Compared to the recovery of about 1 400 flats in 2021/22, the average annual number of PRH flats recovered due to tenancy abuse and breach of tenancy agreement from 2022/23 to 2024/25 has more than doubled. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the strengthened measures implemented by the HA.

  To strengthen the intensity of combating PRH abuse and enhance the deterrent effect, the Housing Bureau has submitted the Housing (Amendment) Bill 2025 (the Bill) to the Legislative Council, and the Bill was passed on June 11, 2025. The Bill mainly includes three aspects: (i) introducing new offenses of serious tenancy abuse of PRH flats; (ii) empowering authorised officers to demand personal details from suspects; and (iii) extending the limitation of time for prosecution of offences of false statements, refusal to furnish information and unlawful alienations, thereby making measures against PRH abuse more deterrent. The relevant offenses will take effect from March 31, 2026. The HA will step up publicity efforts to ensure that the public fully understands and is aware of the consequences of violating the law.

  The HA/HD will continue to review the existing measures, including enhancing the investigation workflows and strengthening staff training, publicity and public education. We will also keep reviewing our strategies in combating PRH abuse and strengthening collaboration with other departments to safeguard the rational use of PRH resources.

  The Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) has also been adopting a multi-pronged approach in combating abuse of PRH resources holistically, including conducting home visits on a regular basis and prioritising investigation of suspected cases of non-occupation (such as those with relatively low water and electricity consumption, backlog of uncollected notices and letters in mailboxes for a prolonged period, etc). In addition, the HKHS has regularised conducting home visits during non-office hours and strengthened training for frontline staff to further enhance their awareness of and sensitivity to breaches of tenancy agreements. In addition, HKHS leverages smart technology to step up its efforts in combating PRH tenancy abuse, such as the in-house development of ""eHome Visit"". This digital platform digitises tenant information and home visit records to facilitate comparison, thereby allowing frontline staff to have a full picture during home visits and enabling prompt identification of suspicious cases. The HKHS will continue to keep pace with the times and regularly review the effectiveness of these measures, with additional initiatives introduced as and when necessary with a view to further enhancing the efficiency of home visits and the effectiveness of investigation of PRH tenancy abuse cases.

  The HKHS and the HA have maintained close communication and exchange on the efforts in combating abuse of PRH resources, and review and assess the effectiveness of the relevant measures from time to time. When tenants are suspected of not retaining regular and continuous residence in their units, the HKHS will request resident information such as travel records from ImmD depending on individual circumstances and investigation needs. Separately, the HKHS has since October 2005 established a notification mechanism with the ImmD on death records. Under this mechanism, the ImmD provides on a monthly basis records of persons who reside in rental estates of the HKHS yet with death registered in Hong Kong for the HKHS's suitable follow-up actions. The HKHS will continue to strengthen its communication with the ImmD to help enhance the effectiveness of investigations on PRH tenancy abuse."
立法會：署理商經局局長就恢復二讀辯論《2025年進出口（修訂）條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-07-02 15:45,2025-07-02 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200540.htm,"以下是署理商務及經濟發展局（商經局）局長陳百里博士今日（七月二日）在立法會會議就恢復二讀辯論《2025年進出口（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）的發言全文︰

代主席：

我衷心感謝《2025年進出口（修訂）條例草案》委員會主席黃英豪議員，以及其他四位委員的努力，令《條例草案》的審議工作得以高效、順利完成。我亦感謝剛才發言的幾位議員提出的寶貴意見及大家對《條例草案》的支持。

正如政府在動議二讀《條例草案》時提到，政府正全力推進實施「貿易單一窗口」（「單一窗口」）的工作，目標是在明年開始分批推出最後及最為複雜的第三階段服務，讓「單一窗口」取代現有的「政府電子貿易服務」系統，成為提交進出口報關單、貨物艙單，以及提交產地來源證與應課稅品許可證申請的唯一電子平台。《條例草案》亦會引入增值服務提供者及其規管框架、容許業界以自願性質在付運前提交進出口報關單及貨物艙單、引入電子道路貨物艙單及電子回證服務、就「單一窗口」的收費提供基本法律框架，以及加入過渡安排的條文，容許「單一窗口」第三階段與「政府電子貿易服務」並行一段時間，讓業界有足夠時間適應並過渡至新系統。

我們留意到，法案委員會在審議《條例草案》時較關注以下幾方面的事宜，我們亦在審議過程中作出了詳細回應。

第一，有關「單一窗口」的收費安排。在「單一窗口」第三階段，我們會按照政府的一貫政策訂定收費水平，即除非另有理據，收費水平一般應訂於足以收回在「單一窗口」下提交文件的相關成本。我們會檢視「單一窗口」的相關營運成本，精簡程序和人手，嚴格控制成本和開支，務求將日後的收費維持在合理水平。另外，我們亦會在「單一窗口」第三階段考慮提供誘因，例如較優惠的收費，鼓勵業界自願在貨物付運前提交進出口報關單及貨物艙單。

第二，有關「單一窗口」與其他系統連接的可行性。第三階段的資訊科技系統將具有相關的技術能力與其他經濟體的單一窗口或商業系統連接。就此，國家海關總署與商經局剛於今年五月簽署《「單一窗口」的合作安排》，以進一步加強內地與香港在「單一窗口」方面的合作和交流，推進兩地系統對接。我們亦正與東南亞國家聯盟展開討論，探討連接其單一窗口的可行性，務求進一步方便業界。另外，「單一窗口」第三階段將會與香港金融管理局的「商業數據通」合作，在獲得用戶的授權下，可透過「單一窗口」分享用戶的進出口報關數據予參與銀行，協助銀行審批用戶的信貸申請。商經局亦正與運輸及物流局積極探討「單一窗口」第三階段與港口社區系統合作的可行性，以期發揮兩個系統的協同效應，為貿易和物流業界創造更高效、更便捷的運作環境。

第三，有關資訊科技系統保安方面。政府一直非常重視這方面的工作。在開發「單一窗口」的過程中，我們已按照政府資訊科技保安的相關政策及指引，在系統設計層面引入了保安概念，確保資訊系統和應用程式在系統發展周期已經能夠符合相關的保安和資料保障要求。系統採用多層防禦和保護裝置及措施，以防止網路攻擊或未經授權的資料存取。在推出服務前，我們亦會進行一系列的系統測試（包括用戶驗收測試、負載測試、壓力測試、可靠性測試、應變能力測試等）、保安風險評估和審核，並會進行由數字政策辦公室安排的額外測試，以評估系統應對異常或極端負載和壓力情況，以及網絡攻擊風險的恢復能力，確保系統符合政府資訊安全方面的要求。我們亦會計劃不同應變措施，以處理任何突發情況。此外，商經局亦定期主持跨部門會議，與各個相關部門、數字政策辦公室及承辦商，共同監察系統開發過程，並就一些需要各部門參與和配合的地方作出討論。

第四，有關現時「政府電子貿易服務」的三間服務供應商日後角色方面。我們會預留足夠空間，讓商業機構發展多元化的增值服務。在第三階段推出後，商業機構可申請成為增值服務提供者，以代表貿易商提交及核實貿易文件和貨物資料、繳費等。屆時，業界可自由選擇直接在「單一窗口」系統遞交貿易文件或貨物資料，或委託增值服務提供者代其遞交。

最後，有議員關注宣傳及培訓方面的工作。在「單一窗口」第三階段實施前的一段時間內，香港海關會推出一系列宣傳、推廣及培訓計劃，以及支援服務，以協助業界更容易適應和使用「單一窗口」。

此外，政府參考了法案委員會和法律顧問的意見後，將會提出若干行文及技術修訂，讓法律條文更為清晰易明，更準確地反映立法原意。我稍後會在全體委員會審議階段提出修正案，並說明有關內容。

我留意到剛才幾位議員提及如何利用「單一窗口」的數據以協助業界發展業務。現時政府統計處會根據進出口報關單和貨物艙單的資料，分別編製香港對外商品貿易統計數字及船務統計數字，並定期發布有關數據。業界亦可使用政府統計處的互動數據發布服務，透過方便易用的介面，按照業務需要自行製作統計表或統計圖，並可下載作進一步處理和分析。

此外，正如我剛才提及，商經局正與多個政府部門及機構合作，商討如何在獲得用戶的授權下，將在不同系統內的數據進行分享，以期發揮系統之間的協同效應，為貿易和物流業界創造更高效、更便捷的運作環境。

另外，剛才有議員提及香港在推行「單一窗口」或貿易文件電子化方面似乎比某些經濟體慢。其實香港自一九九七年起已推出「政府電子貿易服務」，方便業界向政府提交常用的貿易文件。事實上，每個地方的進出口制度及規管要求不盡相同，其單一窗口提供的服務範圍亦不相同，因此難以比較各自推行單一窗口所需的時間。我們推展「單一窗口」的目的是便利業界向政府提供報關和清關所需的貿易文件，有助維持香港作為重要國際貿易中心和物流樞紐的地位。為了盡快讓業界使用「單一窗口」服務，我們採用分階段方式落實「單一窗口」。

我們一直就不同方案諮詢業界，以理順業務流程及設計最符合業界需要的資訊科技系統。我們明白業界對盡快推出「單一窗口」的訴求，我們亦正全力推展系統開發的工作。

另外，剛才有議員提及要盡快強制實施道路貨物艙單電子化。在推出「單一窗口」第三階段的初期，我們會讓業界自行選擇透過「單一窗口」或使用紙張提交道路貨物艙單，以便用家能夠順利過渡。我們將在適當時候進行檢討，並聆聽業界的意見，以決定何時強制業界使用「單一窗口」提交道路貨物艙單。

主席，實施「單一窗口」是一項大型業務和運作流程改革項目，將全面更新並完善業界向參與的政府部門提交貿易文件的工作流程，同時提升香港的貨物清關效率，有助維持香港作為國際貿易中心和物流樞紐的地位。我懇請各位議員支持通過《條例草案》及稍後政府提出的修正案，為明年落實「單一窗口」第三階段提供法律基礎。

我謹此陳辭，謝謝。"
​立法會十題：打擊濫用公共福利及公屋,2025-07-02 15:45,2025-07-02 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200297.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上何俊賢議員的提問和署理房屋局局長戴尚誠的書面答覆：

問題：

根據現行制度，綜合社會保障援助（綜援）計劃（廣東計劃及福建計劃除外）及公共福利金計劃申請人必須符合居港規定及離港寬限。此外，公共租住房屋（公屋）租戶也必須持續在單位居住。然而，據悉有部分人士長居外地卻依然享用長者津貼及公屋等福利。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）⁠據悉社會福利署只利用身份證號碼向入境事務處（入境處）核對綜援及公共福利金受助人的出入境紀錄，部分人士利用身份證與護照的出入境紀錄不互通的漏洞，以護照出入境以避開就離港寬限的查核，政府有否調查上述情況是否屬實；政府有否評估每年因該漏洞而造成的公帑損失，以及有否優化核對機制以堵塞漏洞；如有，詳情（包括優化機制後的成效）為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府有否考慮以生物特徵（例如指紋、面容）作為出入境紀錄唯一的身份識別憑證，以避免部分人士利用第（一）項所述的出入境紀錄漏洞隱瞞長居外地的事實；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）鑑於申訴專員公署於本年一月就當局打擊濫用公屋資源的工作的主動調查行動報告中提及多宗「非經常持續在單位居住」個案，當局目前有何具體機制監察和防止長居外地人士濫用公屋，以及如何評估該等機制的成效；對於故意隱瞞長居外地以保留公屋單位的住戶，除要求交還單位外，政府有何其他法律措施以追究其責任，以及有否評估該等措施是否具足夠阻嚇力；及

（四）鑑於第（三）項所述的多宗「非經常持續在單位居住」個案的戶主及戶籍成員均長居境外，政府有否檢視當時無法透過其出入境紀錄及時發現其濫用公屋情況的原因；為打擊長居外地濫用公屋的情況，政府有否研究設立跨部門合作機制，讓房屋署、香港房屋協會與入境處進行數據共享，以優化就公屋住戶留港紀錄的查閱程序？

答覆：

主席：

就何俊賢議員的提問，經諮詢保安局及勞工及福利局，我們現回覆如下：

（一）綜合社會保障援助（綜援）或公共福利金的申請人及受助人必須符合相關居港規定及其他申請資格，並須向社會福利署（社署）申報全部旅遊證件和其他相關資料。如申請人及受助人沒有如實提供一切有關文件或資料，一經發現，社署會作出跟進，有需要時會轉交執法部門處理。申請人及受助人如蓄意提供虛假資料或漏報資料以圖騙取現金援助，屬刑事行為，除可導致申請人及受助人喪失領取現金援助的資格外，亦可能因觸犯《盜竊罪條例》（香港法例第210章）而被起訴。一經定罪，最高可被判入獄十四年。

此外，按照現有的恆常機制，入境事務處（入境處）定期或應社署要求提供申請人及受助人的出入境記錄，包括這些人士使用香港身份證、由入境處簽發的旅遊證件（包括香港特別行政區護照）及由其他國家／地區簽發的旅遊證件的出入境資料，供社署核實有關人士是否符合相關居港規定。

（二）《入境條例》（香港法例第115章）第5條規定，在香港出入境管制站出入境應出示有效旅行證件。香港居民進出香港境時可使用香港身份證或有效旅行證件在管制站傳統櫃檯辦理出入境手續，而合資格的智能身份證持有人，亦可使用智能身份證或加密二維碼配合指紋或容貌識別技術，於e-道自助辦理出入境手續。

就實施有效的出入境管制而言，入境處於出入境管制運作採用生物特徵（如指紋、容貌）辨識技術，目的是核實以香港身份證或旅行證件出入境的持證人身份之用。

在現有的恆常機制下，入境處向社署及房屋署提供相關人士的出入境記錄，經已涵蓋香港身份證、由入境處簽發的旅行證件（包括香港特別行政區護照），以及由其他國家／地區簽發的旅行證件的出入境資料，協助有關部門核實受助人是否繼續符合領取相關福利的資格。

（三）及（四）香港房屋委員會（房委會）制訂了多管齊下的方式以打擊濫用公屋行為。房屋署一直透過日常屋邨管理工作、定期家訪、抽查及深入調查懷疑個案和宣傳教育等不同渠道，處理濫用公屋的問題，希望藉此減低公屋被濫用的機會，從而加快單位流轉，讓有真正住屋需要的人士早日入住公屋。

為確保善用公屋資源，房屋署已與入境處建立恆常機制：入境處會定期將公屋住戶的死亡紀錄向房屋署通報，讓房屋署可主動偵測租戶的住用情況及採取適當的行動；入境處亦會應房屋署要求提供有關人士（例如公屋戶主及戶籍成員）的出入境紀錄，供房屋署核實有關人士是否仍然符合居住公屋的資格。

為加強監察，房屋署已建立新電腦系統，以儲存有關打擊濫用公屋工作的個案資料、流程及調查結果。屋邨管理人員亦會在非辦公時間進行突擊家訪。若職員懷疑有濫用公屋的情況，或收到公眾舉報的懷疑濫用公屋個案，會展開調查。房屋署亦會隨機抽查個案作深入調查。

此外，為加快查證居住情況的工作流程以核實濫用公屋個案及採取管制行動，房屋署會在符合法例的情況下，聯繫不同政府部門索取關鍵資料（例如當懷疑租戶非經常持續居於單位時向入境處查詢出入境紀錄、向水務署查詢用水量異常用戶等），查證濫用公屋情況，以加快處理濫用公屋個案。

事實上，自二○二三年，房委會亦推出了多項新措施加強打擊濫用公屋。自二○二三年十月，房委會要求所有公屋住戶每兩年申報居住情況和是否擁有香港住宅物業。住戶須申報是否持續居於其公屋單位及有否將單位丟空及作違規用途。若住戶作出虛假申報，房委會會考慮終止單位租約，而作虛假申報的家庭成員在租約終止後會受到五年不得申請公屋及不會獲配質素較佳公屋單位的限制，及有機會遭檢控。自推出措施後，有公屋住戶被法庭判刑三十天，亦有租戶已主動將單位交還。房委會有信心這些措施可持續加強打擊濫用公屋的力度。

為搜集情報以更精準打擊濫用公屋，房委會在二○二五年一月推出「舉報濫用公屋獎」。自推出計劃，截至三月底，在接獲約3 900宗的舉報中，約1 700宗選擇參與獎勵計劃；經初步篩選後，約1 200宗的資料符合參加資格，當中約700宗舉報可作進一步跟進。目前已有成功發出遷出通知書的個案，首輪頒獎儀式將於二○二五年七月舉行，可見公眾已建立強烈共識打擊濫用公屋，共同守護珍貴的房屋資源。

為應付加強打擊濫用公屋的額外工作，房委會近年加強與不同政府部門的聯繫，並因時制宜採用不同的策略和調配人手，包括聘請退休紀律部隊人員加入房屋署。房委會在二○二二年七月至二○二五年五月底，共收回超過8 700個被濫用或違反租約的公屋單位。相比二○二一／二二年度收回約1 400個公屋單位，在二○二二／二三至二○二四／二五年度平均每年收回被濫用或違反租約的公屋單位數目增加超過一倍，可見房委會實施加強措施的成效。

為加強打擊濫用公屋的力度及增加阻嚇力，房屋局向立法會提交了《2025房屋（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》），有關《條例草案》已於二○二五年六月十一日獲立法會通過。《條例草案》主要涉及三個方面：（一）引入嚴重濫用公屋的新罪行；（二）賦權獲授權人員要求可疑人士提供個人資料；及（三）延長虛假陳述、拒絕提供資料及非法讓與罪行的檢控時效，令打擊濫用公屋的措施更具阻嚇力。相關罪行將於二○二六年三月三十一日起正式生效。房委會會向大眾解說有關修例，令公眾人士清楚明白觸犯法例的後果。

房委會／房屋署會繼續檢視現行措施，包括優化調查工作流程，加強職員培訓及公眾宣傳教育等，亦會繼續檢討打擊濫用公屋的策略，加強與其他部門的協作，以維護公屋資源的合理運用。

香港房屋協會（房協）亦一向採取多管齊下的措施，全方位打擊濫用公屋，包括定期家訪，以及優先調查一些較容易出現單位丟空的懷疑個案（例如水電用量偏低或信箱長期積存通告及信件未被領取等）。房協亦已將非辦公時間家訪恆常化，並加強前線工作人員培訓，進一步提高他們對違反租約行為的警覺性和敏感度。另外，房協亦善用智慧科技，協助加強打擊濫用公屋，包括自行研發「家訪易」數碼平台，將租戶資料及家訪紀錄數碼化方便對比，有助前線工作人員於家訪時充分掌握情況，及早抽出可疑個案。房協會繼續與時並進，定期檢視這些措施的成效，有需要時引入更多不同措施以提升家訪的效率及調查濫用公屋個案的成效。

房協與房屋署就加強打擊濫用公屋事宜一直保持緊密溝通和交流，並會不時參考及檢視有關措施的成效。當懷疑有租戶非經常持續在單位居住時，房協會因應個別情況和調查需要，向入境處索取住戶資料，例如出入境紀錄等。另外，房協自二○○五年十月已與入境處建立有關死亡登記紀錄的通報機制。該機制下，入境處每月會向房協提供居住在房協出租屋邨、惟已在香港登記死亡的人士紀錄，以便房協適當跟進。房協會繼續加強與入境處的溝通，以提升調查濫用公屋個案的成效。"
LCQ6: Handling of yard waste,2025-07-02 15:35,2025-07-02 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200529.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Leung and a reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 It is learnt that the yard waste recycling centre Y·PARK mainly receives yard waste such as tree trunks that are six metres long or below, as well as branches, twigs and leaves. Regarding the handling of yard waste, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the public have relayed that uncollected yard waste is often seen on streets and in parks, whether the Government has formulated guidelines requiring the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and their outsourced contractors to first sort the collected yard waste and send the yard waste that can be processed by Y·PARK to the collection point of the Environmental Protection Department; if not, of the reasons for that;

(2) according to the existing procedures, how the LCSD, FEHD and their outsourced contractors handle yard waste that cannot be processed by Y·PARK; of the approximate tonnage of such yard waste in each year since 2019; and

(3) given that Y·PARK has imposed a number of restrictions on the recovery of yard waste, and it is learnt that some companies in the Mainland and the United States adopt anaerobic digestion technology to convert yard waste into biogas for electricity generation, whether the Government will consider adopting such technology to process yard waste, so as to enhance recycling and conversion of waste into energy; if not, of the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The super typhoon Mangkhut that hit Hong Kong in 2018 caused severe damage, uprooting numerous trees, many of which were large trees that could be suitable for timber production. In 2021, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) set up the temporary yard waste recycling centre, Y·PARK, in accordance with the Waste Blueprint for Hong Kong 2035, to collect and process yard waste generated from regular vegetation maintenance and public works projects, and to assist in treating large quantities of yard waste generated shortly after typhoons when needed.

 Yard waste includes grass, leaves, shrubs, twigs and woody tree trunks. Some of them may be affected by pests or diseases. Y·PARK mainly collects and sorts out the high quality and suitable portion of yard waste for recycling into recyclable products of relatively higher values so as to achieve both converting waste to resources and enhancing cost-effectiveness.

 The current Y·PARK is temporary in nature. In future, the Government reserves land in the New Territories North New Town to develop a larger-scale yard waste recycling facility to enhance yard waste handling capacity.

 Having consulted the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), our consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Dennis Leung is as follows:

(1) The Government has established guidelines to drive various government departments, including the FEHD and the LCSD, adhering to the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle, to shred and reuse yard waste as much for gardening on-site as far as possible, while yard waste that cannot be treated or reused on-site could be delivered to suitable recycling facilities for treatment. The EPD has also continuously liaised with government departments, providing relevant guidelines to promote the proper sorting of recyclable yard waste at source and its delivery to Y·PARK for processing. In 2024, the quantity of yard waste disposed of at landfills was about 230 tonnes per day, accounting for about 2 per cent of the municipal solid waste (MSW) disposal of at landfills.

(2) Not all yard waste is suitable for delivering to Y·PARK for processing. According to prevailing handling procedures, when the FEHD, the LCSD and their contractors encounter yard waste unsuitable for recycling, such as yard waste infected by bacteria, infested with pests, or containing large amount of impurities, while providing street cleansing or park management services, such yard waste will be sent directly or via refuse transfer stations to landfills for disposal. From 2019 to April 2025, the LCSD transported an average of about seven tonnes of yard waste unsuitable for recycling to landfills per day, whilst the FEHD does not maintain relevant data.

(3) The Government is developing two main types of waste-to-energy facilities currently. The first type of facilities is the Organic Resources Recovery Centre (O·PARK), adopting anaerobic digestion technology to process food waste. The second type of facilities adopts modern incineration technology to treat waste, such as T·PARK which incinerates sludge to generate electricity, and the Integrated Waste Management Facilities Phase I (I·PARK1) under construction which will incinerate MSW to generate electricity.

 The O·PARKs are designed to treat food waste which contains proteins, sugars, fats and high water content. These substances decompose more easily during anaerobic digestion process, and produce more biogas, resulting in a higher energy conversion efficiency for electricity generation. Under feasible technical conditions, we also make the best use of the existing waste management facilities to test out the treatment of other waste. For instance, while O·PARK2 is mainly for treating food waste, we conducted trials for treating pig waste by anaerobic digestion since its commissioning in March 2024. Following the successful trials, we have fully replaced the previous practice of disposing pig waste at landfills with anaerobic digestion technology since July 2024, which significantly reduced the potential odour issues associated with disposal of pig waste at landfills.

 However, there are significant differences between yard waste and food waste. It requires different treatment methods for yard waste. Yard waste comprises woody waste, such as tree trunks and branches, as well as non-woody waste, such as leaves and grass. Tree trunks and branches are high in wood fiber content and low in moisture content, so they are not easily decomposed by anaerobic digestion. If treating the yard waste by co-digestion by anaerobic digestion technology in O.PARKs, it would not only occupy substantial space in the digestion tanks but would also significantly reduce food waste processing capacity and efficiency. In addition, as woody waste is hard and bulky, it is more difficult to be crushed into pieces as compared with food waste, such that additional energy and water will be required to turn the woody waste into slurry for further treatment. The installation of necessary pre-treatment facilities in O·PARKs and modifications to the existing operation mode will incur a substantial amount of cost but result in low energy efficiency. According to the understanding of the EPD, there are few examples of utilising anaerobic digestion technology to process woody waste in the Mainland or overseas. Even for such cases, they mainly involve processing small amount of non-woody yard waste such as grass and leaves.

 Non-woody garden waste such as grass and leaves can be processed through anaerobic digestion technically, but the process would be less efficient than treating food waste. Considering that such waste contains a certain calorific value and is often mixed with other MSW during collection, treating yard waste by incineration can reduce the need for additional space, processing, and costs associated with sorting yard waste from mixed waste while achieving the same outcome of turning waste into energy. The Government is working full steam on developing two modern large-scale incineration facilities, namely I·PARK1 and I·PARK2. These facilities will handle up to 9 000 tonnes of MSW per day in total in the future, converting waste into electricity. I·PARK1 is expected to commence operation by the end of this year and can assist in handling yard waste.

 Thank you, President."
立法會六題：處理園林廢物,2025-07-02 15:35,2025-07-02 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200532.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上梁子穎議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的答覆︰

問題：

據悉園林廢物回收中心Y‧PARK［林·區］（下稱Y‧PARK）主要接收長度六米或以下的樹幹、樹枝、嫩枝及樹葉等園林廢物。關於處理園林廢物，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有市民反映在街頭和公園常見到未收集的園林廢物，政府有否制訂指引，要求康樂及文化事務署（下稱康文署）、食物環境衞生署（下稱食環署）及其外判承辦商，先將收集到的園林廢物分類，並將可交由Y‧PARK處理的園林廢物送往環境保護署的收集點；如否，原因為何；

（二）根據現時程序，康文署、食環署及其外判承辦商會如何處理Y‧PARK無法處理的園林廢物；二○一九年至今，每年約有多少公噸該類園林廢物；及

（三）鑑於Y‧PARK就回收園林廢物有多項限制，而據悉內地和美國有公司用厭氧消化技術把園林廢物轉化為生物氣發電，政府會否考慮以該技術處理園林廢物，以加強回收及轉廢為能；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

二○一八年吹襲香港的超強颱風山竹造成嚴重破壞，倒塌了大量樹木，當中不少是大型樹木，可以用作生產木料。環境保護署（環保署）於二○二一年，根據《香港資源循環藍圖2035》設立臨時園林廢物回收中心Y‧PARK［林‧區］，收集和處理日常植物保養的清理工作和工務工程所產生的園林廢物，有需要時亦可以協助處理颱風後短時間內所產生的大量園林廢物。

園林廢物包括草、樹葉、灌木、細樹技，以及木質樹幹等，當中亦會有受蟲害或病患影響的樹木。Y‧PARK主要是收集及篩選園林廢料當中優質合適的部分進行回收再造，製成較高價值的再生產品，既轉廢為材，亦提升成本效益。

現時的Y‧PARK是臨時性質，未來政府會於新界北新市鎮預留土地發展更具規模的園林廢物回收設施，以提升園林廢物處理能力。

就梁子穎議員的提問，經諮詢食物環境衞生署（食環署）、康樂及文化事務署（康文署），現綜合回覆如下：

（一）政府一直有制訂指引，以推動各政府部門，包括食環署和康文署，根據減少、重用和循環再造的原則，盡量把園林廢物在原地破碎，並循環再用作園林覆蓋物，而未能原地處理或再用的園林廢物，則運送到合適的回收設施處理。環保署亦一直與政府各部門保持溝通，提供相關指引，推動把適合回收的園林廢物，從源頭做好分類工作，送到Y‧PARK處理。在二○二四年，每日被棄置於堆填區的園林廢物約230公噸，佔整體於堆填區處置的都市固體廢物約2%。

（二）並非所有園林廢物都適合送交Y‧PARK處理。根據現時的處理程序，如食環署、康文署及其聘請的外判承辦商在提供街道潔淨服務或公園管理時，發現不適合回收的園林廢物，例如受細菌感染或被蟲害和混雜了大量其他廢物的園林廢物，便會將這些園林廢物直接，或經廢物轉運站轉送至堆填區處置。在二○一九年至二○二五年四月期間，康文署每日平均約有七公噸不適合回收的園林廢物運往堆填區，而食環署則未有另外備存相關數據。

（三）現時政府主要發展兩類轉廢為能設施：第一類為採用厭氧消化技術處理廚餘的有機資源回收中心，又稱O‧PARK；以及第二類為採用現代焚燒技術處理廢物的設施，例如焚燒污泥發電的T‧PARK，和建設中焚燒都市固體廢物發電的綜合廢物管理設施第一期I‧PARK1。

有機資源回收中心的設計主要針對含蛋白質、糖、脂肪和高水份的廚餘處理，這些物質在厭氧消化過程中較容易分解和產生較多生物氣，轉化為能源發電的效率較高。在技術條件許可下，我們亦有善用現有廢物管理設施去試驗處理其他廢物，例如主要為處理廚餘建設的O‧PARK2，自二○二四年三月開始運作後，我們亦試驗了以厭氧消化技術同步處理豬廢料。在試驗成功後，我們自二○二四年七月起，全面以厭氧消化技術取代以往於堆填區處理豬廢料的做法，大大減低於堆填區處理豬廢料所引起的潛在氣味問題。

然而，園林廢物與廚餘存在顯著差異，需要不同的處理方法。園林廢物包含了木質廢物，例如樹幹及樹枝，以及非木質廢物，例如樹葉及草屑。樹幹及樹枝的木質纖維含量很高和水份含量很低，不容易以厭氧消化技術降解。若在有機資源回收中心以厭氧消化技術同步處理園林廢物，不但會佔用大量厭氧消化缸的空間，還會大幅降低廚餘處理量和處理效能。此外，木質廢物質地堅硬且體積大，相比廚餘較難有效破碎，需額外投入能源和水製成漿液才能處理。在有機資源回收中心增設所需要的預處理設施和調整運作模式來處理園林廢物，會大幅增加成本，能源效益亦會很低。據環保署了解，內地或海外以厭氧消化技術處理木質園林廢物的例子不多，即使有也主要是用作處理少量草和樹葉等非木質的園林廢物。

雖然效率較廚餘低，草和樹葉等非木質的園林廢物技術上可以透過厭氧消化處理，但這些廢物有一定熱值，而且收集期間容易與其他都市固體廢物混雜在一起。以焚燒技術處理可以免卻把這些混雜廢物再分類所需要的額外地方、程序和成本，並且同樣可以達致轉廢為能的效果。政府正全力發展兩座大型現代轉廢為能焚燒處理設施，即I‧PARK1和I‧PARK2，將來合共每日可處理高達9 000公噸的都市固體廢物，並將廢物轉化為電力。預計I‧PARK1今年年底可以開始投入運作，也可以協助處理園林廢物。

多謝主席。"
LCQ9: Measures on alienation restrictions for subsidised sale housing,2025-07-02 15:10,2025-07-02 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200388.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Leung Man-kwong and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Housing, Mr Victor Tai, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 Subsidised sale housing (e.g. the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) and the Green Form Subsidized Home Ownership Scheme (GHS) of the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) as well as the Subsidised Sale Flats Project of the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS)) aim at offering affordable housing to low to middle-income families, whereas HA and HS have, over the years, adopted measures such as imposing alienation restrictions and requiring premium payment to ensure the efficient use of the relevant resources for people in need to acquire their homes. Regarding the measures on alienation restrictions for subsidised sale housing, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) in respect of each subsidised sale housing scheme launched by HA and HS in each of the past 10 years, of the total number of flats resold with premium (a) paid and (b) unpaid, together with a breakdown of such flats by (i) age distribution (i.e. within five years, between five to 10 ‍years and over 10 years), and (ii) distribution of transaction prices (i.e. less than $1 million, $1 million to $2 million, $2 million to $3 ‍million, $3 million to $5 million, $5 million to $7 million, and over $7 million);

(2) of the current number of HOS flats which the alienation restriction period has expired and are eligible for application for resale upon payment of premium, and among them, the proportion of flats which have been resold with premium paid;

(3) of the current number of HOS flats which have never been resold after purchase and its percentage in the total number of HOS flats, together with a breakdown by age of the flats; and

(4) whether the Government will study prohibiting the resale of flats in the private market upon payment of premium in the future HOS and GHS projects, and changing to allow transactions in the secondary market of HOS flats only; if not, of the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 In response to the questions raised by the Hon Leung Man-kwong, our reply is as follows:

(1) The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) has all along been striving to enhance the housing ladder, with a view to helping low to middle-income families achieve home ownership through the sale of subsidised sale flats (SSF). In the next five years (i.e. from 2025/26 to 2029/30), the HA and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) will have a completion of about 56 500 SSF. We believe that the relevant flats can facilitate people in need to achieve their dream of home ownership. We also encourage members of the public to move up the suitable housing ladder according to their own ability.

 In addition to sale of first-hand SSF, the HA also allows SSF owners to sell their flats with premium unpaid in the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) Secondary Market, or to sell, let or otherwise assign their flats in other ways in the open market after payment of premium. The discount rate that HOS owners enjoyed in purchasing their flats will form the basis for premium assessment for removal of the alienation restrictions.

 On the other hand, the HKHS' SSF with premium unpaid are also subject to alienation restrictions. In 1997, the HKHS launched the Flat-For-Sale Scheme (FFSS) Secondary Market, enabling flat owners under HKHS' relevant projects to resell their flats to eligible persons with premium unpaid, subject to the conditions in the respective land lease and provided that such owners have fulfilled the designated ownership period since the date of first assignment.

 Since flats with payment of premium are regarded as private units, the HA and the HKHS do not hold the information on whether relevant flats have been resold, and do not maintain transaction figures of SSF for which premium has been paid in the open market.

 The numbers of transactions of HA's HOS and Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) flats in the HOS Secondary Market in the past 10 years are set out in Annex 1. The total number of transactions amounted to about 21 200.In fact, the HA has all along encouraged the circulation of SSF in the Secondary Market through various initiatives, including the relaxation of the mortgage arrangements for SSF in 2024 to extend the maximum mortgage default guarantee period for the secondary market from 30 years to 50 years, so that buyers can secure mortgage loans of a longer tenor. In the 12 months after the implementation of relevant arrangements, the average number of transactions of second-hand SSF was about 370 per month, which was about 60 per cent higher than the average number of transactions of about 230 per month in the 12 months before the implementation (i.e. from March 2023 to February 2024), representing a significant increase. The total number of transactions of HOS flats in the HA's Secondary Market in 2024 was 3 380, representing an increase of about 1.6 times as compared with the total number of transactions of about 1 320 in 2015.

 The numbers of transactions of HKHS' SSF flats without payment of premium in the FFSS Secondary Market in the past 10 years are set out by year in Annex 2.

(2)As at the first quarter of2025, the HA had about 320 000 HOS flats of which the alienation period has expired, which can be resold in the open market after payment of premium. Among them, 19 per cent of the flats have been paid with premium.

 As at the first quarter of2025, the HKHS had about 22 000 SSF flats of which the alienation restriction period has expired and can be resold in the open market upon payment of premium. Among them, 22 per cent of the flats have been paid with premium.

(3) As at the first quarter of2025, the HA has about 230 000 HOS flats with premium not yet paid and have not been resold. For details of the figures categorised by building age and proportion, please see Annex 3.

 As at the first quarter of2025, HKHS has about 15 000 SSF flats with premium not yet paid and have never been resold. For details of the figures categorised by building age and proportion, please see Annex 4.

(4) In order to effectively curb short-term speculative activities, the HA tightened the alienation restrictions of HOS and GSH flats in January 2022. The period where the owners can only sell at no more than the original price in the Secondary Market with premium unpaid has been lengthened from the first two years since first assignment to the first five years since first assignment; while the restriction period for sale in the open market after payment of premium has also been lengthened from the first 10 years since first assignment to the first 15 years since first assignment.All HKHS SSF developments completed in 2024 or beyond also adopt the aforementioned tightened alienation restrictions introduced by the HA in 2022.

 Allowing HOS and GSH flat owners to sell their flats after the restriction period can facilitate the circulation of second-hand SSF, thereby increasing SSF supply in the market. On the other hand, this measure provides opportunities for owners to move on to the private property market on the housing ladder, which is an initiative to encourage owners' upward mobility and strengthen social's mobility."
立法會九題：資助出售房屋的轉讓限制措施,2025-07-02 15:10,2025-07-02 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200384.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）立法會會議上梁文廣議員的提問和署理房屋局局長戴尚誠的書面答覆：

問題：

資助出售房屋（例如香港房屋委員會（房委會）的居者有其屋計劃（居屋）及綠表置居計劃（綠置居），以及香港房屋協會（房協）的資助出售房屋項目）旨在為低至中收入家庭提供可負擔的住房，而房委會及房協多年來透過設立轉讓限制及要求支付補價等措施，確保有關資源得以有效運用，供有需要人士置業。關於資助出售房屋的轉讓限制措施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去十年就每項由房委會及房協推出的資助出售房屋計劃，每年（a）經補地價及（b）未補地價而轉售的單位總數為何，並按（i）該等單位的樓齡分布（即五年內、五年至十年，以及十年以上），以及（ii）其成交價格分布（即一百萬元以下、一百萬元至二百萬元、二百萬元至三百萬元、三百萬元至五百萬元、五百萬元至七百萬元，以及七百萬元以上）列出分項數字；

（二）現時有多少個居屋單位已屆滿轉讓限制期，並可申請補價轉售，以及當中已補價並已轉售單位的比例為何；

（三）現時在購入後從未轉售的居屋單位數目及其佔所有居屋單位數目的百分比為何，並按單位樓齡列出分項資料；及

（四）政府會否研究在未來的居屋及綠置居項目中，禁止單位補價後於私人市場轉售，並改為僅可在二手居屋市場交易；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就梁文廣議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直致力完善房屋階梯，透過出售資助出售單位協助中低收入家庭自置居所。在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），房委會和香港房屋協會（房協）將會有約56500個資助出售單位落成，我們相信有關單位定能協助有需要的人士實現置業夢想。我們亦鼓勵市民按自己的能力選擇合適的房屋階梯上流。

房委會除了出售一手資助出售單位，亦容許資助出售單位的業主在無需補價的情況下可在居者有其屋（居屋）第二市場出售單位，或在補價後在公開市場出售、出租或以其他方式轉讓單位。業主在購買時所享有的折扣率，也是解除轉讓限制時計算補價的基礎。

另一方面，房協出售的資助出售單位在補價前亦受轉讓限制約束。房協於一九九七年設立「住宅發售計劃」第二市場，房協相關項目單位的業主，按照各自項目的相關地契條款，於滿足指定的購入年期後和無須補地價的情況下，可將單位轉售予合資格的人士。

由於已補價單位屬私有化單位，房委會及房協皆不掌握有關單位是否已轉售，亦沒有備存已補價的資助出售單位在公開市場的轉讓交易數字。

過去十年，房委會居屋及綠表置居計劃（綠置居）單位在居屋第二市場的交易數目見附件一，交易總數約為21 200宗。事實上，房委會一直以來透過不同的措施鼓勵資助出售單位在第二市場流轉，當中包括於二○二四年放寬資助出售單位的按揭貸款安排，將第二市場的按揭貸款保證期由三十年延長至五十年，讓買家可獲得年期更長的按揭貸款。在有關安排落實後的十二個月，二手資助出售單位平均每月成交宗數約370宗，比落實前十二個月（即二○二三年三月至二○二四年二月）的平均每月成交宗數約230宗，顯著上升約六成。房委會居屋單位於二○二四年在居屋第二市場的交易總數約3380宗，比二○一五年的交易總數約1320宗，上升約1.6倍。

過去十年，房協資助出售房屋每年未補價在「住宅發售計劃」第二市場轉售的單位交易數目見附件二。

（二）截至二○二五年第一季，房委會約有32萬個居屋單位已屆滿轉讓限期並可於補價後在公開市場出售。此類單位中，已補價單位的佔比為19%。

截至二○二五年第一季，房協約有2.2萬個資助出售房屋單位已屆滿轉讓限制期而符合資格於補價後在公開市場出售。此類單位中，已補價單位的佔比為22%。

（三）截至二○二五年第一季，房委會約有23萬個未補價及未經轉售的居屋單位，按樓齡及比例劃分的數字詳見附件三。

截至二○二五年第一季，房協約有1.5萬個未補價及從未轉售的資助出售單位，按樓齡及比例劃分的數字詳見附件四。

（四）為有效防止短期投機活動，房委會於二○二二年一月收緊居屋和綠置居單位的轉讓限制。第二市場無須補價以不高於原價轉售的期限，已由首次轉讓日期起計兩年延長至五年；於公開市場在繳付補價後出售單位的期限，亦已由首次轉讓日期起計十年延長至十五年。房協於二○二四年或以後落成的資助出售單位亦採納房委會上述的轉讓限制。

容許居屋和綠置居業主在禁售期後出售其單位，一方面能促進二手資助出售單位的流轉，為市場增加供應，另一方面亦為業主提供在房屋階梯轉投私人住宅市場的機會，是一個協助資助房屋業主上進上流，加強社會動力的措施。"

Question:

 The Third Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC Central Committee) has adopted the Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on Further Deepening Reform Comprehensively to Advance Chinese Modernization, in which it is pointed out that Hong Kong needs to further capitalise on its strengths and become an international hub for high-calibre talents. There are views that attracting international talents requires efforts on various fronts, among which, the creation of an international living environment and the setting up of well-established English information channels for demonstration of Hong Kong's cultural diversity, openness and inclusiveness are particularly important. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the percentage of broadcast time in foreign languages out of the total broadcast time in respect of the public broadcasting services in Hong Kong at present, and how the relevant time and percentage compare with those in other international metropolises;

(2) of the specific policies and whether resources have been allocated to encourage local television and sound broadcasters to produce more quality English-language programmes, especially those with contents showcasing the business environment, cultural characteristics, lifestyle, etc, in Hong Kong;

(3) whether it has evaluated the effectiveness of the existing English media contents in attracting and retaining international talents; whether it has conducted relevant surveys to understand the information needs of international talents;

(4) whether it will consider setting up an additional 24-hour English channel on Radio Television Hong Kong and producing more English programmes to present a soft and down-to-earth introduction of the policies and development opportunities in Hong Kong, so as to enable international talents and inbound tourists to obtain local information more conveniently; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) of the Government's plans to enhance Hong Kong's international image and visibility by arranging additional media coverage in English, given that the 15th National Games and other international events are about to take place; and

(6) apart from traditional television broadcasters, whether it has plans to make use of emerging publicity channels, such as digital platforms and social media, to produce more information contents about Hong Kong in English, so as to strengthen Hong Kong's international communication capability, thereby creating a more attractive international living environment; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The HKSAR Government has been striving to showcase the unique characteristics of Hong Kong, being an international metropolis, from various perspectives to attract international talents and tourists by telling the good stories of Hong Kong through diverse television and radio programmes, as well as different promotion measures. Having consulted the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) and the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, our consolidated response is as follows:

 Hong Kong's broadcasting market is under steady development. The three domestic free television programme service (free TV) licensees, two sound broadcasting licensees and Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) are providing a total of 15 television channels and 14 radio channels respectively, which include five TV channels and three radio channels in English. The general public (including non-Chinese-speaking persons in Hong Kong) can choose and enjoy diverse television and radio programmes (including English-language programmes) with a wide variety according to their needs. The HKSAR Government does not maintain related information in other regions.

 Under the current broadcasting regulatory framework, licensed broadcasters shall provide English programmes through their designated English channels in accordance with their licence conditions. Considering the sustainable development of licensed broadcasters and the needs of different audience, the three domestic free TV English channels are currently required to broadcast English programmes for at least 55 per cent of the broadcasting hours. Although licensed broadcasters can exercise suitable flexibility to broadcast non-English programmes for not more than 45 per cent of the broadcasting hours on their English channels, free TV licensees must broadcast English programmes during prime time on their English channels as required to cater for the needs of the general public and non-Chinese-speaking persons in Hong Kong. We also note that the current English programmes offered by licensed broadcasters cover a wide range of genres, including news, current affairs, sports, cultural features, lifestyle and arts, etc.

 On the other hand, RTHK also proactively offers English programmes through its radio and TV channels, including launching English programme time slots on RTHK TV 31 and 32; providing 24-hour relay of the China Global Television Network Documentary and English Channels under the China Media Group on RTHK TV 34 and 35; providing 24-hour broadcasting with diverse English programmes on RTHK Radio 3; and broadcasting bilingual programmes featuring fine music and arts information on RTHK Radio 4, etc. These help exhibit Hong Kong's diversity and global vision, proactively telling good stories of the country and Hong Kong and enabling non-Chinese speaking persons in Hong Kong to have a better understanding of various information about Hong Kong and Mainland China.

 Since the three free TV licences will expire in 2027 and 2028, the Communications Authority (CA) has commenced the renewal exercise of the free TV licences and will conduct a public consultation exercise in the third quarter of 2025. In processing the renewal applications, subject to actual circumstances, the CA will consider revisions to licence conditions and regulatory requirements on free TV services (including requirements on English channels and programmes) taking into account views from the industry and the public as well as the latest market development and submit recommendations on licence renewal to the Chief Executive in Council.

 Regarding the attraction of talents, talents are generally concerned about employment and business start-up opportunities, children's education and social integration when considering pursuance of development in Hong Kong. Media in English, being an international language, helps disseminate relevant information to international talents, alleviating their concern about integration into local society. To facilitate social integration of international talents in a more proactive manner, the Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) of the LWB has been providing comprehensive support services to help them stay in the city for development. With a view to ensuring that the comprehensive information about living and working in Hong Kong are accessible to international talents, the HKTE's promotional and publicity materials, including its online platform, TV Announcements in the Public Interest, social media posts, etc, are already fully available in English, and its themed seminars on living in Hong Kong also offer online livestreaming and simultaneous interpretation services. On the other hand, the HKTE launched the Talent+ Volunteer Programme in September 2024, and has been collaborating with various non-governmental organisations, working partners and corporations to provide incoming talents with diverse volunteer service opportunities, strengthening their connections with the local community and fostering their sense of belonging to the city.

 As for promotion of mega events, the CSTB, in collaboration with relevant government departments and organisations, has been devising extensive publicity campaigns through diverse means for the 15th National Games (NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG), including various overseas promotional initiatives with the support of the Information Services Department (ISD), such as running advertisements in overseas media and at a number of major overseas international airports, engaging overseas key opinion leaders to publish promotional posts, and inviting overseas journalists and guests to visit Hong Kong through thematic media visit programmes and the Sponsored Visitors Programme so that they can spread their positive visiting experiences in their hometown afterwards, with a view to raising the international profile and popularity of Hong Kong and attracting more overseas spectators to the events. RTHK will also fully engage in the promotion, production and live broadcast of the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG. Besides, for organisation of major events, depending on the nature of the events, the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) will invite media in English and other foreign languages to participate in press conferences or carry out promotional campaigns, and will also collaborate with local and international media organisations and event partners (such as relevant Consulates-General in Hong Kong, cultural organisations stationed in Hong Kong as well as the overseas Economic and Trade Offices) to promote the events. The LCSD will make good use of its social media platforms for promotion and support bilingual content so as to promote featured events to local and overseas audiences.

 Apart from the above promotion measures, the ISD has been setting up accounts on various social media platforms and producing more English social media posts for promotion. The ISD has also co-operated with the national media to make use of their multi-language new media platforms to promote Hong Kong to more countries through different foreign languages. Besides, the ISD will continue to work with suitable overseas media organisations to produce content on Hong Kong's latest development in key areas, such as innovation and technology, sports, shipping, and culture and arts, etc, with the aim of expanding the reach of overseas promotional efforts through their readers' network and social media platforms. Through monitoring of the latest market development and global trend, the ISD will continue to make use of appropriate platforms to raise the international profile of Hong Kong."

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二四年底，約480萬名強制性公積金（強積金）計劃成員共持有約1 120萬個不同類型的強積金帳戶（包括供款帳戶、個人帳戶和可扣稅自願性供款帳戶），即每位計劃成員平均持有多於2.3個強積金帳戶。過去五年強積金計劃成員和帳戶的數目、按計劃成員年齡組別劃分每個強積金帳戶的平均累算權益金額，以及按累算權益金額劃分的帳戶數目表列如下：

由於計劃成員可持有多於一個帳戶，而有關帳戶或會分散於不同強積金計劃，因此現時未能提供按總累算權益劃分的計劃成員數目。積金易平台已於二○二四年六月開始運作，各強積金計劃正陸續加入積金易平台，待所有計劃加入平台後，便可以透過積金易平台編制有關個人強積金總累算權益的資料。

（二）設立強積金制度旨在協助市民為退休作儲蓄，有關容許計劃成員借出其強積金權益作置業用途的構思，必須顧及措施對計劃成員退休儲備造成的影響。強積金屬於長線投資，並具有複息效應的特點，其設計原意在於讓強積金權益在計劃成員的工作生涯中不斷滾存增值，達至積少成多的效果，故此應盡量保存至就業人士退休時才可提取使用。如果我們放寬保存強積金權益的要求，容許計劃成員借出以滿足置業需要，會使其失去滾存增值的機會，令計劃成員用作退休儲備的強積金權益相應減少，削弱勞動人口的基本退休保障。此外，由於強積金制度有分散投資風險的優勢，房地產投資的風險一般較強積金基金投資為高。有關要求市民於借出強積金權益作置業用途後分期還款，以及售出以強積金權益支付首期的樓宇後用所得款項償還借款的安排亦具相當複雜性。

（三）在強積金制度下，僱主和僱員現時須分別作出僱員有關入息百分之五的強制性供款（每月供款上限現為1,500元）。假如強積金制度要同時為醫療或置業開支作儲蓄，在不影響就業人士退休保障的前提下，我們必須要考慮提升強積金總供款率。參考香港以外地區（例如內地及新加坡）的做法，若要設立專項儲蓄帳戶以滿足醫療和置業開支，相關帳戶所作的供款佔僱員薪酬的比率高達百分之三十以上。在目前強制性總供款率只有百分之十的情況下，有關在強積金制度增設醫療或置業專項儲蓄帳戶，並提升強積金總供款率的建議，必須先取得社會廣泛共識。

政府和積金局歡迎各界就強積金制度提出意見，並會審慎評估各項建議的必要性和可行性，在不削弱計劃成員基本退休保障的前提下持續完善強積金制度的運作。"

答覆：

主席︰

香港作為國際大都會，特區政府一直致力從多角度展現香港特色，吸引國際人才及旅客來港，其中包括透過多元化的電視及電台節目和不同的宣傳措施，說好香港故事。經諮詢勞工及福利局（勞福局）、文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）及民政及青年事務局，現綜合回覆如下：

香港的廣播市場發展穩健。三家本地免費電視節目服務（免費電視）牌照持有人、兩家聲音廣播牌照持有人和香港電台（港台）合共提供分別15條電視頻道及14條電台頻道，其中包括五條英語電視頻道和三條英語電台頻道。市民大眾（包括在港非華語人士）能按需要選擇及享受多元化且種類繁多的電視及電台節目（包括英語節目）。特區政府並無備存其他地區的相關資料。

在現行的廣播規管制度下，持牌廣播機構必須按照其牌照要求透過英語頻道提供英語節目。考慮到持牌廣播機構的可持續發展及不同觀眾的需要，現時三家本地免費電視的英語頻道須廣播英語節目的時間至少為55%。雖然現時持牌廣播機構有適當彈性選擇在英語頻道播放不多於45%的其他非英語的節目，但免費電視持牌機構必須按規定在其英語頻道的黃金時段播放英語節目，以滿足市民及在港非華語人士的需要。我們亦留意到現時持牌廣播機構的英語節目種類涵蓋新聞、時事、體育、文化特色及生活藝術等不同範疇。

另一方面，港台亦積極透過其電台及電視頻道提供英語節目，包括於港台電視31及港台電視32增設英語節目時段、透過港台電視34及港台電視35全日24小時轉播中央廣播電視總台旗下中國環球電視網的紀錄頻道和英語頻道、香港電台第三台提供24小時廣播及多元化的英文節目，以及香港電台第四台以雙語播放「美樂及藝術資訊」內容的節目等，呈現香港的多元性及國際視野，積極說好國家和香港故事，讓在港非華語人士能了解更多香港和內地的不同資訊。

鑑於三個免費電視牌照有效期將於二○二七年及二○二八年屆滿，通訊事務管理局（通訊局）已展開免費電視牌照的續期程序，並會在今年第三季展開公眾諮詢。在處理續期申請時，通訊局亦會因應業界和公眾的意見及市場的最新發展，按實際情況考慮可作修訂的牌照條件及其他有關免費電視服務的規管安排（包括對英語頻道和節目的要求），然後向行政長官會同行政會議就牌照續期提交建議。

吸引人才方面，人才來港發展普遍考慮就業與創業機會、子女教育及融入本地生活的情況。英語作為國際語言，英語媒體有助向國際人才發放相關資訊，在一定程度上釋除他們對融入本地社會的憂慮。為了更積極協助國際人才融入香港，勞福局轄下的香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）一直致力為他們提供全方位的支援服務，協助他們留港發展。人才辦的線上平台、電視宣傳短片、社交媒體平台帖文等宣傳推廣資料已全面提供英文版本，而有關在港生活的主題研討會亦提供網上直播及即時傳譯服務，確保國際人才能夠得到在港生活及工作的全方位資訊。人才辦亦已於二○二四年九月推出人才義工計劃，聯繫不同非政府機構、合作夥伴及企業，為來港人才提供多元化的義工服務機會，加強他們與本地社區的連繫及對香港的歸屬感。

推廣盛事方面，文體旅局正聯同各政府部門及相關機構透過多元化渠道為第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）進行廣泛推廣工作，包括在政府新聞處（新聞處）的協助下於海外進行各種宣傳，例如於海外媒體和多個海外主要國際機場投放廣告、與海外關鍵意見領袖合作發布帖文，以及透過專題採訪計劃和貴賓訪港計劃邀請海外媒體和貴賓到訪香港後向其地區宣傳正面的訪港經驗等，以提升香港的國際形象與知名度，吸引更多旅客來港欣賞賽事。港台亦會全力為十五運會和殘特奧會進行推廣、製作節目和直播工作。另外，在舉辦大型活動時，康樂及文化事務署（康文署）會因應活動性質邀請英語及其他外語媒體參與新聞發布會或進行廣告推廣，亦會與本地及國際媒體機構和活動夥伴（例如相關駐港總領事館、駐港文化機構、海外經濟貿易辦事處等）攜手合作推廣活動。康文署會充分利用其社交媒體平台進行宣傳，並且支援中英對照的內容，將具特色的活動推廣至本地及海外受眾。

除了上述宣傳措施外，新聞處現時已在多個社交媒體平台設立帳號，又撰寫更多英語帖文宣傳香港，並與中央媒體合作，利用他們境外的多語種新媒體平台，以多國語言向更多國家推廣香港。此外，新聞處持續與合適的海外媒體合作製作內容，介紹香港在重大領域的最新發展，例如創新及科技、體育、航運、文化藝術等，通過他們的讀者網絡和社交媒體平台，擴大海外宣傳的接觸面。新聞處會繼續留意市場最新發展和世界趨勢，善用合適平台提升香港的國際形象。"

LCQ7: Improving Mandatory Provident Fund system,2025-07-02 15:00,2025-07-02 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200351.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 This year marks the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) system. According to statistics from the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, the total MPF assets amounted to around $1,340 billion as at the end of March this year. On improving the MPF system, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of MPF scheme members and their average MPF asset levels in each of the past five years, and set out in the table below with a breakdown by age group (i.e. (i) below 25, (ii) between 25 and below 30, (iii) between 35 and below 45, (iv) between 45 and below 55, (v) between 55 and below 65, and (vi) 65 or above), and MPF asset levels (i.e. (a) $200,000 or below, (b) between $200,001 and $400,000, (c) between $400,001 and $600,000, (d) between $600,001 and $800,000, (e) between $800,001 and $1,000,000, (f) between $1,000,001 and $1,500,000, (g) between $1,500,001 and $2,000,000, and (h) above $2,000,000);

(2) as the Government indicated in its reply to a question from a Member of this Council on May 7 this year that allowing members of the public to make early withdrawals of their accrued benefits to meet home ownership needs would result in such accrued benefits leaking from the system and failing to accumulate for growth in value, thereby undermining the integrity of the MPF system, but there are views that the Government may consider allowing members of the public to borrow the accrued benefits from their MPF accounts to fund a down payment on their first home, with repayment made in instalments over the mortgage term of the purchased property and all outstanding amounts in the MPF account to be repaid immediately upon the sale of the property, which will create a closed-loop funding mechanism to prevent funds from flowing out of the owner-occupied property market or MPF accounts, thereby maximising the value of MPF in supporting people's retirement, whether the government will consider the aforesaid proposal; and

(3) given that Hong Kong is about to become a super-aged society, whether the Government will consider emulating the provident fund systems of the Mainland and Singapore by setting up designated contribution accounts targeting areas such as healthcare and housing under the MPF system in the long term, and increasing the income ratio for MPF contributions to help members of the public to cope with various expenses after retirement?

Reply:

President,

 In consultation with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA), the reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) As at end-2024, about 4.8 million Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) scheme members held a total of around 11.2 million MPF accounts of various types (including contribution accounts, personal accounts and tax-deductible voluntary contribution accounts), hence each scheme member held more than 2.3 MPF accounts on average. The number of MPF scheme members and accounts over the past five years, the average amount of accrued benefits per MPF account by the age group of scheme members, and the number of accounts by the amount of accrued benefits are tabulated below:

 As each scheme member may hold more than one account, and the accounts may be held under different MPF schemes, figures on the number of scheme members by their total accrued benefits are not available at present. MPF schemes are gradually onboarding to the eMPF Platform, which commenced operation in June 2024. Upon completion of onboarding of all MPF schemes, data relating to total MPF accrued benefits by individual scheme members could be compiled via the eMPF Platform.

(2) The MPF system is set up to assist the public to save up for their retirement. The idea of allowing scheme members to borrow their MPF benefits for the purpose of home ownership must take into consideration the impact on scheme members' retirement savings. MPF is a long-term investment with compounding effect, designed to allow MPF benefits to accumulate steadily and be kept in the accounts for value growth during the working life of scheme members. Therefore, accrued benefits should be preserved as far as possible and only be withdrawn and used upon retirement of the employed persons. If we were to relax the preservation requirement on MPF benefits and allow scheme members to borrow their MPF benefits to meet home ownership needs, the accrued benefits would fail to accumulate for value growth, thereby reducing scheme members' MPF benefits meant for their retirement and undermining the basic retirement protection for the working population. Furthermore, as the MPF system has the advantage of diversifying investment risks, investments in real estate bear higher risks than those in MPF funds in general. The arrangements requiring members of the public to repay in instalments after borrowing MPF benefits for home ownership purpose and make repayment with the proceeds from the sale of the property of which the down payment was met by MPF benefits also entail considerable complexity.

(3) Under the MPF system, employers and employees are currently required to respectively make mandatory contributions equivalent to 5 per cent of the employee's relevant income (with the current monthly contribution cap at $1,500). If the MPF system were to save up for medical and home ownership expenses at the same time without affecting the retirement protection for employed persons, we must consider increasing the overall MPF contribution rate. Drawing on practices in regions outside Hong Kong (such as the Mainland and Singapore), should dedicated savings accounts be set up to cover medical and home ownership expenses, the contribution rate to the relevant accounts could be as high as over 30 per cent of the employee's income. Given that the current total mandatory contribution rate stands at only 10 per cent, the proposal of introducing dedicated savings accounts for medical and home ownership purposes under the MPF system and raising the total MPF contribution rate must first reach a broad societal consensus.

 The Government and the MPFA welcome views regarding the MPF system from various sectors, and will carefully assess the necessity and feasibility of each proposal to continuously improve the operation of the MPF system without compromising the basic retirement protection for scheme members."

立法會二題：預防水管爆裂,2025-07-02 14:56,2025-07-02 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200458.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上周浩鼎議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的答覆：

問題：

政府在本年五月十四日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，水務署推行的「智管網」已於本年三月底完成設立全部2 400個監測區域，以協助加強管理供水管網滲漏。然而，據報地下水管爆裂事故依然頻繁發生，屯門區更於本年六月初在一周內發生多宗水管爆裂事故。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否檢視在「智管網」完成設立後仍接連發生地下水管爆裂事故的原因，以及有否研究改善方案；

（二）有否計劃在全港的食水分配管網設立更多獨立監測區域，並增加管網內的高科技監測和感應設備的數量，以及早發現地下水管異常情況，加強監察效果；及

（三）有何措施減低大型水管爆裂事故所造成的影響，包括有否考慮在水管老化的地區（例如屯門區）增設後備供水網絡，以減低事故發生時停水對當區居民及商戶的影響？

答覆：

主席︰

就周議員的提問，我現答覆如下：

（一）水務署自二○一六年起建立「智管網」，並已於二○二五年三月底完成設立2 400個監測區域，覆蓋約八成食水分配管網，加強管理供水管網滲漏。在二○二四年，水務署透過「智管網」偵測到政府食水水管的滲漏個案數目約為1 200多宗，讓署方及早進行維修，而食水水管滲漏比率已由二○○○年約25%下降至去年約13.4%。

但「智管網」的監測範圍目前尚未覆蓋主幹食水水管及餘下約兩成的食水分配管網，所以我們須擴闊其覆蓋範圍。此外，部分老舊水管，例如老舊鑄鐵及石棉水泥等物料所鑄造的水管因外部比較脆弱，即使水管在「智管網」的監測範圍內，如果受外力衝擊時有較大機會突然爆裂，所以我們亦需要按風險情況安排更換這些水管。

（二）考慮到上述情況，水務署已於去年年底開始擴大「智管網」監測範圍至食水主幹水管及餘下約兩成的食水分配管網。此外，水務署正陸續更新監測水管流量及水壓的傳感器，務求加快識別及處理潛在爆裂風險的水管。水務署計劃於二○二七年完成上述擴大及更新「智管網」的工作，我們已要求署方探討提早完成的可能性。

此外，水務署一直與本地及內地學術及科研機構合作，研究應用其他先進科技，例如聲納勘察、光纖技術等，協助及早發現水管滲漏情況。水務署將會與香港理工大學合作，在今年八月成立「管道機械人」聯合實驗室，為水管進行高精確度檢測。

要整個供水系統不同部分都能夠提供實時資訊，我們亦要在用戶端做工夫。在這方面，水務署已強制要求於二○一八年展開的新樓宇項目在用戶端安裝智能水錶。至於現有樓宇，水務署亦計劃陸續推動，目標是配合用戶日常的生活模式調節喉管內的水壓，做到整個供水管網系統可以「動態減壓」，以減低水管爆裂和滲漏風險。

（三）水務署在二○○○年至二○一五年進行了一項全港性更換及修復水管計劃，當時更換及修復了長約3 000公里的老化水管。

由二○一五年至二○二五年三月，再有約240公里長的水管已完成更換或修復。水務署去年獲立法會撥款，更換或修復約20公里長的大型鋼喉管，初步預計在二○二九年或之前陸續完成，當中約四公里的喉管位於屯門區。

水務署正檢視更換水管的考慮因素，包括滲漏或爆裂風險及其後果，以及更換水管的優先次序，稍後會提交短、中期計劃供發展局檢視。

現時水務署在一些重要設施（例如醫院）已提供雙重供水網絡，以加強供水的韌性。然而，倘若要在所有水管老化的地區增設後備供水網絡，需要考慮多方面的因素，例如市區地下設施密集、地下空間是否足夠；以及有關做法是否符合成本效益，因為建設和管理大部分時間只處於備用狀態的後備水管必定涉及相當的額外資源。

在發生水管爆裂事故時，水務署會採取適當措施，盡可能減少停水的影響範圍及時間，包括在可行的情況下在相連管網暫時調度食水以維持供應。

水務署亦會繼續加強供水事故應變管理，包括部署足夠水車以便短時間內應付突發需求，並且就緊急維修水管工作的消息發布機制更新內部指引，以及加強與各區民政事務處、區議員和關愛隊的溝通，建立即時通訊平台迅速互相通報。

水務署近年積極推動供水服務數字化，制定及加快推動「智慧水務」，相信透過分階段探索和實施一系列數碼化項目及利用科技、適時資源調配、有序工程部署和社區配合，水管管理和應變工作會日趨完善。

"LCQ3: Promoting development of ""home-stay lodgings""",2025-07-02 14:55,2025-07-02 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200536.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

There are views that expensive accommodation costs, as well as lack of variety and limited choices are related to the fact that only about 66 per cent of Mainland tourists stayed overnight in Hong Kong during this year's Labour Day Golden Week, and that the Government should make good use of the natural resources in rural areas to develop home-stay lodgings, thereby extending tourists' length of stay. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it has been reported that Japan has relaxed its regulations on home-stay lodgings in recent years to focus more on management requirements than on strict hardware facility standards for hotels and guesthouses, whether the Government has studied regulating home-stay lodgings in this direction; if so, of the details;

(2) as there are views that Hong Kong has many rural locations with natural scenic beauty and potential for developing home-stay lodgings, such as Pui O and Mui Wo, whether the Government will study allowing village houses in such locations that have been issued with a Certificate of Compliance to automatically be eligible to operate as home-stay lodgings, in order to streamline the administrative procedures for applying to operate home-stay lodgings; if so, of the timetable; and

(3) as it has been reported that a private kitchen in rural areas has encountered considerable difficulties when applying for restaurant licences, whether the Government will relax requirements in the light of the unique circumstances of rural areas, and proactively assist rural home-stay lodgings that also operate restaurants by processing licences for both simultaneously, so as to accelerate the development of home-stay lodgings?

Reply:

President,

In response to the three parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan Hok-fung, having consulted the Development Bureau and the Environment and Ecology Bureau, my consolidated reply is as follows:

The Office of the Licensing Authority (OLA) under the Home Affairs Department is responsible for licensing and enforcement work under the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance (Cap. 349). The purpose of the Ordinance is to ensure that premises intended for use as hotels or guesthouses meet statutory building and fire safety standards to protect the safety of lodgers and the public. Moreover, as guests typically only stay in hotels or guesthouses during nighttime or for short periods and may not be familiar with escape routes, it is necessary to establish reasonable safety requirements to protect their safety. Under the current system, any premises providing paid short-term accommodation, including hotels, guesthouses or so-called ""home-stay lodgings"", must comply with the building and fire safety standards stipulated in the Ordinance before being licensed to operate. The Ordinance does not impose special restrictions on or exclude ""home-stay lodgings"". As long as the operation mode falls within the definition of hotel or guesthouse, an application for a licence to operate can be made, regardless of whether the premises is located in an urban or a rural area.

The OLA has long been adopting a flexible and pragmatic approach in processing all licence applications to facilitate the operation of licensed premises. When processing hotel and guesthouse licence applications, the OLA ensures that premises under the applications meet basic safety requirements such as building and fire safety standards, while taking into account the scale and operation mode of the premises. Additionally, premises must comply with relevant requirements of the Ordinance, in order to safeguard the safety of lodgers and the public while balancing the interests of other owners of premises in the same building. Most of these requirements were introduced by the Amendment Ordinance in 2020, including the no-use restriction requirement (i.e. there should be no restrictive clauses in the deed of mutual covenant or Government lease of the premises concerned) and the person responsible for operating, opening, or managing a hotel or guesthouse must meet the fit and proper requirement. The application process does not impose additional restrictions for ""home-stay lodgings"" type operations. Upon receiving a licence application, the OLA will conduct an on-site inspection and formulate applicable licensing requirements based on the specific circumstances of each premises. The Government has always prioritised public safety as its foremost consideration while striving to foster the healthy development of the industry. As long as the safety of guests, other persons in the same building and the general public is ensured, the OLA will proactively facilitate the application and approval processes for licences.

Currently, land leases for small houses in the New Territories generally permit non-industrial uses, including operation as guesthouses. Therefore, as long as the small house has obtained either a Certificate of Compliance or a ""No Objection to Occupy"" Letter from the Lands Department, no lease modification would be required. However, a guesthouse licence would still need to be applied for to operate a guesthouse so as to ensure the safety of lodgers and the general public.

However, we understand that village houses in rural areas have their own unique characteristics and constraints. The OLA has always adopted a flexible and pragmatic approach in processing such applications, allowing applicants to propose alternative solutions on a case-by-case basis to meet the requirements for licensing, provided that building and fire safety are ensured. As long as there is no compromise of public safety, relevant departments will consider local situations when processing applications for rural and old village houses, with a view to facilitating applicants to meet the licensing requirements.

As at May 31, 2025, 108 village houses in the New Territories or outlying islands in Hong Kong have been issued with guesthouse licences.

In fact, to promote eco-tourism, facilitate visitors, and help revitalise desolate villages, the Government's inter-departmental task force has formulated a series of streamlined measures to facilitate guesthouse and food business licence applications for some 90 countryside villages in the New Territories that have no vehicular access, taking into account the uniqueness of remote rural areas. These streamlined measures cover various aspects, including town planning, land, fire safety, building safety and sanitary requirements. Currently, relevant licences have been obtained for some guesthouses in Lai Chi Wo, a takeaway shop in Yim Tin Tsai, and a restaurant in Kuk Po under these streamlined measures. Based on these actual cases, the Government is sorting out the requirements, details, and implementation procedures of the streamlined measures and will compile a set of Guide to Application for reference by interested operators. The Government will continue to review room for enhancement in the licence application process for guesthouses and food businesses in countryside areas, with a view to creating a more business-friendly environment to support the work of countryside conservation and revitalisation.

âUnder the inter-departmental collaboration mechanism, the first batch of guesthouse licences was successfully issued for 11 village houses in Lai Chi Wo between December 2021 and September 2022.

Thank you, President."
​立法會五題：推動穩定幣的發展,2025-07-02 14:54,2025-07-02 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200431.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上吳傑莊議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的答覆：

問題：

本年五月通過的《穩定幣條例草案》旨在於香港設立法幣穩定幣發行人的發牌及監管制度。有意見認為這是全球Web3發展的里程碑，也是香港成為國際Web3中心的重要一步。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）如何推動穩定幣應用場景的拓展，包括推動穩定幣發行機構與內地應用場景連結，以促進穩定幣從監管合規到商業生態落地；

（二）政府如何藉着《穩定幣條例》的實施，在國際層面推介香港穩定幣法規的開放性和靈活性，並結合香港在「一國兩制」下的優勢，以及有利穩定幣發展的國際金融中心地位，吸引全球合規穩定幣發行機構及大型國際金融機構來港發行穩定幣並落戶香港；及

（三）會否為發展離岸人民幣穩定幣作出準備，包括爭取中央支持，以確立香港離岸人民幣穩定幣的信用？

答覆：

主席：

今年五月，立法會通過了《穩定幣條例草案》，為香港引入錨定法定貨幣的穩定幣發行人發牌制度。條例進一步完善香港數字資產活動的監管框架，以保障貨幣和金融穩定，並鞏固提升香港國際金融中心的地位。《穩定幣條例》將於今年八月一日生效，屆時香港金融管理局（金管局）將開始接受牌照申請。目前，金管局正就落實條例的具體指引進行市場諮詢，爭取盡快訂立指引。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢金管局，我現答覆如下：

（一）為了釋放穩定幣的潛力，政府及監管機構將提供有利的環境及必要的監管指引，促進香港持牌穩定幣發行人探索並實現不同的穩定幣應用場景，以解決經濟活動中的實際痛點，針對潛在風險提出監管重點，推動市場可持續發展。

其中，金管局在去年年初推出穩定幣發行人「沙盒」，旨在了解計劃在香港發行法幣穩定幣的機構的業務模式，並傳達監管預期及提供指引，同時促進穩定幣實際應用場景的發展。參與機構來自不同業界，包括跨境電商和物流、創新科技、銀行以及電訊服務行業，並具有本地和非本地背景。「沙盒」讓參與機構在有限範圍和風險可控的情況下，就其擬議的穩定幣應用場景和運作進行試驗。參與「沙盒」並非將來申請穩定幣發行人牌照的先決條件。

此外，政府最近發布了《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》（《政策宣言2.0》），涵蓋推進數字資產應用場景及跨界別合作的政策方向，並闡明探討以穩定幣作支付工具。為展現政府對穩定幣發展的支持及作領頭作用，政府在《政策宣言2.0》廣邀市場參與者就政府測試和利用獲發牌的穩定幣提出建議，例如如何用以提升政府支付的效率。

在發展市場和應用場景的同時，合規地經營業務同樣重要。穩定幣發行人在不同領域需具備充分的配套、關鍵的能力和經驗，例如儲備資產管理及資產的安全保障系統、有效的價格穩定機制和全面可行的贖回政策，還有科技安全、風險管控和反洗錢等方面的能力等。如穩定幣的應用場景牽涉其他地區，牌照申請人必須有整全的合規計劃及足夠資源，確保自身及商業夥伴持有所需牌照，以及在進行穩定幣相關活動時遵守香港及其他地區的相關法規。

（二）財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）和金管局一直就穩定幣的監管和發展與本地和其他地區的持份者，包括潛在穩定幣發行人、市場人士、專業服務提供者等，積極溝通。

隨着《穩定幣條例》即將實施，我們會加緊與世界各地不同持份者聯繫，闡述香港的穩定幣發行人監管框架，強調香港的框架平衡了風險管控和促進行業發展的特點，例如採取了較開放的模式，允許持牌發行人可選擇不同法幣幣種，作為發行穩定幣的錨定法幣。

我們也會繼續透過外訪和日常工作交流着力推廣香港作為國際金融中心的獨特優勢，包括與國際的緊密連結、成熟的金融市場和基礎設施、完善的法律體系，以及大量專業人才等。政府最近發布的《政策宣言2.0》，亦向世界各地的數字資產和相關業界，表明我們銳意將香港構建成全球數字資產中心的堅定決心和政策方向。

（三）香港的穩定幣發行人發牌制度具靈活性和開放性，允許持牌發行人可選擇不同法幣幣種，作為發行穩定幣的錨定法幣。我們歡迎全球不同地方的機構按實際業務需要申請牌照，並會以統一標準審批牌照申請，例如考慮發行人是否符合儲備資產管理、穩定機制、贖回安排和內部管控措施等監管要求。政府和金融監管機構會密切留意不同地區的監管發展，並與各地的監管機構保持溝通。

數字資產市場的發展瞬息萬變。政府會繼續秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，着重風險為本，持續優化和建立一套既切合本地情況，又依循國際標準和慣例的監管制度，促進香港數字資產市場健康、負責任和可持續發展，進一步鞏固香港國際金融中心的地位。

謝謝主席。"
LCQ5: Promoting development of stablecoins,2025-07-02 14:54,2025-07-02 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200429.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Johnny Ng and a reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 The Stablecoins Bill, passed in May this year, aims to establish a licensing and regulatory regime for fiat-referenced stablecoins issuers in Hong Kong. There are views that this marks a milestone in the global development of Web3 and represents an important step in Hong Kong's journey to becoming an international Web3 hub. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of ways to promote the expansion of stablecoin use cases, including fostering connections between stablecoin issuers and application scenarios on the Mainland, so as to facilitate the transition of stablecoins from regulatory compliance to establishment of business ecosystems;

(2) how the Government will leverage the implementation of the Stablecoins Ordinance to promote the openness and flexibility of Hong Kong's stablecoin laws and regulations internationally, while also synergising with Hong Kong's advantages under ""one country, two systems"" as well as its status as an international financial centre which is conducive to stablecoin development, to attract global compliant stablecoin issuers and large-scale international financial institutions to issue stablecoins and establish a presence in Hong Kong; and

(3) whether it will make preparations for the development of offshore Renminbi (RMB) stablecoins, including seeking support from the Central Authorities so as to establish the creditworthiness of Hong Kong's offshore RMB stablecoins?

Reply:

President,

 In May this year, the Legislative Council passed the Stablecoins Bill, establishing a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS) in Hong Kong. The ordinance further strengthens the regulatory framework for digital asset activities in Hong Kong to safeguard monetary and financial stability, as well as consolidates and enhances Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre. The Stablecoins Ordinance will come into effect on August 1 this year, at which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will begin accepting licence applications. Currently, the HKMA is conducting a public consultation on the detailed guidelines for implementing the Ordinance with a view to finalising these guidelines as soon as practicable.

 Having consulted the HKMA, my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) To harness the potential of stablecoins, the Government and regulators will provide a conducive environment and necessary regulatory guidance to enable licensed stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong to explore and implement different stablecoin use cases, with a view to addressing real-world pain points in economic activities, putting forward regulatory priorities for potential risks, and promoting the sustainable development of the market.

 To this end, the HKMA launched the stablecoin issuer sandbox early last year to allow the HKMA to understand the business models of institutions planning to issue FRS in Hong Kong, and to communicate regulatory expectations and provide guidance, while also fostering the development of practical use cases for stablecoins. With both local and global backgrounds, the participating institutions come from a wide spectrum of industries, including cross-border e-commerce and logistics, innovation and technology, banking and telecommunications services. The sandbox enables participants to conduct testing on their proposed use cases and operations within a limited scope and in a risk-controlled environment. Participation in the sandbox is not a prerequisite for licence application in the future.

 Furthermore, the Government recently issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong. It covers the policy direction for advancing digital asset use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and articulates the exploration of stablecoins as a payment tool. To demonstrate the Government's support and to take the lead, in the Policy Statement 2.0 the Government invites proposals from market participants on how the Government may test the usage of licensed stablecoins, for example in enhancing efficiency of Government payments.

 Alongside market and use case development, it is also important to ensure compliance in business operation. Stablecoin issuers must demonstrate adequate setup, capabilities and experience across a range of areas, including management and security of reserve assets, effective price stabilisation mechanisms, comprehensive and feasible redemption policies, as well as capabilities in technological security, risk management, and anti-money laundering. Where the use cases of stablecoins involve cross-border activities, applicants are also expected to develop a comprehensive compliance plan, demonstrate their financial strength, and ensure that they and their business partners have the necessary regulatory approvals and will comply with applicable regulations in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions, when they carry out activities related to their stablecoins.

(2) The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the HKMA have been proactively communicating with stakeholders in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions on the regulation and development of stablecoins, including potential stablecoin issuers, market participants, and professional service providers.

 Along with the upcoming implementation of the Stablecoins Ordinance, we will further enhance our engagement with various stakeholders across the globe to elaborate on Hong Kong's regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, and highlight the balanced approach of our framework in managing risks while promoting industry development, such as adopting a more open model that allows licensed issuers to peg their stablecoins to different fiat currencies for the purpose of stablecoin issuance.

 We will also continue to promote Hong Kong's unique advantages as an international financial centre, including our close connection with the international markets, mature financial market and infrastructure, comprehensive legal system, and a wealth of professional talents, through overseas visits and on-going work exchanges. The Government's recent promulgation of the Policy Statement 2.0 also demonstrates to the digital asset and related sectors around the world our steadfast commitment and policy direction to establish Hong Kong as a global digital asset hub.

(3) The licensing regime for stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong is flexible and open, allowing licensed issuers to peg their stablecoins to different fiat currencies for the purpose of stablecoin issuance. We welcome institutions from around the world to apply for licence based on their actual business needs. We will review licence applications with a set of common standards, such as the issuer's compliance with regulatory requirements in the areas of reserve asset management, stabilisation mechanisms, redemption arrangements and internal control measures. The Government and financial regulators will closely monitor regulatory developments and maintain communications with regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions.

 The digital asset market is developing and evolving rapidly. Guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"" and adopting a risk-based approach, the Government will continue to enhance and establish a regulatory regime that reflects local circumstances and aligns with international standards and practices, with a view to promoting the healthy, responsible and sustainable development of the digital asset market in Hong Kong, thereby further strengthening Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre.

 Thank you, President."
立法會：民政及青年事務局局長就《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》動議二讀發言全文（只有中文）,2025-07-02 14:22,2025-07-02 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200489.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上就動議二讀《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》的發言全文：

主席：

我謹動議二讀《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

政府一貫的政策是不鼓勵賭博。針對賭博問題，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括透過執法打擊非法賭博活動、透過公眾教育宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害、為有需要人士提供輔導和支援服務，以及透過法例規管賭博活動。

在透過法例規管賭博活動方面，政府提供合法賭博途徑的目的，只在於回應市民對某些賭博活動的需求，以免他們轉向非法的經營者下注。

近年有不少社會人士關注香港的非法籃球賭博問題。根據香港賽馬會（馬會）資料，在二○二四年，參與非法籃球博彩的人數約有43萬人，估計的非法籃球博彩收益介乎700億至900億港元，這兩個數字均較二○二三年的數字大幅上升。

為有效打擊非法賭博活動，財政司司長在《財政預算案》宣布，政府將積極探討規範籃球博彩活動。

我們已在今年四月就規範籃球博彩活動的建議方案進行了為期一個月的諮詢。超過九成的回應意見支持規範籃球博彩活動。因此，我們建議修訂《博彩稅條例》（第108章）及相關附屬法例，訂立籃球博彩活動的規管框架。

《條例草案》的主要修訂內容包括：

（一）賦權民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長發出籃球博彩牌照，並定立牌照規限，以減少賭博對市民，尤其是青少年的不良影響；

（二）沿用現行足球博彩稅的計算和徵收方法，即向舉辦商徵收淨投注金的50%作籃球博彩稅；

（三）修訂博彩及獎券事務委員會的職能，以涵蓋籃球博彩牌照的相關事宜。

若《條例草案》獲得通過，我們將會參考現時賽馬和足球博彩的模式，向馬會發出單一籃球博彩牌照，此舉可避免因經營者互相競爭而刺激對賭博的需求。

我們亦會透過一系列牌照條件和監管措施，嚴格監督馬會的籃球博彩業務，確保整個運作符合政府的政策和要求。

在牌照條件方面，我們會沿用現行足球博彩牌照的模式，制定相關條件，以進一步減少賭博對市民的不良影響。主要的牌照條件包括：

（一）民青局局長可為牌照制定有效期；

（二）政府將對投注種類和賽事的數量實施限制；

（三）馬會不得接受有香港球隊參與的賽事，以及在香港舉辦的籃球賽事的投注，以支持在香港推廣不涉賭博的健康籃球體育文化；

（四）馬會不得接受18歲以下人士的投注，亦不得接受信用卡投注。

主席，我明白不少議員和市民都關注規範籃球博彩是否會帶來鼓吹賭風或沉迷賭博的問題。我想在此強調，政府是非常重視預防與賭博相關的問題，尤其是涉及對青少年的影響。

在預防青年沉迷賭博問題方面，我們會進行兩方面的重點工作，包括施加嚴謹的法律與規管約束，以減少賭博對市民的不良影響；以及通過平和基金提供輔導、治療服務、教育和宣傳活動，以提升公眾對沉迷賭博禍害的認識。

其中，雖然青少年參與賭博的比例在過去多年一直維持在低水平，我們仍會增撥資源，在現時資助的四間輔導中心以外，設立專注於為青少年提供輔導及支援服務的新中心，向青少年樹立正確的法律觀和價值觀，特別是通過公眾教育提醒青少年，參與非法賭博，向非法收受賭注者投注已屬違法。

若《條例草案》獲得通過，政府將與馬會、警務處、平和基金諮詢委員會、博彩及獎券事務委員會及其他持份者繼續緊密合作，確保有效落實規管制度。我們已要求馬會增加對平和基金的捐款，以進一步加強平和基金的工作，並繼續完善輔導和支援服務，以積極有為的態度做好並優化預防及緩減與賭博有關問題的工作。我們亦會按需要要求馬會加強推行有節制博彩措施，以進一步減輕沉迷賭博可能造成的影響。

主席，我們已在六月九日的立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會上，就這項立法建議諮詢議員的意見。議員普遍支持建議，並支持政府向立法會提交《條例草案》。

我們會全力配合立法會的審議工作，並懇請各位議員支持《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》。

多謝主席。"

問題：

有意見認為香港擁有多個具本地特色的知識產權項目，當中電影《九龍城寨之圍城》在本地及海外均深受歡迎，於日本更有餐廳推出該電影的周邊產品食物並每天售罊，而不少影迷也因該電影而來港觀光，可見知識產權旅遊蘊含無限商機。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計過去三年受具有本地特色的知識產權項目、文化活動及盛事活動所吸引而訪港的旅客人數，以及其來源地、留港日數及消費金額和模式；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮作出統計；

（二）鑑於有業界人士和學者指出，以單一知識產權主導的旅遊項目難以持續，長遠策略應是串連多個同類型的知識產權，發揮協同效應（例如本港可研究結合《九龍城寨之圍城》及多個經典港產片的知識產權，建設「港版環球影城」，以最大發揮港產片的文化效益），政府有否考慮制訂策略，以促進不同知識產權持有人，以及與旅遊業界的合作；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）政府有否針對知識產權旅遊制訂專項策略，例如加強維護和推廣現有具特色的知識產權項目及相關景點，以及積極推出措施以鼓勵和支援知識產權創作和相關景點建設；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮制訂有關策略？

答覆：

主席：

本屆政府成立文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）推動文化、體育及旅遊融合發展，轄下文創產業發展處（文創處）積極加強對文創業界產業化發展的支援，提供平台促進跨界別、跨文化藝術領域的文化知識產權（IP）合作。我們十分鼓勵業界，例如餐飲、零售、旅遊等利用香港豐富的IP資源，發揮協同效應，吸引旅客和拓展商機。

就林健鋒議員的提問，經諮詢知識產權署，現綜合回覆如下：

香港擁有不少吸引旅客、具本地特色的景點，例如維多利亞港、香港迪士尼樂園、海洋公園、山頂纜車、香港摩天輪、昂坪360等，這些都是充滿香港文化特色的IP。文體旅局及香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）致力善用這些香港文化IP元素以及國際形象推廣旅遊。

二○二四年香港舉行超過240項盛事，共吸引約200萬名旅客參與，當中大部份旅客來自內地及東南亞地區，總共為香港帶來約75億元消費額，以及45億元經濟增加價值。這些盛事包括不少具本地特色，同時善用知名IP，例如「100%多啦A夢&FRIENDS」巡迴特展、Pokémon GO City Safari、PANDA GO！香港遊、ComplexCon 香港、Hypefest Hong Kong、香港動漫電玩節（動漫節），以及「俠之大者—金庸百年誕辰紀念．江湖盛滙」等。二○二五年，我們繼續迎來充滿IP元素的盛事，例如「CHIIKAWA DAYS」大型特展、CR7® LIFE 香港博物館開幕、2025年動漫節、展出眾多本地漫畫作品的「漫眾同樂—幽默港漫格格趣」展覽、香港時裝薈等。

我們透過具吸引力的IP主題活動，豐富旅客的旅遊和玩樂體驗，刺激消費。旅發局積極與盛事活動主辦單位合作，提供全方位支持，包括透過活動帶動本地旅遊。例如「100%多啦A夢&FRIENDS」巡迴特展期間，旅發局與展覽主辦單位合作在香港十個旅遊景點特設「隨意門」，吸引旅客和市民遊覽打卡。旅發局亦在其舉辦的旗艦活動聯乘主題IP，進一步透過結合特色IP推廣旅遊。例如二○二三年和二○二四年香港國際龍舟邀請賽與廣受全球歡迎的IP——LINE FRIENDS合作，沿星光大道特設LINE FRIENDS龍舟打卡點，吸引旅客和市民到訪打卡並投入龍舟盛事。旅客和市民更可在活動期間到限定店購買特別設計的香港限定紀念品。

在利用電影IP推廣旅遊方面，旅發局與電影出品方和有關單位聯手推出「走進香港走進香港電影」九龍城寨之圍城電影展覽，先後於香港國際機場及九龍城啟德AIRSIDE展出。展覽外設有電影周邊商品攤位售賣經典美食、懷舊玩具和電影精品，創造商機。文創處亦在九龍寨城公園舉辦為期三年的「九龍城寨光影之旅」，展示更多電影場景及本土傳統工藝陳設，重現城寨昔日面貌。展覽自今年五月開放以來，首月已吸引超過42000名市民及旅客參觀，帶動附近一帶餐飲和零售業的消費。

在主題公園方面，香港迪士尼樂園作為具豐富IP特色的地標旅遊景點，持續推出多項獨特的設施和活動，吸引旅客，包括已開幕的全球首個及最大型的《魔雪奇緣》主題園區及籌備中的「漫威」主題新園區、20週年慶祝活動、全新彼思主題娛樂體驗等。另外，海洋公園亦把握作為內地以外飼養最多大熊貓地方的優勢，根據六隻大熊貓的外型特徵打造大熊貓商標的設計，並推出具香港特色的相關的大熊貓宣傳活動、商品、文創精品、電子遊戲及旅遊產品等。除了廣泛應用大熊貓IP於公園的社交媒體內容及產品外，公園會繼續利用相關IP於園內推出以大熊貓主題節慶及沉浸式體驗活動、光影匯演、主題表演、遊樂設施等，亦會繼續與不同合作機構合作，推廣相關IP。

另外，文創處透過「創意智優計劃」（「計劃」）資助和推動多個融合本地動漫文化和旅遊的IP項目，包括資助業界為期兩年的「動漫體育大本營」，展示36個不同年代融入運動元素的本地原創動漫角色聯乘運動造型，例如老夫子配對桌球、石黑龍配對拳擊、契爺與牛仔配對乒乓球，呼應巴黎奧運會和全國運動會，推動香港文體旅融合的創新體驗。自二○二四年七月開幕至今，項目已吸引約46萬名市民及旅客到訪。以香港原創漫畫為主題的香港漫畫星光大道過去累計吸引超過300萬人次參觀。項目亦於二○二四年底加強和更新，展出100位漫畫家合共76個本地漫畫角色的彩繪塑像如王小虎、華英雄和麵包哥哥、50米長的大型漫畫牆及互動裝置，半年間超過85萬名參觀者，其中約四成為訪港旅客。年度盛事動漫節匯聚來自本地、內地和海外的動漫、手機／電腦遊戲和潮玩創作，每年吸引約25萬人次包括內地及海外旅客參觀。二○二五年的動漫節中有四個項目，包括「香港國際潮玩博覽」、「國際漫畫家大會及展覽」、「漫畫大師匯香港」及「港漫動力—香港漫畫支援計劃展館」，除了展出過百件香港、內地和海外潮玩和漫畫作品，還會舉辦多場漫畫大師分享會和工作坊。文創處會加強宣傳，吸引內地及海外旅客參觀。

在維護和強化IP保障層面，特區政府持續推動本地IP（包括文化IP）的發展，優化本地IP制度，確保制度與時並進、緊貼國際發展趨勢並切合香港經濟需要，包括實施加強數碼環境版權保護的《2022年版權（修訂）條例》，全面檢視本地註冊外觀設計制度並計劃於今年內展開公眾諮詢。完善的IP保護制度可激勵本地文創產業持續發展，更有助帶動包括旅遊業在內的相關產業鏈，促進經濟連鎖發展。文創處亦透過「計劃」積極支援文化IP項目，包括與旅遊有關項目，並推動申請機構為文創產品進行IP保護的申請、制定IP協議和管理IP組合等，以協助創作者開拓商機。

知識產權署透過製作和發布宣傳品及宣傳片，推廣尊重創意及保護IP的訊息，同時致力推行「正版正貨承諾」計劃及「我承諾」行動，向本地零售商、遊客及消費者宣揚售賣和購買正版貨的訊息。「正版正貨承諾」計劃多年來廣受本地商戶支持，每年平均有超過1500個零售商及7000個銷售點／網上商店參與。

特區政府會繼續以創新思維，結合科技、動漫、演藝和影視文化等優勢，支援IP創作、建設、聯乘，吸引更多旅客來港體驗本地獨特文化內涵，亦期望餐飲、零售、旅遊等業界好好利用IP項目發掘商機，共同落實「無處不旅遊」。"
LCQ11: Developing tourism projects with distinctive intellectual properties,2025-07-02 14:22,2025-07-02 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200381.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Jeffrey Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

There are views that Hong Kong has a number of intellectual property (IP) projects with local characteristics, among which the film ""Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In"" has been well received both locally and overseas. In Japan, a restaurant has even launched peripheral food products inspired by the film, which sell out every day. Moreover, many film fans have visited Hong Kong for sightseeing due to the film, demonstrating the unlimited business opportunities of IP tourism. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of visitors attracted to Hong Kong by IP projects, cultural events and mega-events with local characteristics in the past three years, as well as their places of origin, length of stay in Hong Kong, and consumption amounts and patterns; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will consider compiling such statistics;

(2) as some members of the industry and academics have pointed out that tourism projects dominated by a single IP are difficult to sustain, and that the long-term strategy should be linking up multiple IPs of the same type to create synergy effects (e.g. Hong Kong can explore combining the IP of ""Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In"" and those of a number of classic Hong Kong films to build a ""Hong Kong version of Universal Studios"", with a view to maximising the cultural benefits of Hong Kong films), whether the Government has considered formulating a strategy to promote collaboration between different IP holders and the tourism industry; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the Government has formulated a dedicated strategy for IP tourism, such as strengthening the protection and promotion of existing distinctive IP projects and related attractions, and actively introducing measures to encourage and support IP creation and the development of related attractions; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will consider formulating relevant strategies?

Reply:

President,

The current Government has established the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) to promote the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism. The Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) under the CSTB proactively strengthens its support towards the industrialisation development of the cultural and creative industries and provides a platform to foster cross-sectoral and cross-genre collaborations among cultural and creative sectors for cultural intellectual property (IP). We fully encourage industries such as catering, retailing and tourism to make use of the rich IP resources in Hong Kong to achieve synergy, attract tourists and explore business opportunities.

My reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Jeffrey Lam's question, in consultation with the Intellectual Property Department (IPD), is as follows:

There are a number of attractions in Hong Kong with local characteristics and tourism appeal, such as Victoria Harbour, the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort (HKDL), the Ocean Park (OP), the Peak Tram, the Hong Kong Ferris Wheel, Ngong Ping 360. They are also IPs with strong Hong Kong's cultural characteristics. The CSTB and the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) have been striving to promote tourism by making good use of these cultural IPs and the international image of Hong Kong.

In 2024, Hong Kong hosted over 240 mega events, attracting about two million visitors from mainly the Mainland and Southeast Asia region, and bringing a total spending of about HK$7.5 billion and added value of about HK$4.5 billion to the economy. Many of these mega events featured local characteristics and made good use of well-known IPs, such as the ""100% DORAEMON & FRIENDS"" Tour, Pokémon GO City Safari, PANDA GO! FEST HK, ComplexCon Hong Kong, Hypefest Hong Kong, Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong (ACGHK), and ""A Path to Glory - Jin Yong's Centennial Memorial • The World of Wuxia"", etc. In 2025, we continue to welcome events filled with IP elements, such as ""CHIIKAWA DAYS"" Exhibition, the opening of CR7® LIFE Museum Hong Kong, ACGHK 2025, ""Comic Fun for All: The Magic of Hong Kong Comedy Comics"" showcasing various local comics and Hong Kong Fashion Fest.

We have been making use of attractive IP-themed events to enrich visitors' travel and entertainment experience and stimulate spending. The HKTB proactively collaborates with event organisers to provide all round support, including driving local tourism through events. For example, during ""100% DORAEMON & FRIENDS"" Tour, the HKTB partnered with the exhibition organiser to present ""Anywhere Door"" at ten tourist spots in Hong Kong, attracting visitors and locals to explore the city and take photos. The HKTB also collaborates with IPs in flagship events and integrates with signature IPs to further promote tourism. For example, in organising the Hong Kong International Dragon Boat Races in 2023 and 2024, the HKTB collaborated with the world's popular IP, LINE FRIENDS, to set up LINE FRIENDS dragon boat photo spots along the Avenue of Stars to attract visitors and locals to take photos and enjoy the races. Both visitors and locals could also purchase Hong Kong-exclusive merchandise designed for the races during the event period.

In terms of tourism promotion through leveraging movie IPs, the HKTB collaborated with the movie producer and relevant units to launch a movie exhibition titled ""Live out the Cinematic Charm of Hong Kong"" Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In. The exhibition was first staged at the Hong Kong International Airport and then AIRSIDE at Kai Tak, Kowloon City. In parallel, merchandise vendors on site offered classic dishes, nostalgic toys and movie merchandise to create business opportunities. The CCIDA also organises the three-year ""Kowloon Walled City: A Cinematic Journey"" Movie Set Exhibition at the Kowloon Walled City Park, showcasing more movie sets and local traditional craftsmanship displays, recreating scenes of the Walled City. Over 42000 locals and tourists were attracted in the first month since its opening in May this year, driving catering and retailing spending in the vicinity.

In terms of theme parks, the HKDL, a landmark attraction with rich IP features, has been introducing various unique facilities and events to attract visitors, including the opening of the world's first ever and largest Frozen-themed land, the new Marvel-themed area under planning, the 20th anniversary celebration and an all-new Pixar entertainment experience. On the other hand, the OP, capitalising on its advantage of being home to the largest number of giant pandas outside the Mainland, has created the giant pandas' IPs according to the physical traits of the six giant pandas and launched giant panda-related promotional activities, merchandise, cultural and creative products, video games, tourism products, etc, with Hong Kong's characteristics. In addition to the extensive use of the giant pandas' IPs in OP's social media content and merchandise, the OP will continue to make use of the relevant IP to launch giant panda-themed festive events, immersive experience activities, light shows, thematic performances, amusement facilities, etc, and partner with different organisations to promote the IPs.

Separately, the CCIDA, through the CreateSmart Initiative (CSI), has funded and promoted various IP projects that integrate local animation and comic culture with tourism. These include the two-year AniCom Sports Park which showcases 36 locally created AniCom characters from different eras, each paired with a sports-themed design, such as ""Old Master Q"" with snooker, ""Dragon Shik"" with boxing and ""My Boy"" with table tennis, echoing the Olympic Games Paris and the National Games to promote the innovative experience of integrating culture, sports and tourism in Hong Kong. Since its launch in July 2024, the project has attracted about 460000 locals tourists. The Hong Kong Avenue of Comic Stars, with the theme of local original comics, has drawn over three million visitors to date. The project was enhanced and updated in late 2024, now featuring 76 coloured figurines of local comic characters created by 100 artists, such as ""Wang Xiao Hu"", ""Hero Wah"" and ""MinBao Gor"", along with a 50-meter-long large-scale comic wall and interactive installations. In half a year, it attracted over 850000 visitors with approximately 40 per cent of them being tourists. The annual mega event, the ACGHK, brings together comics and animation, mobile/computer games and art toy creations from Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, attracting about 250000 tourists from the Mainland and overseas annually. The ACGHK 2025 will feature four projects, namely the Hong Kong International Art Toys Expo, the International Comic Artist Conference and Exhibition, the Comics Masters Gathering Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Comics Support Programme Pavilion. Apart from showcasing over 100 art toys and comic works from Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, there will also be sharing sessions and workshops led by comic masters. The CCIDA will strengthen publicity in order to attract visitors from the Mainland and overseas.

On upholding and strengthening IP protection, the Government continues to drive the development of local IP (including cultural IP), enhance the local IP regime, ensuring that it keeps abreast of the times, aligns with international trends, and meets Hong Kong's economic needs, including the implementation of the Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2022 to strengthen copyright protection in the digital environment, and a comprehensive review of the local registered designs regime and plans to launch a public consultation within this year. A robust IP protection regime can foster the sustainable development of local cultural and creative industries, as well as help drive the growth of related industry chains, including tourism, thereby spurring the development of the economy. The CCIDA is also actively supporting cultural IP projects, including those related to tourism, through CSI, and driving applicants to make applications for IP protection for their cultural and creative products, formulate IP agreements and manage IP portfolios, etc, so as to assist creators in exploring business opportunities.

The IPD advocates for the messages of respecting creativity and IP protection through producing and disseminating promotional materials and videos. At the same time, it is committed to implementing the ""No Fakes Pledge"" Scheme and the ""I Pledge"" Campaign to encourage the selling and buying of genuine goods among local retailers, tourists and consumers. The ""No Fakes Pledge"" Scheme has garnered widespread support from local businesses over the years, with an average annual participation of over 1500 retail merchants and 7000 outlets/online shops.

The Government will continue to support IP creation, construction and cross-over through innovative thinking, combining with our edges in technology, animation and comics, the performing arts, film and television culture to attract more tourists to come to Hong Kong to experience the unique local cultural connotation. We also hope that the catering, retailing and tourism industries can make good use of IP projects to explore business opportunities and implement the concept of ""tourism is everywhere in Hong Kong"" together."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;

立法會三題：推動民宿發展,2025-07-02 12:35,2025-07-02 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200411.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，今年五一黃金周僅約百分之六十六的內地旅客留港過夜，是與住宿費用昂貴及種類選擇較少有關，政府應善用鄉郊的天然資源發展民宿，以延長旅客留港日數。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據報日本近年放寬民宿規管，側重管理要求，而非如酒店及賓館般對其硬件設施實施嚴格規範，政府有否研究循此方向規管民宿；若有，詳情為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，香港有很多兼具天然美景及民宿發展潛力的鄉郊地點（例如貝澳及梅窩），政府會否研究讓位於該等地點並已獲發合約完成證明書（俗稱「滿意紙」）的村屋自動獲得民宿經營資格，以減省申辦民宿的行政程序；若會，時間表為何；及

（三）據報有位於鄉郊的私房菜館申請食肆牌照時遇到頗大困難，政府會否因應鄉郊特殊情況而放寬規定，並主動協助兼營食肆的鄉郊民宿統一辦理牌照，以加快民宿發展步伐？

答覆：

主席：

就陳學鋒議員三個部分的提問，經諮詢發展局和環境及生態局後，現綜合回覆如下：

民政事務總署轄下牌照事務處（牌照處）負責《旅館業條例》（第349章）（《條例》）的發牌及執法工作。《條例》的目的是確保擬用作酒店或賓館的處所，在樓宇及消防安全方面達到法定標準，以保障入住者及公眾的安全。此外，由於旅客通常都只在晚間或較少時間逗留在酒店或賓館，未必清楚有關處所的逃生路徑，因此有必要制訂合理程度的安全要求，以保障旅客的安全。現行制度下，任何提供短期收費住宿的處所，包括酒店、賓館或所謂「民宿」，都必須符合《條例》訂明的樓宇和消防安全標準，方能獲發牌照營業。《條例》並無針對「民宿」作出特別規限或排除，只要經營模式符合酒店或賓館的定義，無論是位於市區還是鄉郊，均可申領牌照經營。

牌照處一貫以靈活務實的態度，處理所有牌照申請，促進持牌處所的營運。在審批酒店及賓館牌照申請時，牌照處會確保申請處所達到基本安全要求，例如樓宇和消防安全，同時考慮該處所的規模和運作模式。此外，處所還需符合《條例》的相關規定，以保障入住者及公眾的安全，並兼顧處所所在大廈其他業主的權益。這些規定大部分是二○二○年修訂條例引入的規定，包括無使用限制規定，即申請牌照的處所所在大廈的公契中或地契中不可包含任何相關限制性條文；以及經營、開設或管理酒店或賓館的人士須為適當人選等，申請過程不會因屬「民宿」形式而加設額外限制。牌照處在收到牌照申請後，會派員到有關處所進行實地視察，根據個別處所的情況制訂適用的發牌要求。政府一直以保障公眾安全視為首要考慮，同時致力於促進業界的健康發展。在確保旅客、處於同一幢大廈內其他人士及公眾安全的前提下，牌照處會積極便利牌照申請和審批。

目前新界小型屋宇的土地契約一般容許非工業用途，即包括用作旅館用途，因此只要小型屋宇獲地政總署發出合約完成證明書（俗稱完工證）或不反對佔用書，不用再走程序去改契，但仍須申請旅館牌照方可營辦旅館，以保障入住者及公眾的安全。

然而，我們明白鄉郊地區的村屋有其獨特情況和限制。牌照處一向以靈活和務實的方式處理相關申請，並因應個別情況讓申請人提出替代方案，只要能確保樓宇及消防安全，便可獲批牌照。在不影響公眾安全的前提下，對於鄉郊和古舊村屋的申請，相關部門會因地制宜，協助申請人配合牌照要求。

截至二○二五年五月三十一日，本港已有108間位於新界或離島的鄉郊村屋獲牌照處發出賓館牌照。

事實上，為促進生態旅遊、利便訪客和協助活化荒僻村落，政府跨部門工作小組因應偏遠鄉郊地區的獨特性，為現時位於新界偏遠鄉郊、沒有車路連接的90多條鄉郊村落制訂一系列便利賓館及食物業牌照申領過程的優化措施，涵蓋城市規劃、土地、消防安全、樓宇安全及衞生方面等不同範疇。現時，已有位於荔枝窩的賓館、鹽田梓的外賣店和谷埔的餐廳，根據相關優化措施取得有關的牌照。政府正根據這些真實案例，梳理優化措施的要求、細節和執行步驟，並將匯編成一套《申請指引》，以供有意營運者參考。政府會持續檢視鄉郊地區賓館及食物業牌照申領過程的優化空間，為鄉郊地區締造更友善的營商環境，支持鄉郊保育和活化的工作。

在跨部門協作機制下，荔枝窩11間村屋已於二○二一年十二月至二○二二年九月期間成功獲發首批賓館牌照。

多謝主席。"

答覆：

主席：

非物質文化遺產（非遺）是中華優秀傳統文化的重要組成部分，是中華文明綿延傳承的生動見證。文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）及康樂及文化事務署（康文署）一直致力保護、傳承和推廣香港非遺，積極配合國家推進非遺保護的工作方針，推行加強保護非遺的措施，因應不同範疇的非遺項目深化在確認、立檔、研究、保存、推廣和傳承等多方面的工作，以提高公眾對非遺的認識，鼓勵社會共同參與保護非遺。有關工作包括康文署的非遺資助計劃，支持合資格的本地團體和個人推行具意義的本地非遺計劃。此外，康文署於二○二四年十二月公布更新的香港非遺代表作名錄及香港非遺清單，非遺代表作名錄項目由20個增至24個，非遺清單項目則由480個增至507個。

按二○二四年《施政報告》中提出的兩項推動非遺保護和傳承的措施，康文署轄下的非遺辦事處於二○二五年制定香港非遺代表作名錄項目傳承人的認定機制和準則，並於每年六月舉辦「香港非遺月」。

就吳議員問題的三個部分，我分別回覆如下：

（一）首屆「香港非遺月」於二○二五年五月三十一日至七月一日圓滿舉行，活動包括超過80場非遺表演、60個非遺互動體驗攤位和24個「非遺精華遊蹤」活動，涵蓋超過100項非遺項目。應康文署的邀請，超過20個社區團體參與籌辦當中的活動，增加「香港非遺月」在社會的覆蓋力和滲透力。

截至二○二五年六月二十一日，首屆「香港非遺月」的參與人次已超過八萬五千，預計總參與人次超過10萬。雖然沒有具體的旅客比例數字，但首屆「香港非遺月」的開幕禮及非遺嘉年華選擇在旅客眾多的尖沙咀香港文化中心露天廣場舉行，適逢內地端午節的長周末假期，吸引了不少旅客參與這場非遺嘉年華。其中「非遺精華遊蹤」約有三分一的名額給予境外旅客，旅客的反應非常正面，康文署日後會繼續在這方面作嘗試，加強文旅融合。各項活動的參與人次詳見我們提供的附件。

首屆「香港非遺月」成功凝聚社會對香港和內地非遺的認識，透過政府與民間組織的協作，以及本地和內地非遺團體及工作者的積極參與，讓市民及旅客感受到「香港處處有非遺」。

（二）康文署已研究了國家關於非遺代表性傳承人的認定與管理辦法，並完成蒐集和了解廣東省、澳門等鄰近地區在規劃、制定和執行認定傳承人或團體的相關資料，涵蓋當地的認定機制、管理制度及傳承人取消機制等。目前，國家的管理辦法有涵蓋取消機制，而廣東和澳門也有各自適用的取消機制。康文署會參考上述資料，並因應香港非遺傳承的實際狀況，擬備符合香港情況的方案，包括申請傳承人或團體要遵守的要求、認定機制和準則，以及適用的取消機制。康文署會就所草擬的方案諮詢非遺諮詢委員會的意見，確保訂定一套嚴謹和適用於香港情況的認定機制和準則，以有效認定高質素及致力傳承非遺的傳承人或團體，增強保護和傳承香港非遺。我們預期於今年內公布有關香港非遺傳承人的認定機制和準則。

（三）至於非遺文化IP（知識產權）方面，非遺辦事處近年積極協助本港文化及創意產業品牌，推出文藝創意商品。例如自二○二四年起與本地時裝品牌合作，讓香港非遺元素以嶄新的方式呈現，為時尚愛好者帶來一系列活化傳統的新派長衫，以及以非遺元素創作的服飾。除了在香港開展宣傳推廣，亦會透過在香港以外的地方，例如倫敦、上海及深圳，舉行時裝表演展示香港非遺。非遺辦事處會繼續為合適的文化及創意產業品牌，提供非遺資訊，協助他們將非遺活化為可增值的文創產品。

此外，文體旅局轄下文創產業發展處透過「創意智優計劃」資助及推動本地文創業界與非遺傳承人聯乘合作，在本地、內地及海外文創展覽或活動中推廣香港非遺，以及支援香港設計師以非遺為題材創作文創產品，宣傳香港非遺同時促進文創業界產業化發展。這些項目包括二○二四年十一月深圳讀書月及二○二五年四月香港悅讀周期間舉行「故宮館藏x香港非遺」展覽；二○二五年六月在北京國際圖書博覽會設立以「漫步香港：非遺與城市記憶」為主題的香港館；以及將於二○二五年十一月舉行的「香港原創潮玩展2025@吉隆坡」展出香港原創潮玩設計師，以香港非遺為題材創作的全新潮玩等。"
"LCQ22: Development of ""Zero Waste Bay Area""",2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200375.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 It is learnt that the Government is exploring with other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to take forward the development of ""Zero Waste Bay Area"", and that Guangdongand Hong Kong will tackle waste management issues through regional strategies and enhance regional recycling of recyclable materials in the GBA by leveraging each other's competitive advantages and complementing strengths. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific work directions and strategies of the Special Panel for Building ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" established by the governments of Guangdongand Hong Kong in January this year, and the latest progress of its work;

(2) given the opportunities arising from the ""Zero Waste Bay Area"", how will the Government capitalise on Hong Kong's advantage of connecting the country with the world to facilitate the development of green industries and a circular economy in the GBA, and whether it has assessed the difficulties and challenges that may arise in the process; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the HKSAR Government has started to explore the arrangements for the cross-boundary transportation of waste to other Mainland cities in the GBA, such as the mode of transport (i.e. sea or land) and daily handling capacity; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

(1) According to the ""Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Ecological Environmental Protection Plan"" promulgated by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government continuously works with the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) to develop a ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" and explore regional co-operation models for achieving ""Zero Waste City"". The Special Panel for Building ""Zero Waste Bay Area"" (the Special Panel) was established by Guangdong and Hong Kong at the Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection and Combating Climate Change meeting held in January this year, serving as a standing mechanism for advancing solid waste management and resources circulation co-operation between the two places, thereby strengthening policy co-ordination, technical exchanges and project collaboration, as well as elevating the capability in jointly handling solid waste.

 The first meeting of the Special Panel, held on March 27 this year, was co-chaired by the Environmental Protection Department of the HKSAR Government and the Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province. It mainly focused on exploring strategies leveraging on the complementary advantages of the region, to promote resources circulation of recyclable materials in the GBA and foster collaborative development of green industries and related facilities through deepening the collaboration by a joint ""project-based"" model. At present, the Special Panel has commenced initial discussions on topics such as regional co-operation in resources circulation and waste management policy, and is actively discussing how to promote the co-ordination of regulations and market integration between the two places.

(2) and (3) The co-operation direction with the Mainland cities of the GBA is to promote resources circulation through the joint development of ""Zero Waste City"", instead of transferring the municipal solid waste (MSW) to the Mainland cities of the GBA for treatment.

 Under the co-operation framework of the Special Panel, Hong Kong will fully capitalise on our distinctive advantage of having strong support of the Motherland and being closely connected to the world to further deepen the co-operation with other Mainland cities of the GBA in areas such as developing a ""Zero Waste City"" and promoting resources circulation. Hong Kong will introduce advanced recycling technologies and large-scale industrial expertise from the Mainland on one hand; and integrate its international market environment with its mature environmental management system to jointly explore the development pathway of a regional circular economy on the other. For example, the paper pulping facility and the retired electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling facility currently under construction in EcoPark, Tuen Mun, both incorporate mature Mainland technologies to process local waste paper and retired EV batteries. This not only strengthens Hong Kong's role in the regional green industry chain, but also fosters collaborative development of green technologies and mutually beneficial co-operation in the environmental industry of the GBA.

 As for the local treatment of MSW in Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government is pressing ahead with the development of a network of advanced and highly efficient modern waste-to-energy facilities. The first modern incineration facility for treating MSW currently under construction near Shek Kwu Chau, IâPARK1, will commence operation within this year. In addition, the HKSAR Government is pushing forward the development of IâPARK2 at full steam. The open tender for the project was invited in last December and will close on July 18 this year. We will seek funding from the Legislative Council for the project in a timely manner."
LCQ1: Sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage,2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200331.htm,"  âFollowing is a question by the Hon Stanley Ng and a reply by the Under Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Mr Raistlin Lau, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

  There are views that the first Hong Kong Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) Month held last month enabled members of the public and tourists to experience the vitality and charm of Hong Kong's ICH, and that transmitting ICH skills and the economic benefits brought about by the related cultural and creative intellectual property rights (IP) are conducive to the sustainable development of Hong Kong's ICH. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of participants or visitors to the various activities of the first Hong Kong ICH Month, and the proportion of travellers among them; whether an assessment has been conducted on the effectiveness of Hong Kong ICH Month;

(2) as it has been reported that the Government will announce a system for designating Hong Kong ICH bearers this year, whether the system will cover designation for both categories of bearer and bearer organisation; whether a mechanism will be established to revoke the status of bearers, ensuring that ICH remains vibrant and relevant over time, as well as maintaining the vitality of the transmission system and the enthusiasm of bearers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as it is learnt that the rapid development of IP of ICH in the Mainland has generated considerable economic benefits, of the mechanism put in place by the Government to regularly follow up on, incubate, support, protect and compile statistics on cultural and creative IP projects derived from Hong Kong's ICH, so that they can sustainably create cultural value and economic benefits?

Reply:

President,

  Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) is an essential part of the fine traditional Chinese culture, and a lively witness to the continuous transmission of Chinese culture. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) are committed to safeguarding, transmitting and promoting the ICH of Hong Kong, while actively supporting the national policies on furthering the safeguarding of ICH and implementing enhanced measures. Targeting ICH items across various domains, different aspects of work such as identification, documentation, research, preservation, promotion and transmission of ICH are strengthened to enhance the public's understanding of ICH and engage the community in safeguarding ICH. The above work includes the ICH Funding Scheme of the LCSD, which supports eligible local organisations and individuals in implementing meaningful local ICH projects. In addition, the LCSD released in December 2024 the updated Representative List of the ICH of Hong Kong (Representative List), with an increase in its number of items from 20 to 24, and the updated ICH Inventory of Hong Kong, with an increase in its number of items from 480 to 507.
  
  The 2024 Policy Address proposed two measures to promote the safeguarding and transmission of ICH, whereby the LCSD will develop a mechanism and criteria in 2025 for recognising the bearers of the items on the Representative List, as well as organise the Hong Kong ICH Month in June every year.
  
  In response to the Hon Stanley Ng's three-part question, my replies are as follows:

(1) The inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month was successfully held from May 31 to July 1, 2025. Activities include over 80 ICH performances, 60 interactive experiential booths on ICH and 24 field trips under ""ICH Highlight Tours"", covering more than 100 ICH items. By invitation of the LCSD, over 20 community organisations participated in organising activities during the Hong Kong ICH Month so as to expand the coverage of the event and extend its reach in the community.

  With the attendance of the activities of the inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month already surpassing 85 000 as at June 21, 2025, the final total attendance of the event is estimated to be more than 100 000. Despite the unavailability of figures on the percentage of visitors, since the tourist-filled Piazza of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui was chosen as the venue of the opening ceremony and the ensuing ICH carnival of the inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month, and both activities fell on the Mainland's long weekend holiday in celebration of the Tuen Ng Festival, many visitors were attracted to the ICH carnival. Among others, around one-third of the ""ICH Highlight Tours"" quotas were given to visitors, and their feedback was very positive. The LCSD will continue to make efforts in this area in the future to enhance the integration of culture and tourism. A breakdown of the attendance of the Hong Kong ICH Month 2025 by activity is set out at Annex.
  
  The inaugural Hong Kong ICH Month successfully enriched the public's understanding of the ICH items of both Hong Kong and the Mainland. Through the collaboration between the Government and community organisations, as well as the active participation of local and Mainland ICH organisations and practitioners, the public and visitors were provided with an experience of ""ICH Around Town"".

(2) The LCSD has studied the national guidelines for the recognition and management of ICH bearers. It has also completed its collection of and gained insight into relevant information on the planning, formulation and implementation of the mechanism for recognising ICH bearers or bearer organisations, the management system and the cancellation mechanism for the recognised ICH bearers or bearer organisations, etc in Guangdong Province, Macao and other neighbouring regions. Currently, the national guidelines include a cancellation mechanism, while Guangdong and Macao also have their own relevant cancellation mechanisms. The LCSD will take into account the aforementioned information and consider the current transmission of Hong Kong's ICH to prepare a proposal that is in accord with the actual situation of Hong Kong. The proposal will cover the requirements for applicants for the status of ICH bearer or bearer organisation to follow, the mechanism and criteria for recognition, as well as a cancellation mechanism where applicable. The LCSD will consult the ICH Advisory Committee on the draft proposal to ensure that a set of stringent recognition mechanism and criteria suitable for Hong Kong is formulated to effectively recognise high-quality bearers or bearer organisations that are committed to transmitting ICH, thereby enhancing the protection and transmission of Hong Kong's ICH. The mechanism and criteria are expected to be promulgated within this year.

(3) As regards intellectual property based on ICH, the ICH Office has actively assisted cultural and creative industry brands in Hong Kong in launching creative cultural merchandise in recent years. For example, it has co-operated with a local fashion brand since 2024 to present Hong Kong's ICH elements in a novel way to bring fashion lovers a series of new-style cheongsams that revitalise traditions, and clothing created with ICH elements. In addition to a publicity and promotional campaign launched in Hong Kong, fashion shows were organised in places outside of Hong Kong, such as London, Shanghai and Shenzhen, to showcase Hong Kong's ICH. The ICH Office will continue to provide information on ICH for suitable cultural and creative industry brands to assist them in transforming ICH into value-‍added cultural and creative products through revitalisation.

  Furthermore, the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency under the CSTB, through the CreateSmart Initiative, provides funding support and drives to foster cross-sectoral collaboration between local cultural and creative industries and ICH bearers, promote Hong Kong's ICH at cultural and creative exhibitions and events staged in Hong Kong, the Mainland and overseas, and support Hong Kong designers to create cultural and creative products themed on ICH. These collaborations promote the ICH of Hong Kong, as well as facilitate the development of cultural and creative sectors as industries. Examples include the ""Palace Museum Collections x Hong Kong Intangible Cultural Heritage"" Exhibition held during the Shenzhen Reading Month in November 2024 and the Hong Kong Reading Week in April 2025, the Hong Kong Pavilion themed ""Strolling through Hong Kong: Intangible Cultural Heritage and Urban Memories"" set up at Beijing International Book Fair in June 2025, and the Hong Kong's ICH-themed new art toys created by Hong Kong original art toy designers to be showcased in the ""Hong Kong Art Toy Story 2025@Kuala Lumpur"" in November 2025."
立法會二十二題：建設「無廢灣區」,2025-07-02 12:25,2025-07-02 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200374.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上陳月明議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉政府正與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）其他內地城市探討推進「無廢灣區」建設，而粵港兩地會以區域性策略處理廢物管理問題，透過優勢互補，加強推動大灣區可回收物料的區域性循環利用。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）粵港政府於本年一月成立的「無廢灣區」建設專題小組的具體工作方向和策略，以及最新的工作進度為何；

（二）在「無廢灣區」的機遇下，政府將如何發揮香港內聯外通的優勢，促進發展大灣區綠色產業和循環經濟，以及有否評估當中可能出現的困難和挑戰；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）特區政府是否已開始探討跨境運送廢物往大灣區其他內地城市的安排，例如運輸方式（即海路或陸路）和每日處理量；如是，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆︰

主席︰

（一）根據國家生態環境部印發的《粵港澳大灣區生態環境保護規劃》，香港特別行政區政府與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市持續建設「無廢灣區」，探索「無廢城市」區域共建模式。粵港雙方已於今年一月舉行的粵港環保及應對氣候變化合作小組會議，成立「無廢灣區」建設專題小組（專題小組），作為兩地推進固體廢物管理與資源循環合作的固定機制，以加強政策對接、技術交流與專案協作，提升固體廢物協同處置能力。

專題小組已在今年三月二十七日召開首次會議，由香港特別行政區政府環境保護署與廣東省生態環境廳聯合主持，重點探討以區域優勢互補策略，推動大灣區可回收物料的資源化利用，並通過「項目化推進落實」模式深化合作，共同發展綠色產業和相關設施。目前，專題小組已就區域性資源循環合作、廢物管理政策等議題展開初步討論，並正積極商討推動兩地法規協調和市場對接。

（二）及（三）我們與大灣區內地城市的合作方向，是透過共同建設「無廢城市」推動將廢物轉為資源循環利用，而不是轉移都市固體廢物送往大灣區內地城市處理。

在專題小組的合作框架下，香港將充分發揮背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，進一步深化與其他大灣區內地城市在共同建設「無廢城市」和資源循環利用等領域的合作。一方面引入內地先進的回收處理技術與規模化產業經驗，另一方面結合香港國際化市場環境與成熟的環保管理體系，共同探索區域性循環經濟的發展路徑。例如，正在屯門環保園興建的紙漿生產設施和退役電動車電池回收設施，皆引進內地成熟技術處理本地廢紙和退役電動車電池，既提升香港在區域綠色產業鏈的角色，也促進大灣區綠色科技的協同發展和環保產業互利合作。

至於香港本地的都市固體廢物處理，特區政府正全力發展先進高效的現代轉廢為能設施網絡。第一座在石鼓洲旁建設中的現代垃圾焚化設施I∙PARK1將於今年內開始運作。此外，特區政府正全力推進發展I∙PARK2，工程項目已於去年十二月開展公開招標，並將於今年七月十八日截標，我們會適時就工程向立法會申請撥款。"

胡文新主席（香港冰球訓練學校兼香港業餘冰球會主席）、朱劍平處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部體育處處長）、各位嘉賓、各位教練、各位冰球員、各位朋友：

大家早上好。很高興今日來到將軍澳這個冰場為全港十八區青少年冰球錦標賽主持開幕禮。

剛才看了一會比賽，我已經看見大家充滿朝氣與活力的年輕臉孔。冰球是一項講求節奏、速度和控球技巧的高強度運動。在冰面上高速滑行、傳球和射門，不但考驗球員的體能，還需要機智與判斷，電光火石之間就決定了勝負。

體育活動在社區的普及，實有賴各界鼎力支持和參與。全港青少年地區冰球發展計劃已推行接近二十年，與超過300多間學校合作，為約44 000多名青少年提供培訓。我衷心感謝香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會的教練和團隊，本着他們自己對冰球運動的熱誠，不遺餘力推動這項運動，並成功培育了不少有潛質的青少年球員。

值得一提的是，過去一年，在Thomas（胡文新）的帶領下，香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會為全港14個地區的學校籌組了17支青少年冰球隊，進行常規訓練，並協助當中五間學校在校內設立仿真溜冰場，其中一間學校更把冰球運動納入其校本體育本科。香港冰球訓練學校與香港業餘冰球會在推廣冰球運動方面的努力與建樹，大家有目共睹。

今日，來自不同地區的球員齊集在真雪溜冰場，互相較量，是展現辛苦訓練成果的好機會。我鼓勵大家全力以赴，盡情發揮，好好享受比賽的過程，並從中汲取經驗，不斷精益求精。

最後，我謹祝全港十八區青少年冰球錦標賽圓滿成功，各位球員有出色的發揮。多謝大家。"

問題：

關於密閉空間工作的安全與健康，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於《密閉空間工作的安全與健康工作守則》（《守則》）在去年作出修訂，加入東主或承建商須在工作期間於密閉空間出入口拍攝視頻等要求，自《守則》修訂至今，當局巡查了多少個涉及密閉空間作業的工作地點，以及巡查期間有否發現東主或承建商違反《守則》的行為；如有，該等行為的主要性質，以及當局就該等行為發出的書面警告、暫時停工通知書和敦促改善通知書，以及提出檢控的數目為何；該等檢控個案中，被定罪個案數目和所涉判罰為何；

（二）鑑於職業安全健康局（職安局）推出「密閉空間安全工作資助計劃2.0」（資助計劃），︀以資助合資格中小企購買氣體測試設備及動態感應器等，︀過去三年及本年至今，資助計劃每年可供申請的名額上限、職安局接獲、批准及拒絕的申請個案數目為何，並按企業業務性質（例如渠務、建築及機電工程等）列出分項數字；獲批申請的平均資助額（按新申請企業和曾獲資助企業列出），以及不獲批申請的主要原因為何；

（三）鑑於職安局推出「職安健星級企業—密閉空間安全認可計劃」（認可計劃），為從事密閉空間工作的企業提供職安健顧問服務及資助購買安全裝備等，過去三年及本年至今，︀職安局每年就認可計劃接獲、批准及仍在審批中的企業申請數目為何，︀並按企業業務性質（例如渠務、建築及機電工程等）列出分項數字；獲批申請的平均資助額為何；

（四）當局就調查去年四月二十二日於沙田源禾路發生涉及沙井的致命工業意外肇因的進展為何，以及有否向須就意外負責人士提出檢控；如有，詳情為何；

（五）據報當局去年表示研究能否在清洗渠管合約加入條款，訂明若本來不預計進入沙井工作的工人需入井工作，須事先通知渠務署並獲得該署批准，有關工作的進展為何；

（六）鑑於根據政府於二○二二年六月提交本會人力事務委員會的文件，勞工處與負責渠務工程的主要政府部門／法定機構（包括香港機場管理局、房屋署、路政署和渠務署）已建立通報系統，該等政府部門／法定機構會向勞工處通報需要工人進入密閉空間進行渠務或地底喉管工作的日期和時間，以便勞工處按風險為本策略進行突擊巡查，自通報系統建立至今，每年該等政府部門／法定機構向勞工處通報的工程數目，以及當中勞工處進行巡查的工程數目為何，並按通報政府部門／法定機構列出分項數字；該等巡查中，有否發現承建商違反《守則》及／或相關職安健法例（包括《工廠及工業經營（密閉空間）規例》（第59AE章）、《工廠及工業經營條例》（第59章）及《職業安全及健康條例》（第509章））的個案；如有，詳情為何，包括個案數目和性質，以及當局的跟進行動，並按通報的政府部門／法定機構列出分項資料；及

（七）會否考慮設立密閉空間工作強制呈報機制，要求承建商在開展較高風險的密閉空間工程前須先呈報，以便當局安排針對性巡查，加強確保前線工友的工作安全？

答覆：

主席：

就周小松議員的提問，經諮詢渠務署後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（六）勞工處不時巡查全港工作場所，以保障工人工作時的安全及健康。由於巡查密閉空間工作是勞工處日常進行職安健巡查的一部分，因此勞工處沒有專就這類工作場所分項備存巡查地點和相關執法數字。然而，自二‍○二二年起，勞工處與主要負責渠務工程的政府部門和法定機構（包括渠務署、房屋署、路政署和香港機場管理局）建立通報機制，這些部門／機構會定期向勞工處通報需要工人進入密閉空間進行渠務或地底喉管工作的日期和時間，以便勞工處按風險為本策略，選擇有較高風險的密閉空間工作進行突擊巡查和加強執法。自通報機制建立至今年五月，勞工處共收到8 608次通報，並進行780次巡查。相關的通報和巡查數字載於附件一。

在突擊巡查密閉空間工作時，勞工處人員會檢視相關工序及設備，例如有否進行風險評估及有否執行相應的風險控制措施、工人是否符合培訓及相關工作經驗的要求、進行地底喉管工作的工人有否配戴認可的呼吸器具及適當的安全吊帶等。此外，自二○二四年十一月三十日修訂版《密閉空間工作的安全與健康工作守則》生效後，勞工處人員會特別留意東主或承建商有否按照守則採取相關措施，包括在工作期間於密閉空間的出入口拍攝視頻，加強保障工人的職安健。過去三年，勞工處就通報系統而進行的突擊巡查共向相關東主或承建商發出13份敦促改善通知書及136封警告信。這些違規事項主要涉及未有進行全面的風險評估、發出不完整的許可工作證明書及未有正確使用認可的呼吸器具等。相關的執法分項數字載於附件二。

（二）職安局於二○二二年六月推出「密閉空間安全工作資助計劃2.0」，資助中小企購買合適的安全設備，包括氣體測試設備及動態感應器，並免費提供相關的訓練課程及一站式風險評估。計劃旨在協助中小企提升密閉空間工作安全水平，特別是沙井、污水渠、喉管等工作環境，預防意外。該計劃的詳情及相關統計數字載於附件三。

（三）職安局於二○二二年推出「職安健星級企業—密閉空間安全認可計劃」，旨在為從事密閉空間工作（例如沙井、污水渠、壓力容器／鍋爐、隧道、喉管、水缸）的企業，提供度身訂做的免費職安健顧問服務、培訓課程及資助購買安全裝備，並為職安健表現達到一定水平的企業認證，致力協助業界提升工作安全健康水平，並協助業主或場地管理者識別職安健表現較佳的承辦商。企業成功通過職安局認證後會成為「密閉空間職安健星級企業」，可獲列入星級名冊讓用家識別。該計劃的相關統計數字載於附件四。

（四）勞工處高度關注二○二四年四月二十二日晚在沙田源禾路遊樂場發生涉及渠務工程的致命工作意外。勞工處已迅速完成調查，經徵詢律政司意見後，根據《工廠及工業經營條例》（第59章）及其附屬規例，向有關承建商及分判商提出共43項檢控，有關案件現已進入司法程序。

（五）在上述於沙田源禾遊樂場發生致命意外後，渠務署隨即停止所有清洗污水渠工作並詳細檢視有關的工作流程。渠務署分別於在二○二四年五月三十一日及六月二十八日更新其密閉空間工作相關的實務備考及合約條款，訂明工程如初時預計無須派員進入密閉空間（包括沙井）工作，但後來發現必須派員進入，承建商須立即暫停有關工程、通知渠務署，並按密閉空間工作守則，在完成風險評估和實施相關的安全措施及獲得渠務署批準後，才可進入該密閉空間工作。

（七）除上文所述勞工處與主要負責渠務工程的政府部門和法定機構建立的通報機制之外，勞工處亦已於二零二四年修訂《密閉空間工作的安全與健康工作守則》，並加強相關的宣傳及教育，提升業界的職安健意識。此外，按上述守則作出修訂的密閉空間作業強制性安全訓練課程亦已於二○二四年十一月三十日推行，進一步提升相關工作的安全水平。我們會繼續採取多管齊下的策略，加強巡查執法、宣傳推廣及教育培訓，預防意外發生。"
LCQ8: Safety and health at work in confined spaces,2025-07-02 11:36,2025-07-02 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200281.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chau Siu-chung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 Regarding safety and health at work in confined spaces, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces (CoP) was revised last year by adding, among others, the requirement for proprietors or contractors to record videos at the entrance and exit of the confined spaces throughout the entire work period, of the number of work sites involving confined space operations that have been inspected since the revision of the CoP, and whether any violations of the CoP by proprietors or contractors have been identified during the inspections; if so, of the main nature of such violations, and the numbers of written warnings, suspension notices, and improvement notices issued in response to such violations, as well as the number of prosecutions initiated; among these prosecutions, of the number of convictions and the penalties imposed;

(2) given that the Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) launches the ""OSH Enhancement Scheme for SMEs for Safe Work at Confined Space 2.0"" (Enhancement Scheme) to subsidise eligible small and medium enterprises for purchasing equipment such as gas detectors and man-down alarm devices, of the number of application quotas available under the Enhancement Scheme and the numbers of applications received, approved, and rejected by the OSHC in each of the past three years and this year to date, with a breakdown by nature of business of the enterprise (e.g. drainage services, construction, and mechanical and electrical engineering); of the average amount of subsidy for the approved applications (set out by new applicants and enterprises previously subsidised), and the main reasons for applications being rejected;

(3) given that the OSHC launches the OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme (Accreditation Scheme) to provide enterprises specialising in confined space work with, among others, occupational safety and health (OSH) consultancy service and subsidies for purchasing safety equipment, of the numbers of enterprise applications received, approved, and currently under vetting by the OSHC under the Accreditation Scheme in each of the past three years and this year to date, with a breakdown by nature of business of the enterprise (e.g. drainage services, construction, and mechanical and electrical engineering); of the average amount of subsidy for the approved applications;

(4) of the progress of the investigation to identify the causes of the fatal industrial accident involving a manhole that occurred on Yuen Wo Road in Sha Tin on April 22 last year, and whether prosecution has been initiated against those held liable for the accident; if so, of the details;

(5) as it is reported that the authorities indicated last year that they would study the possibility of including clauses in sewer cleaning contracts to stipulate that if workers who are originally not supposed to enter a manhole subsequently need to do so, the Drainage Services Department must be informed and its approval had to be obtained in advance, of the progress made in this regard;

(6) given that according to a paper submitted by the Government to the Panel on Manpower of this Council in June 2022, the Labour Department (LD) has established a notification system with key government departments/statutory bodies responsible for drainage works (including the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the Housing Department, the Highways Department and the Drainage Services Department), under which these government departments/statutory bodies will notify the LD of the date and time of all their drainage works or underground pipeworks that require workers to enter confined spaces, so as to facilitate surprise inspections by the LD as appropriate according to a risk-based strategy, of the number of works notified by these government departments/statutory bodies in each year since the establishment of the notification system, and the number of these works that have been inspected by the LD, with a breakdown by the notifying government department/statutory body; during these inspections, whether there are any cases where contractors were found to have violated the CoP and/or relevant OSH legislation (including the Factories and Industrial Undertakings (Confined Spaces) Regulation (Cap. 59AE), the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance (Cap. 59), and the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (Cap. 509)); if so, of the details, including the number of cases and their nature, as well as the follow-up actions taken, with a breakdown by the notifying government department/statutory body; and

(7) whether it will consider establishing a mandatory reporting mechanism for work in confined spaces, requiring contractors to report prior to commencing higher-risk work in confined space, so as to facilitate the authorities to arrange targeted inspections to enhance the safety of frontline workers?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the Drainage Services Department (DSD), my consolidated reply to the Hon Chau Siu-chung's question is as follows:

(1) and (6)The Labour Department (LD) conducts inspections of workplaces across the territory from time to time to ensure the safety and health of workers at work. As inspection of work in confined space is an integral part of the LD's routine occupational safety and health inspection, the LD did not specifically keep separate statistics on the number of routine inspection for such workplaces and related enforcement statistics. However, the LD has established a notification mechanism with key Government departments and a statutory body (including Drainage Services Department (DSD), Housing Department, Highways Department and the Airport Authority Hong Kong) responsible for drainage works since 2022. These parties will notify the LD regularly of the date and time of all their drainage works or underground pipeworks that require workers to enter confined spaces so as to facilitate the LD to select those confined space works with higher risk for surprise inspection and enhanced enforcement actions according to a risk-based strategy. Since the establishment of the notification mechanism to May 2025, the LD received a total of 8 608 notifications and conducted 780 inspections. The relevant notification and inspection figures are at Annex 1.

  During surprise inspections of confined space work, the LD personnel will review the relevant procedures and equipment, such as whether risk assessments have been conducted and whether corresponding risk control measures have been implemented, whether workers meet the requirements of training and relevant work experience, and whether workers engaged in underground pipeworks are wearing approved breathing apparatus and appropriate safety harnesses. In addition, since the revised ""Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces"" came into effect on November 30, 2024, the LD personnel will pay particular attention to whether proprietors or contractors have implemented relevant measures in accordance with the Code, including recording videos at the entrances and exits of confined spaces while at work to further protect the occupational safety and health of workers. In the past three years, the LD has issued a total of 13 improvement notices and 136 warning letters to proprietors or contractors in the surprise inspections of workplaces that were notified to the LD through the notification system. The main irregularities involved failure to conduct comprehensive risk assessments, issuance of incomplete work permits, and failure to properly use approved breathing apparatus, etc. The relevant enforcement figures are at Annex 2.

(2)The Occupational Safety and Health Council (OSHC) launched the ""OSH Enhancement Scheme for SMEs for Safe Work at Confined Space 2.0"" in June 2022 to subsidise small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in purchasing appropriate safety equipment, including gas detectors and motion-sensing alarm devices, providing free relevant training courses and offering one-stop risk assessments. The scheme aims to help SMEs enhance safety standards in confined space work, particularly in workplaces such as manholes, sewers, and pipelines, and prevent accidents. Details of the scheme and related statistics are at Annex 3.

(3)The OSHC launched the OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme in 2022. This scheme aims to provide tailor-made free OSH consultancy services, training courses, and subsidies for purchasing safety equipment to enterprises that have work conducted in confined spaces (such as manholes, sewers, pressure vessels/boilers, tunnels, pipelines, and water tanks). It also certifies enterprises that achieve a certain level of occupational safety and health performance, helping the industry to raise the standard of safety and health at work. Additionally, it facilitates owners or site managers to identify contractors with better occupational safety and health performance. Enterprises that successfully pass OSHC certification will become OSH Star Enterprise - Confined Space and be listed in the OSH Star Enterprise List – Confined Space Safety Accreditation Scheme for users' reference. Relevant statistics for the scheme are at Annex 4.

(4)The LD is highly concerned about the fatal work accident involving drainage works that occurred at Yuen Wo Road Playground in Sha Tin on the night of April 22, 2024. The LD has completed the investigation swiftly. Having consulted the Department of Justice, the LD has initiated a total of 43 prosecutions against the relevant contractor and subcontractor under the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance (Cap. 59) and its subsidiary regulations. The case is now under judicial proceedings.

(5)After the aforementioned fatal accident in Yuen Wo Playground in Sha Tin, the DSD immediately suspended all sewer cleansing work and conducted a detailed review of the relevant work procedure. The DSD updated its practice note and contract provisions related to work in confined space on May 31, 2024 and June 28, 2024, respectively. It is now stipulated that if a workers' entry into a confined space (including manhole) was not expected in project initially but it is found later that such entry is necessary, the contractor must immediately suspend the relevant work and notify the DSD. The contractor shall complete a risk assessment and implement necessary safety requirements in accordance with code of practice of confined space work, and obtain approval from the DSD before entering the confined space to carry out work.

(7)In addition to the above-mentioned notification mechanism established between the LD and the key Government departments and the statutory body responsible for drainage works, the LD also revised the Code of Practice for Safety and Health at Work in Confined Spaces in 2024 and strengthened related publicity and education to raise occupational safety and health awareness within the industry. In addition, the mandatory safety training courses for confined space operations, revised in accordance with the aforementioned Code, was also launched on November 30, 2024, to further enhance the safety standards of related work. We will continue to adopt a multi-pronged strategy, including strengthening inspections and enforcement, publicity and promotion, as well as education and training, to prevent accidents."
立法會十三題：輸入體育專才,2025-07-02 11:22,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200288.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據報近年先後有多位國際及內地體壇名將透過優秀人才入境計劃（優才計劃）或高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）來港發展或定居。有意見認為本港具備匯聚體育人才的優勢，政府應進一步協助來港發展的體育專才，以推動本港體育產業的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年有多少名海外及內地運動或體育專才分別透過優才計劃及高才通計劃申請來港發展，以及當中獲批的個案宗數為何，並按專才所參與的運動項目列出分項數字；有否統計，獲批個案專才在港的就業情況；

（二）體育專才透過優才計劃或高才通計劃來港後，香港人才服務辦公室會如何跟進他們在港的發展和需要（包括曾為該等專才提供的支援服務及發展策略（如有））；

（三）據報過去一年有多位國際知名的桌球運動員先後透過優才計劃成為香港居民，當局會否考慮展開深化工作，協助該等桌球運動員在港推廣桌球或發展桌球事業，例如開辦桌球室或訓練班等，以帶動香港成為「國際桌球之都」；及

（四）會否考慮優化優才計劃或高才通計劃，或提供誘因（例如為短期或長期來港的一些國際體壇名將或體育專才提供稅務優惠），以吸引更多國際體育人才來港發展？

答覆：

主席：

為打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地，政府正推行各項不同定位的人才入境計劃，積極招攬多元背景的人才來港，建立優質人才庫以配合香港發展所需。

其中，優秀人才入境計劃（優才計劃）下的「成就計分制」旨在吸引具備超凡才能或技術並擁有傑出成就的人士來港定居，申請人須曾獲得傑出成就獎（例如奧林匹克運動會獎牌、諾貝爾獎、國家／國際獎項），或者可證明其工作得到同業肯定或對所屬界別的發展有重大貢獻（例如有關行業的終生成就獎），才符合「成就計分制」的申請資格。成功獲批的人士一般首次入境可獲准在港逗留八年。過往，絕大部分曾在大型運動賽事獲獎並已來港發展的國際及內地體壇名將，均透過上述渠道獲批來港。

就議員的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局及入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年），優才計劃下成功通過甄選程序的獲批個案中，共有42名退役或現役運動員按「成就計分制」獲批來港，包括不同運動項目的奧林匹克運動會獎牌得主、亞洲運動會獎牌得主，以及其他國際體育賽事的得獎者。

由於高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）旨在吸納高收入或全球頂尖學府學士畢業的人才，入境處並不掌握來自退役／現役運動員的申請數目。

經優才計劃或高才通計劃來港的人士無須在來港前已在港覓得工作。在首個簽證有效期間，人才如在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，亦無須通知入境處。高才通計劃的獲批申請人在提出延長逗留期限申請時，須向入境處提供可信納的資料及文件，證明已在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，方可獲得續簽。入境處沒有備存上述兩個計劃下獲批申請人剛來港時的就業情況，以及提問涉及的其他分項統計數字。

（二）香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）自二○二三年十月三十日成立以來，一直以線上及線下形式，為不同人才入境計劃（包括優才計劃及高才通計劃）下來港／留港的人才提供全方位一站式支援。除設有線上平台（www.hkengage.gov.hk）提供有關在港生活及工作的全方位資訊，以及處理人才的查詢外，人才辦與合作夥伴舉辦多元化的線上線下活動，包括招聘會、專題研討會、工作坊（包括粤語學習班），以及社區共融活動（包括人才義工計劃），提供有關不同生活範疇、就業及創業等方面的資訊，協助來港人才落戶香港，以及盡快融入香港生活。線上平台連繫約90家指定合作夥伴，提供網上支援配對服務，在求職、住房、教育、綜合移居、銀行及保險服務、商務及企業服務和社群網絡等方面為人才提供建議和服務。

早前，不少國際知名的體育專才（如世界排名第一的桌球手卓林普（Judd Trump）及前美國職業籃球聯賽球員馬布里（Stephon Marbury））落戶香港，人才辦即邀請他們參與宣傳，親身分享來港的原因，對外宣傳及推廣香港的獨特優勢和發展機遇，吸引更多國際多元人才來港發展。

（三）多位國際知名的桌球運動員來港定居，帶動市民對桌球運動的關注與興趣。政府會積極推動本地桌球運動的發展，與來港發展的桌球名將保持聯繫，並在他們有需要時提供適切支援，攜手促進本地桌球運動的發展。

政府一直致力推動體育發展，積極落實普及化、精英化、盛事化、專業化和產業化五大政策目標。在推廣體育普及化方面，政府透過舉辦多元化的康樂體育活動，鼓勵市民參與，在社區建立熱愛體育的文化，協助他們培養健康生活模式。

政府亦會繼續投放資源，拓展熱愛體育（包括桌球運動）的觀眾群，並透過「M」品牌計劃支援主辦機構舉辦大型體育活動。今年三月，大型體育活動事務委員會向「世界格蘭披治桌球大獎賽2025」頒授「M」品牌認可。這項大賽首次在英國以外的地方舉行，不但有助推動本地桌球發展，而且彰顯香港作為國際體育盛事之都的地位。

（四）香港需要來自各行各業和具備不同技能的人才，難以為所有經優才計劃或高才通計劃來港發展的人才提供財政誘因或稅務優惠。香港在「一國兩制」下，擁有得天獨厚的優勢，既有祖國的強大支持，又與世界緊密相連。此外，香港亦擁有世界一流的營商環境、簡單的低稅制、高度開放的國際化市場等制度優勢，為香港的發展奠定了堅實的基礎。這些優勢也讓香港成為人才尋求個人成長和自我提升的理想之地，他們可以將創新理念付諸實踐，為世界帶來積極的改變。許多專業人士也選擇以香港為基地，探索內地的發展機遇。相關政策局和部門會繼續與行業的持份者保持緊密聯繫，了解行業最新發展及人力需求情況，持續完善招攬人才措施，例如為重點吸納從事特定行業的外來人才，提供針對性的支援。"
LCQ13: Admission of sports professionals,2025-07-02 11:22,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200290.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Vincent Cheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 It has been reported that in recent years, several international and Mainland sports stars have come to Hong Kong for development or settlement one after another through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) or the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS). There are views that Hong Kong possesses the advantage of attracting sports talent, and the Government should further assist sports professionals coming to Hong Kong for development, so as to promote the development of Hong Kong's sports industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of overseas and Mainland sports professionals who have applied over the past five years for coming to Hong Kong for development through QMAS and TTPS respectively, and among them, the number of applications approved, together with a breakdown by the sports disciplines in which the professionals are involved; whether it has compiled statistics on the employment status of professionals in Hong Kong in the approved cases;

(2) when sports professionals have come to Hong Kong through QMAS or TTPS, how the Hong Kong Talent Engage will follow up on their development and needs in Hong Kong (including support services and development strategies (if any) provided to such professionals);

(3) as it has been reported that several world-renowned billiard players have become Hong Kong residents one after another through QMAS over the past year, whether the authorities will consider launching further initiatives to assist these billiard players in promoting billiards or developing their careers in billiards in Hong Kong, such as opening billiard saloons or training programs, so as to help Hong Kong become an ""international billiard hub""; and

(4) whether it will consider optimising QMAS or TTPS, or providing incentives (such as providing tax concessions to international sports stars or sports professionals coming to Hong Kong on a short-term or long-term basis), so as to attract more international sports talent to come to Hong Kong for development?

Reply:

President,

 To build Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent, the Government has been implementing various talent admission schemes with different positioning to proactively trawl for talent with diversified backgrounds to come to Hong Kong to build a quality talent pool for meeting Hong Kong's development needs.

 Among them, the Achievement-based Points Test (APT) under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) aims to attract individuals with exceptional talents or skills, as well as outstanding achievements, to come to Hong Kong for settlement. To be eligible for APT, the applicant must have received an award of exceptional achievement (e.g. Olympic medal, Nobel prize, national/international award) or can show that his/her work has been acknowledged by his/her peers or have contributed significantly to the development of his/her field (e.g. lifetime achievement award from industry). Successful applicants will normally be granted a stay of eight years upon first entry. In the past, the majority of international and Mainland sports celebrities who had won awards in major sports events and had come to Hong Kong for development were admitted through the above channel.

 Our reply to the Member's questions, in consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), is as follows:

(1) In the past five years (from 2020 to 2024), among the approved cases that have successfully passed the selection exercise under theQMAS, a total of 42 retired or serving athletes have been approved to come to Hong Kong under theAPT, including Olympic medalists, Asian Games medalists, and winners of other international sports events.

 As the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) aims to attract individuals with high income or full-time bachelor's degree from top universities/institutions around the world, the ImmD does not have the number of applications from retired/serving athletes.

 Persons admitted to Hong Kong under the QMAS or the TTPS are not required to have secured offers of employment before coming to Hong Kong. During the validity period of the first visa, the talent are not required to inform the ImmD when they are employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong. When applying for extension of stay, successful applicants under the TTPS are required to provide the ImmD with concrete supporting information and documents to prove that they have been employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong so that an extension of stay can be granted. The ImmD does not maintain statistics on the employment situation of successful applicants under the above two schemes when they first arrived in Hong Kong, as well as other statistical breakdowns mentioned in the question.

(2) Since its establishment on October 30, 2023, Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) has been providing comprehensive one-stop support to talent coming to / staying in Hong Kong under the various talent admission schemes (including theTTPS and theQMAS) through both online and offline means. Apart from providing comprehensive information on living and working in Hong Kong as well as handling enquiries from outside talent through its online platform (www.hkengage.gov.hk), HKTE organises with working partners a variety of online and offline activities such as job fairs, themed seminars, workshops (including Cantonese learning classes) and social integration activities (including Talent+ Volunteer Programme) to share information on entrepreneurship, employment as well as other living tips and to help the incoming talent to settle in Hong Kong and integrate into the city as soon as possible. The online platform is connected to about 90 designated working partners of HKTE to provide recommendations and services in areas such as job seeking, accommodation, education, integrated settlement, banking and insurance, business and corporate services as well as networking and community, through online matching tools.

 Earlier on, many internationally renowned sports professionals (such as Judd Trump, the world's number one snooker player, and Stephon Marbury, former National Basketball Association (NBA) player) have settled in Hong Kong. HKTE has invited them to participate in promotional activities to give first-hand sharing of their reasons for coming to Hong Kong, thereby promoting Hong Kong's unique strengths and development opportunities to attract more global talent with diverse backgrounds to pursue development in Hong Kong.

(3) Several internationally renowned snooker players have settled in Hong Kong, drawing public attention and interest for the sport. The Government will actively promote the development of local billiard sports, maintain connections with top snooker players pursuing development in Hong Kong, and provide appropriate support when needed to foster the development of billiard sports in Hong Kong together.

 The Government is committed to sports development through the five policy objectives of promoting sports in the community, supporting elite sports, maintaining Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events, enhancing professionalism, and developing sports as an industry. For the promotion of community sports, the Government organises various types of recreation and sports activities and encourages public participation to cultivate a strong sporting culture in the community, helping them develop a healthy lifestyle.

 The Government will continue to devote resources to expand the audience base of sports enthusiasts (including snooker fans) and support the organisation of major sports events through the ""M"" Mark System. The Major Sports Events Committee awarded the ""M"" Mark status to the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 in March this year. It was the first time for the event to be held outside the United Kingdom. In addition to promoting the development of billiard sports in Hong Kong, the event also underlines Hong Kong's status as the centre for major international sports events.

(4) Hong Kong needs talent from various industries with diverse skills. It is difficult to provide financial incentives or tax benefits to all kinds of talent coming to Hong Kong for development under theQMAS or theTTPS. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is bestowed with unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of our motherland and being closely connected to the world. In addition, Hong Kong has a strong foundation for success, with institutional strengths such as a world-class business environment, a simple and low tax system, and a highly open and internationalised market. All these strengths make Hong Kong an ideal place for talent looking for personal growth and self-enhancement, as they can bring their innovative ideas to life and make positive changes to the world. Many professionals also choose to base in Hong Kong to explore development opportunities in Mainland China. Relevant bureaux and departments will continue to stay in close touch with industry stakeholders to understand the latest developments and manpower needs of the industries, and continuously improve the measures to trawl for talent, such as providing targeted support with a view to attracting outside talent engaged in specific industries."
立法會十八題：沙田車公廟的管理,2025-07-02 11:10,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200284.htm,"​以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上李世榮議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見認為沙田車公廟（車公廟）作為重要歷史文化廟宇，具有深厚的歷史底蘊和廣泛的社會影響力。關於該廟的管理，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於根據華人廟宇委員會（委員會）的資料，車公廟截至去年三月三十一日止的年度盈餘超過1,600萬元，政府是否知悉，該盈餘所擬作的具體用途為何，包括會否撥入《華人廟宇條例》（第153章）下的華人慈善基金或用於沙田區的社區項目；

（二）是否知悉就車公廟相關的重大決策（例如擴建工程及廟內的服務收費調整等），委員會如何徵詢善信或文物保護團體的意見，以及有否定期舉行公開會議或備存諮詢紀錄；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）是否知悉委員會有否制定車公廟未來10年的發展戰略，包括應對遊客流量增長、提供數碼化服務（例如使用電子祈福平台）或推行環保措施（例如減少香燭污染）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

華人廟宇委員會（委員會）是根據《華人廟宇條例》（第153章）（《條例》）成立的法定機構。現時共有約350間廟宇向委員會註冊或由委員會以不同方式管理。沙田車公廟（車公廟）是由委員會管理的其中一間直轄廟宇。

就李世榮議員的提問，現回覆如下：

根據《條例》的規定，委員會轄下所有直轄廟宇（包括車公廟）的收入須先撥入華人廟宇基金，而非由各直轄廟宇的司祝自行決定收入的用途。華人廟宇基金主要用於進行傳統儀式，以及廟宇建築物及其財產的維修等用途。舉例而言，委員會曾在相關資助計劃下撥款資助沙田鄉事委員會九約建醮委員會舉辦沙田鄉事委員會九約十年一屆乙巳年太平清醮，以及資助沙田鄉事委員會舉辦參拜車公活動等。華人廟宇基金的盈餘則可撥入同樣由委員會管理的華人慈善基金，供本港華人慈善活動用途，包括撥款予民政事務總署用作緊急援助金，以幫助受天災或意外影響的本港華人，以及設有華人慈善基金撥款資助計劃，資助本港的華人慈善活動及計劃。華人廟宇基金的盈餘用途也受《條例》規範，同樣也不是由各直轄廟宇的司祝決定。

委員會及其轄下的工作小組會就委員會轄下廟宇（包括車公廟）的運作及相關事宜提供建議。其中，委員會轄下設有工程小組，就委員會轄下廟宇工程的規劃、管理及相關事宜進行討論，並向委員會呈交建議。就廟宇維修工作等事宜而言，委員會會按需要諮詢相關持份者，例如若廟宇屬法定古蹟的話，委員會會諮詢古物古蹟辦事處的意見。委員會的會議不作公開，故相關文件也不會公開。

委員會一直密切留意與廟宇相關的整體發展，致力在各方面與時俱進，以符合到訪各直轄廟宇（包括車公廟）的善信及遊客的需要。舉例而言，委員會就其轄下的六間法定古蹟廟宇印製了法定古蹟廟宇神祇明信片，並在相關廟宇設置壓印，鼓勵善信或遊客到訪收集。委員會亦一直推動數碼化服務，例如近年在車公廟內設立數碼金榜題名顯示屏，並在近月維修及重髹車公廟車公神像期間，引入裸眼3D技術，展示車公元帥的影像。此外，在推行環保措施方面，委員會亦致力在其直轄廟宇引入環保設施，例如淨煙處理系統、環保化寳爐等。"
LCQ18: Management of Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin,2025-07-02 11:10,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200291.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

There are views that the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin, being an important historical and cultural temple, has a profound history and extensive social influence. Regarding the management of the temple, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that according to the information provided by the Chinese Temples Committee, the annual surplus of the Che Kung Temple for the year ended March 31 last year exceeded $16 million, whether the Government knows the intended specific uses of the surplus, including whether it will be transferred to the General Chinese Charities Fund under the Chinese Temples Ordinance (Cap. 153) or used for community projects in Sha Tin District;

(2) whether it knows, in respect of major decisions relating to the Che Kung Temple (e.g. the expansion project and the adjustment of fees for services provided in the temple), how the Committee seeks the views of worshippers or heritage conservation groups, and whether the Committee has held open meetings or kept records of such consultations on a regular basis; if the Committee has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it knows if the Committee has formulated development strategies for the Che Kung Temple for the next 10 years, including coping with the growth in visitor flow, providing digitalised services (e.g. using a platform for electronic blessings) or implementing environmental protection measures (e.g. reducing the pollution caused by joss sticks); if the Committee has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Chinese Temples Committee is a statutory body established in accordance with the Chinese Temples Ordinance (Cap. 153). At present, there are around 350 temples registered with the Committee or managed by the Committee through different means. The Che Kung Temple, Shatin, is one of the administered temples under the Committee.

I give the reply in response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li as follows:

According to the Ordinance, all revenues from the administered temples under the Committee (including the Che Kung Temple) must first be transferred to the Chinese Temples Fund (CTF). The temple keepers of individual administered temples do not have the authority to determine the use of these revenues. The CTF is primarily used for the purposes of organising customary ceremonies and the maintenance of the temple buildings and temple properties and so on. For instance, the Committee has granted fundings under relevant funding schemes to the Ta Chiu Festival Committee of Kau Yeuk of the Sha Tin Rural Committee for organising the decennial Ta Chiu Festival in the Year of Yisi, and to the Sha Tin Rural Committee for organising the Che Kung worshipping event. Any surpluses from the CTF may be transferred to the General Chinese Charities Fund (GCCF), also managed by the Committee, for the purposes of any Chinese charity in Hong Kong. It includes grants to the Home Affairs Department for provision of emergency financial relief to needy persons of Chinese race who are affected by natural disasters or accidents, as well as the GCCF funding scheme supporting charitable activities and projects for the Chinese community in Hong Kong. The use of surpluses from the CTF is also governed by the Ordinance and is not subject to the discretion of the temple keepers of individual administered temples.

The Committee and its working groups render advice on matters relating to the operations of its administered temples (including the Che Kung Temple). Specifically, the Works Working Group under the Committee discusses matters relating to the planning and management of its temples, and submit recommendations to the Committee. For temple maintenance and related matters, the Committee would consult relevant stakeholders as appropriate. For example, the Committee would seek advice from the Antiquities and Monuments Office on works for administered temples under the Committee that are declared monuments. The Committee's meetings are not open to the public, and related documents are therefore not disclosed to the public.

The Committee has all along been keeping abreast of the overall development of temple-related matters, striving to keep up with the times to meet the needs of worshippers and visitors of its administered temples (including the Che Kung Temple). For example, the Committee has made postcards for its six administered temples that are declared monuments and installed debossing stations at these temples for collection by worshippers and visitors. The Committee has also been actively promoting digital services, such as installing a digital wishing board display at the Che Kung Temple in recent years. Besides, during the recent maintenance and repainting of the Che Kung statue, the Committee has introduced naked-eye 3D technology to project images of Che Kung. Furthermore, in respect of environmental protection measures, the Committee is committed to implementing green facilities at its administered temples, including smoke filtration systems and eco-friendly joss paper burners and so on."
申訴專員三大策略性方向取得成果　為市民帶來實際裨益（附圖）,2025-07-02 11:00,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200300.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出︰

陳積志說︰「我在去年四月一日履新後，為公署制定了三個策略性方向：（一）積極以調解方式有效和快速地處理市民的申訴；（二）促進跨部門及跨機構的協作，提供高效優質的公共服務；以及（三）在社會層面推動正面和積極的申訴文化。這三個策略性方向旨在提升公共行政質素，為市民帶來實際裨益，同時鼓勵政府和市民共同建設更穩定和諧、不斷進步的社會。」

在年度內，公署成功調解了555宗申訴，接近上年度的三倍，佔已跟進個案的33.5%，刷新了公署的紀錄。而以調解方式結案的申訴個案平均僅需時10.87天，顯著加快為市民紓困排憂。

在促進跨部門跨機構協作方面，在年度內，公署完成了三宗涉及跨部門及機構協作的主動調查行動及成功處理了141宗涉及跨部門及機構協作的個案。

公署全力宣揚「正面看申訴」這個理念，在年度內，除了每年的申訴專員嘉許獎計劃外，亦向16個部門和機構發出共41封嘉許信，以及向申訴人致送了19張感謝狀，以表揚他們對改善公共行政的貢獻。公署亦首次為大學、大專院校舉辦講座，全年為大學和中學舉辦了共13場「正面看申訴」講座。公署正積極籌備成立香港國際申訴專員學院，為政府部門及公營機構提供適切的培訓，提升公署員工的專業能力，並且促進公署與海外申訴機構的交流和合作。

公署在年度內完成了八項主動調查行動及40個全面調查個案，合共提出了254項改善公共行政的建議，較去年建議的總數增加了37%，建議全數獲相關政府部門或機構接納，部分建議亦已獲跟進及落實。由二○二四年十一月起，公署亦對以查訊方式完成處理的個案提出觀點，點出已實行的改善措施或可從速改善之處。截至二○二五年三月三十一日，公署提出了106項觀點均獲相關政府部門和公營機構接納。

公署在本年度接到4 402宗涉及不同課題的申訴個案，並完成處理了4 664宗（連同由上一年度轉入的個案），當中3 009宗經評審後結案，以及1 655宗已跟進並結案。

Ombudsman's three strategic focuses deliver results and tangible benefits to community (with photo),2025-07-02 11:00,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200298.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (July 2) presented the 2024-25 Annual Report of The Ombudsman to the public. The Office exceeded all its service targets in handling enquiries, complaints, reassessment and review of complaints in the reporting year.

  Mr Chan said, ""Since assuming office on April 1 last year, I have championed three strategic focuses: (1) enhancing mediation to effectively and swiftly resolve public complaints; (2) fostering interdepartmental collaboration to provide highly efficient and quality public services; and (3) cultivating a positive and proactive complaint culture within the community. These three initiatives are designed to improve the quality of public administration, deliver tangible benefits to our citizens, and encourage the Government and citizens to foster a more stable, harmonious and progressive society for all.""

  In the reporting year, the Office concluded an all-time high of 555 cases by mediation, nearly tripling the number of the previous year and accounting for 33.5 per cent of the cases pursued. Given that the average time taken to resolve a complaint by way of mediation was only 10.87 days, it significantly expedited the process of redressing grievances for the public.

  On the front of fostering interdepartmental collaboration, the Office completed three direct investigation operations and processed 141 complaint cases during the year in this connection.

  The Office has stepped up efforts to cultivate a positive complaint culture. In addition to the annual Ombudsman's Awards Scheme, the Office issued 41 appreciation letters to 16 departments and organisations, and presented 19 appreciation certificates to complainants during the year, recognising their contribution to the enhancement of public administration. For the first time, the Office hosted seminars for universities and tertiary institutes, with a total of 13 seminars held at tertiary and secondary institutes throughout the year to promote a positive complaint culture. The Office is in active preparation for establishing the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy to provide appropriate training for government departments and public organisations, enhance the professional capabilities of staff of the Office, and promote exchanges and co-operation between the Office and overseas ombudsman institutions.

  The Office completed eight direct investigation operations and 40 full investigations during the year, delivering a total of 254 recommendations, 37 per cent more compared to that of the previous year, for improvement of public administration. All the recommendations were accepted by the government departments or organisations concerned, including some having been pursued and implemented. From November 2024 onwards, the Office started making observations in cases concluded after inquiries to highlight the improvements that had been or could be put in place more speedily. As at March 31, 2025, 106 observations had been made and were well received by the government departments or public organisations concerned.

  In the reporting year, the Office received 4 402 complaints on various topics and completed 4 664 cases (including some carried over from the preceding year), of which 3 009 were assessed and closed and 1 655 pursued and concluded.

尊敬的梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、各位議員、各位秘書處和政府的同事：

大家好。今天我很高興能參與立法會圖書館優化設施及服務的啟用儀式。

與我們平時熟悉的圖書館有些不同，立法會圖書館作為憲制圖書館，超過一半的館藏都與憲制及議會有關。自二○一二年立法會綜合大樓啟用以來，立法會圖書館一直為使用者提供不同資源，幫助他們了解立法會的職能、工作和歷史，以至內地和其他地方的憲制制度發展。

立法會一直精益求精，去年底通過一系列圖書館設施及服務的優化建議，打造一個現代化的圖書館。經優化的圖書館除了有舒適的閱讀區及很多政策藏書外，剛才主席亦有提到，亦增設了科技創意空間，配備3D打印機、航拍無人機及虛擬實境裝置，為訪客帶來嶄新的體驗，令圖書館也可以很有活力，經驗可以很不一樣。這些創新設施不但提升了圖書館的功能與吸引力，亦有助公眾更深入了解立法會的工作。

優化後的圖書館亦設有一個全新的專題展覽空間。剛才主席亦有提到，打響頭炮的展覽以「行政立法關係」為主題，回顧香港百多年來行政與立法關係的演變，我覺得非常有意義。

我們在國家的大力支持下，成功落實「愛國者治港」。無論是審議法案和撥款建議、或是為政策措施出謀獻策，現在的立法會議員都以理性、務實的方式議政，實事求是、分秒必爭。在香港邁向「由治及興」的新征程上，政府會繼續和立法會攜手合作，堅持互相尊重，持續良性互動，為市民謀幸福，為香港謀發展，這是我們最重要的目標。

最後，我要再次恭賀立法會順利完成優化圖書館的工程，期待我們更多的年輕人、一般市民，甚至是來自世界各個地方的遊客，都能親身來體驗香港特區立法會的好故事。謝謝大家。"

駐滬辦主任蔡亮致辭時表示，特區政府全力發展經濟，取得亮麗的成績。她鼓勵上海和華東地區的民眾和企業未來繼續用好香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，在香港探索不同的商機、開展投資、就業創業。她亦期望滬港兩地未來在經貿、創科、文化、青年發展等多個方面繼續鼎力合作，共赴雙贏。

SHETO celebrates 28th anniversary of establishment of HKSAR in Shanghai (with photos),2025-07-01 22:00,2025-07-01 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/01/P2025070100318.htm,"To celebrate the 28th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai (SHETO) hosted a dinner reception in Shanghai today (July 1), attended by approximately 180 representatives from Shanghai's government departments, institutions, chambers of commerce, enterprises, and Hong Kong community groups.

Delivering a speech at the dinner reception, the Director of the SHETO, Mrs Laura Aron, highlighted that the HKSAR Government has focused on economic development, achieving remarkable results. She encouraged citizens and enterprises in Shanghai and the East China region to continue leveraging Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore business opportunities, invest, and pursue employment or entrepreneurship in Hong Kong. She also expressed hope for continued robust co-operation between Shanghai and Hong Kong in areas such as trade, innovation, culture, and youth development, fostering mutual benefits.

Mrs Aron mentioned that next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the SHETO. She expressed gratitude to the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their support for the work of the HKSAR Government and the SHETO. The SHETO will continue to facilitate Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation and support mutual success to make greater contributions to the country's high-quality development.

The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Management), Mr Chan Joon-sun, who is visiting Shanghai, attended the dinner. Speaking at the dinner reception, he shared that each anniversary occasion is an opportunity to review the development and achievements of ""one country, two systems"". With the introduction of the dual legislation on national security, Hong Kong has embarked on a new journey, advancing from chaos to order, and from stability to prosperity. It demonstrates the institutional advantages and strong vitality of ""one Country, two systems"". The country has been providing Hong Kong with opportunities to leverage its unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, promoting two-way exchanges between the mainland and the international community.

Hong Kong member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai and Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of New Frontier Group, Mr Carl Wu, also shared remarks at the dinner on Shanghai's support for Hong Kong-invested enterprises and the exchanges between Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The SHETO also invited emerging Hong Kong young artists to perform at the dinner reception, showcasing Hong Kong's diverse cultural charm through a suona performance blending Chinese and Western elements. Several Hong Kong students in Shanghai were also invited to showcase their talents.

The theme of the dinner reception was ""Multifaceted Hong Kong, Infinite Possibilities"", featuring interactive exhibition areas and photo check-in points themed around nine tourism development projects recently announced by the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, alongside the giant pandas gifted by the Central Government as design ideas, offering guests an immersive, multifaceted, and engaging experience of Hong Kong.

The SHETO, in collaboration with Invest Hong Kong, also organised a seminar entitled ""Hong Kong: Enabler of Mainland Catering and Food Enterprises to Go Global"" today. Insights on the competitive advantages and development opportunities of Hong Kong as a preferred place for business were shared with over 100 representatives from catering, food and other industrial sectors in the East China region. They were encouraged to set up business in and develop overseas markets through Hong Kong."
