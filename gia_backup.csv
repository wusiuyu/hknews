AFCD appeals to public to avoid visiting country parks during typhoon,2025-09-07 20:27,2025-09-07 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700838.htm,"TV/radio announcers, please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

As a typhoon is approaching Hong Kong, for safety reasons, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department urges members of the public to avoid visiting country parks. Those who are currently in country parks should, depending on the actual circumstances, immediately leave or take shelter at a safe place."
CHP urges students to receive seasonal influenza vaccination early in new school year as one case of severe paediatric influenza A infection reported,2025-09-07 20:14,2025-09-07 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700810.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 7) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection. The CHP urged the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Schools and parents should arrange their students and children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) programme and receive free SIV to prevent contracting respiratory illnesses.

""Vaccination is the first line of defence against seasonal influenza, reducing the chance of serious complications or death after infection. Including the abovementioned case, there had been four severe paediatric influenza cases since the school resumed. Since January this year, the CHP has recorded 15 cases of severe influenza virus infection in children, 10 of them were unvaccinated in the 2024/25 season. Therefore, we hope that schools and parents could make concerted efforts with us and participate in the SIV outreach activities at school, or arrange for their children to visit their family doctor for the SIV at the start of the new school year to enhance their protection,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The case involved a 11-year-old boy with good past health. He developed a fever, a cough and running nose on September 5. He sought medical attention from a private doctor on September 6. He was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of Ruttonjee Hospital and subsequently transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital the same day. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A complicated with encephalopathy. He is still hospitalised and is in stable condition.
  
The boy’s household contacts, so far, are asymptomatic. He received the SIV last October. There has been no recent influenza outbreak at the school he studied.

Besides, since the start of the new school year, there has been a significant increase in the number of outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI). The CHP recorded four ILI outbreaks in schools in the last week of August (August 24 to August 30), increased to 15 outbreaks this week (August 31 to September 6). The 19 outbreaks recorded in the two weeks include kindergartens/child care centres (five cases), primary schools (nine cases) and secondary schools (five cases).

Although Hong Kong has not entered the summer influenza season so far this year, the CHP's latest surveillance data showed that local influenza activity recently indicated an upward fluctuation and slightly exceeded the baseline threshold. The CHP will cautiously monitor the trend of influenza activity in the next few weeks.

To protect their health and that of their family members, the public should continue to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene and take the following measures to prevent contracting seasonal influenza and other respiratory illnesses:


Persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) should wear surgical masks to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses; high-risk persons (e.g. persons with underlying medical conditions or persons who are immunocompromised) should also wear surgical masks when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Practise hand hygiene frequently, wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Avoid sharing personal items;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, consider refraining from going to work or school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, perform physical activity regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

再錄得一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童新學年盡快接種流感疫苗,2025-09-07 19:38,2025-09-07 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700760.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月七日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案。中心呼籲市民時刻保持良好個人和環境衞生。學校和家長亦應盡快安排學童和子女在新學年參與季節性流感疫苗接種計劃，免費接種流感疫苗，以預防感染呼吸道疾病。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「接種流感疫苗是預防流感的第一道防線，可降低感染後出現嚴重併發症和死亡的機會。計及上述一宗個案，開學後已錄得四宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案。自今年一月起，中心累計已接獲15宗兒童感染流感病毒的嚴重個案，當中10宗未有接種二○二四／二五季度的疫苗。因此，我們希望學校和家長和我們通力合作，在新學年參與季節性流感疫苗學校外展活動或自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種流感疫苗，加強保障學童健康。」

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的十一歲男童，他自九月五日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和流鼻水，九月六日向私家醫生求醫。同日被送往律敦治醫院急症室，再被轉送到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院兒童深切治療部留醫。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發腦病變。他目前仍然留醫，情況穩定。

男童的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。他曾於去年十月接種流感疫苗。他就讀的學校近日沒有出現流感爆發的情況。

另外，新學期開始後，學校出現的流感樣疾病爆發個案顯著增加。中心錄得在學校發生的流感樣疾病爆發個案由八月最後一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的四宗爆發個案，上升至本周（八月三十一日至九月六日）的15宗爆發個案，兩周錄得的共19宗爆發個案涉及幼稚園／幼兒中心（五宗）、小學（九宗）及中學（五宗）。

雖然本港今年暫未出現夏季流感季節，但中心最新監測數據顯示，本地流感活躍程度近期呈現上升波幅，並輕微超越基線水平。中心需要留意未來數周的流感趨勢。

為保障自己和家人健康，市民應繼續保持良好個人和環境衞生，並應採取以下措施，以預防感染季節性流感或其他呼吸道疾病：


出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士應佩戴外科口罩，以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，而高危人士（如本身有健康問題或免疫力低的人士）在乘搭公共交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時亦應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
常保持雙手清潔，雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
避免與他人共用個人物品；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，考慮避免上班或上學，避免前往人多擠迫的地方，並盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常做體能活動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。

勞工處提醒僱主僱員應訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-09-07 19:20,2025-09-07 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700742.htm,"由於八號熱帶氣旋警告信號即將生效，勞工處今日（九月七日）提醒僱主應與員工訂好在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。

勞工處發言人表示：「在擬訂及執行有關安排時，除考慮機構運作需要等因素，僱主應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法，例如容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應就他們的交通、安全、膳食、休息地點等作好安排。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主應遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
LD urges employers and employees to make work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-09-07 19:20,2025-09-07 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700743.htm,"  As Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) will soon be in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (September 7) reminded employers to make work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable).
  
  An LD spokesman said, ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, apart from factors such as operational needs of establishments, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs. For example, employers may permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work.""
  
  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner, or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.
  
  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should work out arrangements for their transportation, safety, meals, rest places and more. If public transport services are suspended or limited when there is a T8 signal or higher, or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

梁卓文在致辭時說，今天這項活動對他個人來說有特別意義，因為他四十多年前是民安隊少年團的一份子，那時的制服、徽章、步操的方式和現在的有所不同，但背後的信念和目標都沒有改變，就是透過訓練和活動，培養青年人的紀律、責任感、正向思維、領導才能，堅毅不屈、團隊協作和服務社會的精神。他在民安隊少年團學到的這些能力，對他有很深刻的正面影響，終身受用。

梁卓文表示，青年是香港的未來，是推動社會進步的最重要力量。香港特別行政區政府一直十分重視青年發展，並推出一系列青年發展計劃，協助青年發揮潛能，實現夢想。當中，民安隊的民盡其才計劃為青少年提供的訓練和體驗，培養他們成為自信、自律及善於溝通的公民。

本年度的民安隊少年團步操比賽以中式步操形式作賽，旨在強化青少年的國家觀念及國民身分認同。是次比賽由逾300名少年團員組成，共16支隊伍參與。另外，今年正值中國人民抗日戰爭勝利80周年，民安隊亦於今日舉辦紀念抗日戰爭勝利80周年口號設計比賽，讓參與者發揮創意、展現愛國情懷。

除今天的兩項比賽，民安隊少年團亦於暑假舉辦了不同的愛國主義交流活動，包括「山東中華文化及體育產業交流2025」、「四川古今科技之旅2025」、「馬來西亞經濟文化及探訪交流之旅」、「同心同根萬里行2025」和「思源之旅」等，讓少年團員了解中國歷史和中華文化，加強共同維護國家安全的意識。

民安隊少年團全年接受申請，有關招募詳情及申請表格，請參閱民安隊網站（www.cas.gov.hk/chi/org/cadet_corps.html）。"

The competitions and award presentation ceremony were officiated by the Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Clement Leung.

  Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Leung said today's event holds special significance for him personally, as over 40 years ago, he was a member of the CAS Cadet Corps. The uniform, insignia, and foot drill back then were different from those of today, but the underlying spirit and goals remain unchanged, that is, to cultivate young people's discipline, sense of responsibility, positive thinking, leadership skills, perseverance and teamwork, as well as to enhance their commitment to serve the community through training and activities. The abilities he acquired while he was in the CAS Cadet Corps had a profound and positive impact on him, and have served him well throughout his life.

  Mr Leung said that young people are the future of Hong Kong and the most important driver of social progress. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has always put great emphasis on youth development and has launched a series of youth development programmes to help young people unleash their potential and realise their dreams. Among them, the CAS's Youth Potential Development Scheme provides young people with training and personal growth, nurturing them to become confident, self-disciplined, and effective communicators in society.

  This year's Cadet Corps Foot Drill Competition was conducted in the form of Chinese-style foot drills, aiming to strengthen their sense of belonging to the country and national identity. About 300 cadets formed into 16 teams participated in the competition. In addition, this year marks the 80th Anniversary of Victory in the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. The CAS also held a slogan design competition today to commemorate this anniversary, encouraging participants to showcase their creativity and express their patriotism.

  In addition to the competitions, the Cadet Corps also organised various patriotic exchange activities during the summer, including the Shandong Chinese Culture and Sports Industry Exchange 2025, the Sichuan Ancient and Modern Technology Tour 2025, the Economic and Cultural Visit to Malaysia, the 10 000 Miles Friendship Trek 2025 and the Si Yuan Exchange Programme, allowing cadets to understand Chinese history and culture better and strengthen their awareness of safeguarding national security.

  The CAS Cadet Corps accepts applications throughout the year. For details on recruitment and application forms, please visit the CAS website (www.cas.gov.hk/eng/org/cadet_corps.html)."

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal. High temperatures and rainfall levels in summer continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world, and members of the public must remain vigilant. They must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

香港海關於機場偵破兩宗旅客販毒案件（附圖）,2025-09-07 17:13,2025-09-07 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700617.htm,"​香港海關於九月五日及昨日（九月六日）在香港國際機場偵破兩宗旅客販運毒品的案件，共檢獲約一點三公斤懷疑可卡因及十二公斤懷疑大麻花，估計市值超過三百七十萬元，並拘捕兩名男子及一名女子。

在首宗案件中，一名四十七歲男旅客於九月五日從尼日利亞拉各斯經埃塞俄比亞阿迪斯阿貝巴飛抵本港。海關人員替他清關期間發現有可疑，懷疑他體內藏有毒品，遂把他帶到醫院檢查。

經檢查後，醫生確認該名人士體內藏有異物，海關人員隨即把他拘捕。截至今日（九月七日）下午三時，被捕人士已從體內排出六十粒共重約一點三公斤的懷疑可卡因。

在第二宗案件中，兩名分別為四十一歲的女旅客及四十歲的男旅客昨日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在二人的手提行李內發現批懷疑大麻花收藏於零食包裝袋內，共重約十二公斤，兩人隨即被捕。

首宗案件仍在調查中。經調查後，第二宗案件兩名被捕人士已共同被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，案件將於明日（九月八日）在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑販毒活動。"

Voters urged to vote in Election Committee Subsector By-elections today (with photos),2025-09-07 13:50,2025-09-07 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700417.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Electoral Affairs Commission:

The Chairman of the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC), Mr Justice David Lok, called on voters to cast their votes in the 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections today (September 7) after visiting the Central Command Centre and the Statistical Information Centre located at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) this morning.

 Mr Justice Lok said, ""In view of the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 issued by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) in the early hours today, the EAC and the Registration and Electoral Office will maintain close communication with the HKO and closely monitor the weather developments. Based on the HKO's latest weather forecast, the Election Committee Subsector By-elections has proceeded today as scheduled. Further notification will be made if there is any other arrangement. As at 11am, 2 369 voters across all polling stations have voted, bringing the accumulative turnout rate to 65.24 per cent.

""Voters and authorised representatives (ARs) are required to vote at their designated polling station as specified on their poll card. The Electronic Poll Register (EPR) system is used to issue ballot papers at the ordinary polling stations in the By-elections. A voter or an AR must produce the original of his/her valid Hong Kong identity (HKID) card at the ballot paper issuing desk in the polling station. The polling staff will scan the HKID card of the voter or AR using a tablet of the EPR system to verify the identity by his/her particulars and mark a record on the system before issuing the ballot paper(s).

""When marking the ballot paper, voters/ARs must fill in the ovals opposite the name(s) of the candidate(s) of their choice with the black pen provided at the polling station, and vote for no more than the prescribed number of seats in the relevant subsector, otherwise the ballot paper will be regarded as invalid. The maximum number of candidates that can be voted for in the subsector concerned will be indicated clearly on the ballot paper. Introduction to Candidates leaflet/booklet on candidates printed by the Registration and Electoral Office are also available at all polling stations for reference by voters/ARs.

""After marking the ballot paper, a voter or an AR may use the ballot paper checking machine provided at the polling station voluntarily to scan the marked ballot paper(s) in order to check whether the ballot paper(s) has/have been marked according to the electoral law, or directly put the ballot paper(s), unfolded, into the ballot box with the marked side facing down.""

Voters/ARs can check the approximate waiting time of each polling station on the election website (www.elections.gov.hk). Relevant signage will also be placed outside the polling stations for reference. Depending on the waiting situation and their schedule, voters/ARs can make their own arrangements on when to vote.

Once the poll is closed, all ballot boxes will be delivered to the Central Counting Station (CCS) at the HKCEC for counting. Candidates, election agents and counting agents may enter the CCS and observe the count at designated areas of the counting zone. Members of the public and media may also enter the public area of the CCS to observe the count. Once the counting of votes is completed, the election results will be declared by the Returning Officers to the candidates and their agents at the counting zone. The election results of each subsector will be announced again by the Returning Officers on the stage of the Media Centre later. A public gallery will be set up at the Media Centre for members of the public to watch the announcement. The election results will be displayed outside the CCS (including the Media Centre) and published via press releases and the election website.

 Five ordinary polling stations (located in the Exhibition Gallery at Hong Kong Central Library, Kowloon Park Sports Centre, Wai Tsuen Sports Centre, Tiu Keng Leng Sports Centre and Che Kung Temple Sports Centre) and one dedicated polling station at Happy Valley Police Station are open from 9am to 6pm today for about 3 600 voters/ARs to cast their votes. In the By-elections, there are 28 candidates contesting a total of 21 seats in six subsectors. The six contested subsectors are commercial (third); architectural, surveying, planning and landscape; technology and innovation; labour; representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of Hong Kong and Kowloon; and representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of the New Territories.

 Mr Justice Lok and EAC Members Professor Daniel Shek and Mr Bernard Man, SC, will respectively inspect different polling stations this afternoon to see for themselves how electoral activities are conducted.

 The election hotline at 2891 1001 will be in service until 6.30pm today to answer enquiries relating to the By-elections. Two complaints hotlines at 2827 7251/3707 0188 will also operate until 6.30pm to handle complaints about breaches of electoral rules and guidelines.

 Hourly voter turnouts and election results will be available on the election website."

​律政司副司長在青Teen友法師友計劃2025啟動禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-07 10:52,2025-09-07 11:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090700301.htm,"以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（九月七日）在青Teen友法師友計劃2025啟動禮致辭：

尊敬的Roden會長（香港律師會會長湯文龍）、Sharon（香港律師會「青Teen講場」籌委會主席譚雪欣）、周一鳴處長（警務處處長）、各位立法會議員、各位律師朋友、各位同學：

大家好。很高興今日能夠和大家一起參加香港律師會2025青Teen友法師友計劃的啟動。首先，我要肯定和感謝香港律師會多年來對青年法治教育的貢獻，以薪火相傳的精神，將法治的精神傳承下去。

律師其實是一個「賣時間」的服務性行業，一般來說，香港的律師可以說都是以時間計算收費，我記得當年實習的時候第一件事是要學懂「每六分鐘一個單位」，每做一件工作都要紀錄時間，因為我們「賣」的是時間，所以律師日常的工作一定是非常忙碌。而今日一班非常有心的律師卻願意在忙碌的日程中抽出寶貴，而且很昂貴的時間參與為期兩年的師友計劃，在這個以年計的計劃中，律師導師與同學們建立亦師亦友的關係，不只是傳授法律知識，更是陪伴各位同學們探索自我、規劃未來，並在成長路上希望能夠讓大家自覺地融入對法治的尊重與遵守。我非常欣賞和感謝各位律師朋友身體力行，無私的付出和持續的參與，為社會作出非常重大的貢獻。

而我們作為律師，經常都會遇到朋友會問的一個問題，就是：「究竟讀法律難不難？」我可以告訴大家，如果你將法律抽離現實，每天只在法律條文的文字中琢磨鑽研，你是無法掌握法律的靈魂，也會覺得法律是枯燥無味。但是如果你懂得方法，把法律和我們身邊所發生的事和人物結合起來，你就會了解各種人和事之間的關係，更會明白法律的真締。

為甚麼？試想想，如果世界上只得你一個人，當然這個世界就不必有法律，因為你可以支配世界，為所欲為。但是世界不只得你一個人，而是由很多人組成的社會。社會當中每個人的想法不一樣，價值觀不一樣，甚至做事手法也不一樣。所以，我們就要有一個公平、公開的法律制度去清楚訂明大家的權利和責任，為社會制定一套必須遵守的最低社會標準和底線。有了這個法律制度，大家才能安穩地生活，社會才能穩定地發展。因此，法律是和我們的生活息息相關，緊密相連。透過認識法律，你就會更加能夠認識你身邊的人、身邊的事，甚至更加認識自己。

因此，我衷心感謝各位導師、香港律師會和各個合作單位的付出與支持，為青年朋友提供一個有深度和有溫度的法治教育環境。我更希望各位青年朋友以後都能夠在這個複雜的世界中保持獨立思考，在誘惑面前選擇正直，在困難中堅持信念。

祝2025青Teen友法師友計劃取得圓滿成功。多謝大家。"

Employers and employees should make prior work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-09-07 02:41,2025-09-07 05:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090601000.htm,"  As the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 (T3) is now in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (Date) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of establishments, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements and contingency measures for periods during and after tropical cyclone warnings and rainstorm warnings, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees, as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or when the extreme conditions come to an end, and when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when a tropical cyclone warning, rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.
 
  When a Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement is issued during working hours, within two hours before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is expected to take effect, employers should release employees from workplaces or from work in stages or arrange for them to work remotely according to the agreed work arrangements. To ensure the safety of employees and to enable them to arrive home before suspension of public transport services, employees who have mobility problems (for example, pregnant employees or those with a disability), employees who rely on transport services which are prone to being affected by adverse weather conditions (for example, ferry services) to get home, and those who work in or are living in remote areas (for example, outlying islands) should be given priority to leave. Other employees should be released from workplaces or from work in stages according to their travelling distance or the time required for returning home.
  
  If an Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.
   
  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance on the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) or higher, Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.
  
  The spokesman also reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.

  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when there is a T8 signal or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
僱主僱員應預先訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-09-07 02:40,2025-09-07 05:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/07/P2025090600997.htm,"由於三號熱帶氣旋警告信號現已生效，勞工處今日（九月七日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主在擬訂及執行在熱帶氣旋及暴雨警告下及其後的工作安排和應變措施時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。

當天文台在工作時間內、預計八號熱帶氣旋警告信號生效前的兩小時內發出預警，僱主應按協定的工作安排讓僱員分批離開工作地點、下班或遙距工作。為確保僱員安全和趕及在公共交通服務停止前回家，一些行動不便的僱員（例如懷孕或殘疾僱員）、須依靠容易受惡劣天氣影響的交通服務（例如渡輪服務）返回居所的僱員，以及於偏遠地點工作或居住的僱員（例如離島），應獲准優先離開。僱主亦應安排其他僱員按返家路程的距離或所需時間分批離開工作地點或下班。

如果黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外及空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣或極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號、黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。

另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
