DH's Medical Device Administrative Control System receives ISO 9001:2015 certification (with photos),2026-01-05 14:38,2026-01-05 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500427.htm,"  ​The Medical Device Administrative Control System (MDACS) of the Department of Health (DH) has been awarded the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems (QMS) Certificate, developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The award ceremony was held today (January 5). The achievement of the MDACS in obtaining this international standard marks an important milestone in laying the foundation for the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) by the DH at the end of this year. This accomplishment will facilitate international recognition and foster an innovation-friendly environment.

The ceremony took place at the DH's headquarters. The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, said, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is committed to raising regulatory standards for medical products in Hong Kong. With the establishment of the CMPR, we will consolidate regulatory functions for Western and Chinese medicines, as well as medical devices, thereby enhancing the existing regulatory regime in a holistic manner. The DH is proceeding at full speed with preparatory work, guided by three key strategies: promoting regulatory excellence, fostering innovation in pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and deepening co-operation with the Chinese Mainland and overseas countries. The ISO accreditation, which covers all aspects of the MDACS (including pre- and post-market control), will strengthen confidence among industry professionals both in Hong Kong and internationally, as well as among the general public. It will encourage more medical device manufacturers and importers to voluntarily list their medical devices with the MDACS. In the long run, it will also help facilitate a smooth transition for listed products to the statutory regulatory framework.""

  To safeguard public health, the DH has drawn on recommendations from the Global Harmonization Task Force (now known as the International Medical Device Regulators Forum) and introduced the voluntary MDACS in 2004. The system involves approving the list of medical devices to ensure their safety, quality, and performance, establishing a trader listing system, and implementing a post-market monitoring system for products.

""Currently, over 8 900 medical devices are listed under the MDACS. In response to the latest international trends in medical device regulation and to align with the establishment timeline of the CMPR, the Government is pressing ahead with legislative preparations and comprehensively reviewing the proposed regulatory framework. Legislative proposals are expected to be submitted to the Legislative Council this year. Under the new framework, all medical devices supplied in Hong Kong will require registration unless exempted, ensuring compliance with relevant safety, quality, and performance standards,"" Dr Lam said.

ISO 9001 is an internationally recognised QMS standard developed by the ISO. It assists organisations in establishing consistent procedures to ensure their products and services consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and promoting sustainable business development. This standard is one of the most widely adopted quality improvement frameworks worldwide, improving operational efficiency and quality through risk-based thinking and continuous improvement.

The Medical Device Division of the DH initiated the establishment of its QMS in 2025 and obtained ISO 9001:2015 QMS certification in December of the same year. Additionally, the DH's Drug Office obtained ISO 9001 QMS certifications in 2005 for drug traders licensing procedures and inspection of undesirable medical advertisements, and in 2009 for its manufacturer licensing and quality management standard inspections. The relevant QMS will continue to be implemented after the establishment of the CMPR."

頒授儀式在衞生署總部舉行，衞生署署長林文健醫生說：「香港特別行政區政府致力提升香港藥械的監管水平。『香港藥械監管中心』成立後，將整合西藥、中藥及醫療器械的監管職能，全面提升現行制度。衞生署正全速進行籌建工作，以三大策略為導向，包括推動優質監管、促進藥械創新，以及深化與中國內地和國際合作。今次榮獲ISO（國際標準化組織）認證，涵蓋管理制度的全部工作，包括醫療器械上市前和上市後監管，有助增強海內外業界和廣大市民的信心，鼓勵更多醫療器械製造商和進口商根據這個制度自願向衞生署表列其醫療器械，亦有助相關各方日後順利過渡至長遠的法定規管模式。」

為保障公眾健康，衞生署自二○○四年起參考全球協調醫療器械規管專責小組（現為國際醫療器械監管機構論壇）的建議，設立自願性的管理制度，透過審批表列醫療器械，確保其安全、品質和性能，並推行貿易商的制度和產品推出市場後的監察系統。

林文健醫生說：「目前已有超過8 900項醫療器械在表列制度下表列。因應近年國際間規管醫療器械的最新趨勢，同時為配合『香港藥械監管中心』的成立時間表，政府現正全力推進相關立法準備工作，全面檢討擬議規管架構，預計今年向立法會提交立法建議。在新的立法框架下，日後所有在港供應的醫療器械，如非獲豁免均須註冊，以確保符合安全、品質和性能的相關標準。」

ISO 9001是一套國際認可的品質管理系統標準，由國際標準化組織制定，旨在幫助組織建立一套一致的流程，以確保組織的產品和服務能持續滿足客戶及法規要求，最終提升客戶滿意度並促進企業永續發展。此標準是全球最具認受性的品質改善框架之一，透過風險導向思維和持續改善，提高營運效率和品質。

衞生署醫療器械科二○二五年啓動建立質量管理體系程序，同年十二月獲ISO 9001：2015質量管理體系認證。此外，衞生署藥物辦公室亦分別已於二○○五年就藥商的發牌程序及不良廣告（醫藥）的查閱，以及於二○○九年就生產商發牌及質量管理規範巡查獲ISO 9001質量管理體系認證。相關品質管理系統在「香港藥械監管中心」成立後繼續推行。"

波蘭羊之歌劇團二月首度來港演出愛丁堡藝穗節首奬劇作《李爾王之歌》（附圖）,2026-01-05 11:17,2026-01-05 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010200481.htm,"波蘭羊之歌劇團將於二月上旬首度來港，為康樂及文化事務署的「歐洲劇團雙聲迴響」帶來愛丁堡藝穗節首奬作品《李爾王之歌》。此劇將莎士比亞的經典悲劇重新演繹成一部震撼心靈的戲劇式清唱劇，將莎士比亞的文本片段與原創音樂、多聲部合唱、演員的肢體動作和簡約的舞台交織在一起，構成一種詩意盎然的敘事方式，以當代視角凝煉出《李爾王》的情感與精神本質，打造出一場與觀眾同頻共振的沉浸式體驗。

《李爾王》是莎士比亞四大悲劇之一，講述年老的李爾王把國土分給阿諛奉承的大女兒和二女兒，遜位後反遭二人虐待，流落荒野而發瘋；真誠的小女兒率軍欲救他但戰敗而亡，李爾悲傷至死。此劇深刻揭示人性的複雜與脆弱，以及在命運面前的無助與悲涼。《李爾王之歌》的靈感源自藝術家康丁斯基的「即興」和「結構」主題，同時探索「聲音的色彩」，創作出連串「歌曲畫作」以捕捉《李爾王》不同場景的情感。

此劇由劇團共同創辦人格熱戈日‧布拉爾執導，11位演員兼歌唱家演出，以12首原創歌曲帶出莎士比亞悲劇中的關鍵場口。整場演出透過格熱戈日‧布拉爾於歌曲（劇中稱為「畫作」）之間的敘述串聯，引領觀眾穿梭於故事脈絡之中。該12首歌曲由波蘭多樂器演奏家馬切伊‧里赫維和科西嘉著名作曲家尚—克洛德‧阿克瓦維瓦共同創作，當中糅合科西嘉民間音樂和格利果聖咏，創造出豐富多彩的跨文化音樂。伴奏則極為簡約，只包含一組鼓面、印度風琴、科拉琴（西非豎琴）和瑞典鍵盤提琴，而精心構思的合唱編排穿插着激昂的敲擊樂，配合表演者細膩的和聲和無伴奏合唱，交織出具層次和感染力的聲景，喚起觀眾對《李爾王》中情感的共鳴。舞台布置及服裝亦以極簡方式呈現，令台上演員的肢體律動以至每個細微動作和表情均能帶出莎劇中令人驚嘆的音樂性和張力。

《李爾王之歌》於二○一二年愛丁堡藝穗節作世界首演，並橫掃三項大獎，包括《蘇格蘭人報》藝穗節首獎、先驅天使獎及音樂戲劇特別獎，隨後於歐亞和美洲多個城市巡演，廣獲好評。

羊之歌劇團於一九九六年創立，被譽為波蘭前衛劇場界最具創新精神的流派。劇團承襲波蘭協同劇場的悠久傳統，並發展出獨特的表演風格，每部作品各具特色，但仍貫徹類同的創作手法：以肢體動作、聲音、歌唱與文本作為可相互轉化的創作元素，形成其獨有的表演協調技法。格熱戈日‧布拉爾為劇團的共同創辦人及藝術總監，亦是「布拉爾表演方法」的創立者。他積極投身教育工作，其表演方法對世界各地的藝術家和機構皆有深遠的影響，並獲波蘭文化和民族遺產部頒發榮譽勳章以表揚其對藝術與教育的貢獻。

羊之歌劇團《李爾王之歌》（波蘭）於二月六日及七日（星期五及六）晚上八時，以及二月八日（星期日）下午三時在香港大會堂劇院舉行，英語旁白附中英文字幕，歌曲則以不同語言（拉丁語、科普特語和英語）演繹。票價分380元及480元，現於城市售票網（www.urbtix.hk）發售。電話購票可致電3166 1288。查詢節目詳情及相關購票優惠，請致電2268 7325，或瀏覽www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/tc/theatre/programs_1927.html。二月六及七日場次演出後設有演後藝人談（英語主講），歡迎觀眾留步參與。

本節目另設兩場劇場工作坊（英語主講），於二月四日及八日（星期三及日）晚上七時三十分在上環文娛中心七樓排練廳舉行，由導演格熱戈日．布拉爾和表演者阿利西婭．布拉爾作指導，探討格熱戈日．布拉爾所創立的表演方法，並分享戲劇創作過程的獨特見解。票價為200元，現於城市售票網發售，詳情請參閱上述網頁。"
"Song of the Goat Theatre from Poland to make Hong Kong debut with Edinburgh Fringe First award-winning play ""Songs of Lear"" in February (with photos)",2026-01-05 11:17,2026-01-05 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010200484.htm,"  Song of the Goat Theatre from Poland will perform in Hong Kong for the first time with its Edinburgh Fringe First award-winning play ""Songs of Lear"" at the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's ""European Theatres in Resonance"" in early February. The work reimagines Shakespeare's classic tragedy as a soul-stirring dramatic oratorio, interweaving fragments of Shakespeare's text with original music, polyphonic singing, performers' movements and minimal staging into a poetic narrative. It distills the emotional and spiritual essence of ""King Lear"" in a bold contemporary light to create an immersive experience that resonates with the audience.

  ""King Lear"" stands as one of Shakespeare's four great tragedies, recounting the tale of an ageing King Lear who divides his kingdom among his two flattering elder daughters. After abdication, he is cruelly mistreated by them, resulting in his exile to the wilderness, where he descends into madness. His sincere youngest daughter, who seeks to rescue him with her army, is defeated and perishes, leading Lear to succumb to grief and die. The play profoundly explores the intricate and fragile nature of human existence, revealing the poignant sense of helplessness and sorrow in the face of fate. ""Songs of Lear"" was inspired by artist Kandinsky's principles of ""improvisation"" and ""structure"" while pursuing an investigation of the ""colour of sound"", creating a series of ""song-paintings"" to capture the emotional landscapes of scenes from ""King Lear"".

  Directed by the company's co-founder Grzegorz Bral, the production features 11 performer-vocalists and includes 12 original compositions expanding upon key moments from Shakespeare's tragedy. The performance is framed by Bral's narrative between songs (called ""paintings"" in the play) serving to orientate audiences within the story. The 12 songs are compositions created by Polish multi-instrumentalist Maciej Rychły and celebrated Corsican composer Jean-Claude Acquaviva, blending Corsican folk music with Gregorian chants to weave rich and cross-cultural music. The accompaniment is remarkably minimalist, featuring only a set of drumheads, an Indian harmonium, a kora (West African harp lute) and a nyckelharpa. In addition, the meticulously crafted choral arrangements are punctuated by blasts of intense percussion, intertwined with exquisite harmonies and a cappella singing. Together, the performance creates a layered and evocative soundscape that resonates with the emotional core of ""King Lear"". With the simplest stage setup and costume, it allows every gesture, subtle movement and expression of the performers to bring out the astonishing musicality and tension inherent in Shakespeare's text.

  ""Songs of Lear"" had its world premiere during the 2012 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where it swept three major awards, namely The Scotsman Fringe First, Herald Archangel, and Musical Theatre Matters awards. It subsequently toured numerous cities across Europe, Asia and the Americas to widespread acclaim.

  Song of the Goat Theatre, founded in 1996, has been hailed as the most innovative of the new Avant-garde theatre movements in Poland. Continuing the long tradition of Polish ensemble theatre work, the company has devised a unique performance style. Each production is different, yet they share a similar approach of combining movements, vocals, song and text, which are interchangeable elements in its acting co-ordination technique. Bral, co-founder and artistic director of the company, is also the creator of the Bral Acting Method. He is active as an educator and his acting method has influenced artists and institutions worldwide. He has received the Honorary Order from the Polish Minister of Culture and National Heritage for his artistic and educational contributions.

  ""Songs of Lear"" by Song of the Goat Theatre (Poland) will be held at 8pm on February 6 and 7 (Friday and Saturday), and at 3pm on February 8 (Sunday) at the Theatre of Hong Kong City Hall. The play has English narration with Chinese and English surtitles, while the songs will be performed in multiple languages (Latin, Coptic and English). Tickets priced at $380 and $480 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288. For programme enquiries and concessionary schemes, please call 2268 7325 or visitwww.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/en/theatre/programs_1927.html. Both performances on February 6 and 7 will be followed by a meet-the-artist session (conducted in English). Audience members are welcome to stay behind to join.

  The programme will also feature two theatre workshops (conducted in English) on February 4 and 8 (Wednesday and Sunday) at 7.30pm at the Rehearsal Hall, 7/F, Sheung Wan Civic Centre. Led by director Bral and performer Alicja Bral, the workshops will explore Bral's renowned acting method and offer unique insights into the theatrical creation process. Tickets priced at $200 are now available at URBTIX. For details, please refer to the above-mentioned website."
漁護署在各漁港展開狂犬病防疫注射,2026-01-05 11:00,2026-01-05 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500203.htm,"漁農自然護理署（漁護署）今日（一月五日）公布將在本地漁港為漁民的狗隻注射狂犬病疫苗、植入晶片及續領牌照。

漁護署流動注射隊將於下列指定日期上午十時至下午三時在下列漁港提供服務：




三門仔
			沙頭角
			青山灣
一月十二日
			一月十四日
			一月十六日


香港仔
			筲箕灣
一月十六日
			一月二十三日


西貢
一月二十六日


長洲
一月三十日




該項服務自一九八○年開始，每半年進行一次，目的是為長期出海作業的漁船上飼養的狗隻，提供續領牌照及狂犬病注射疫苗服務。每隻狗的服務費為八十元。漁護署至今已為漁船上的狗隻注射超過七千四百劑疫苗。

漁護署發言人表示，這是政府積極預防狂犬病而採取的多項措施之一。俗稱「瘋狗症」的狂犬病是可由動物傳染給人類的致命疾病。漁船上的狗隻由於有可能在外地與其他動物接觸，故較容易染上狂犬病。

發言人說：「雖然香港自一九八七年起未有動物狂犬病個案，但我們仍須保持警覺，防止狂犬病再次出現。」

根據《狂犬病條例》（第421章），所有超過五個月大的狗隻都必須接種狂犬病疫苗、領有牌照和植入晶片，狗隻亦須其後每隔不超過三年再接種狂犬病疫苗及續牌，違例者一經定罪最高可被判罰款一萬元。"

屋宇署發言人今日（一月五日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"
"Three co-owners fined over $230,000 for not complying with removal order",2026-01-05 11:00,2026-01-05 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500199.htm,"  ​Three co-owners were convicted and fined $230,820 in total, of which $221,820 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts last Friday (January 2) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).
  
  The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 7 square metres and a metal frame over the yard; as well as a projecting structure with an area of about 3 sq m, three metal frames and two canvas sheets attached to the external walls of a composite building on Fook Tak Street, Yuen Long. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.
  
  A spokesman for the BD said today (January 5), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""
  
  Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."
AFCD to launch dog inoculation campaign against rabies at fishing ports,2026-01-05 11:00,2026-01-05 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500200.htm,"  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) announced today (January 5) that a dog inoculation campaign will be held at various fishing ports in Hong Kong. Fishermen can have their dogs vaccinated against rabies, microchipped, and their dog licences renewed.

  The AFCD mobile vaccination teams will provide the services at the following fishing ports according to the schedule below from 10am to 3pm:




Sam Mun Tsai
January 12


Sha Tau Kok
January 14


Castle Peak
January 16


Aberdeen
January 16


Shau Kei Wan
January 23


Sai Kung
January 26


Cheung Chau
January 30




  The half-yearly dog inoculation campaign has been held since 1980 with the aim of providing licensing renewal and rabies vaccination services for dogs that are kept by fishermen on board fishing vessels and spend long periods of time there. A fee of $80 will be charged for each dog. To date, over 7 400 vaccinations have been given to dogs on fishing vessels by the AFCD.

  An AFCD spokesman said that the services are part of the Government's proactive measures to prevent rabies, a fatal disease that is transmitted to humans from animals. Dogs on board vessels that have visited places outside Hong Kong may have come into contact with other animals, making them more susceptible to rabies infection.

  ""Although Hong Kong has been free from animal rabies since 1987, we must remain vigilant to prevent any possible outbreak,"" the spokesman said.

  Under the Rabies Ordinance (Cap. 421), all dogs aged over 5 months must be vaccinated against rabies, licensed and microchipped. Dogs have to be revaccinated against rabies, and their licences have to be renewed at intervals not exceeding three years. Dog owners who fail to do so are liable to a maximum fine of $10,000 upon conviction."

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-04 17:30,2026-01-04 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/04/P2026010400402.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 4), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
