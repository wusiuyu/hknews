漁護署在各漁港展開狂犬病防疫注射,2026-01-05 11:00,2026-01-05 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500203.htm,"漁農自然護理署（漁護署）今日（一月五日）公布將在本地漁港為漁民的狗隻注射狂犬病疫苗、植入晶片及續領牌照。

漁護署流動注射隊將於下列指定日期上午十時至下午三時在下列漁港提供服務：




三門仔
			沙頭角
			青山灣
一月十二日
			一月十四日
			一月十六日


香港仔
			筲箕灣
一月十六日
			一月二十三日


西貢
一月二十六日


長洲
一月三十日




該項服務自一九八○年開始，每半年進行一次，目的是為長期出海作業的漁船上飼養的狗隻，提供續領牌照及狂犬病注射疫苗服務。每隻狗的服務費為八十元。漁護署至今已為漁船上的狗隻注射超過七千四百劑疫苗。

漁護署發言人表示，這是政府積極預防狂犬病而採取的多項措施之一。俗稱「瘋狗症」的狂犬病是可由動物傳染給人類的致命疾病。漁船上的狗隻由於有可能在外地與其他動物接觸，故較容易染上狂犬病。

發言人說：「雖然香港自一九八七年起未有動物狂犬病個案，但我們仍須保持警覺，防止狂犬病再次出現。」

根據《狂犬病條例》（第421章），所有超過五個月大的狗隻都必須接種狂犬病疫苗、領有牌照和植入晶片，狗隻亦須其後每隔不超過三年再接種狂犬病疫苗及續牌，違例者一經定罪最高可被判罰款一萬元。"

有關個䅁涉及元朗褔德街一幢商住大廈天井的一個面積約七平方米的搭建物及一個金屬架，以及外牆附建的一個面積約三平方米的伸建物、三個金屬架及兩個帆布篷。該等僭建物並無事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，屋宇署根據《建築物條例》第24（1）條向業主發出一張清拆令。他們沒有履行清拆令，故遭屋宇署檢控。

屋宇署發言人今日（一月五日）說：「僭建物可導致嚴重後果。業主必須盡快遵從清拆令。對於未有遵從清拆令的業主，屋宇署會繼續採取執法行動，包括提出檢控，以保障樓宇及公眾安全。」

根據《建築物條例》，任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從清拆令是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可處罰款200,000元及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。"
"Three co-owners fined over $230,000 for not complying with removal order",2026-01-05 11:00,2026-01-05 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500199.htm,"  ​Three co-owners were convicted and fined $230,820 in total, of which $221,820 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts last Friday (January 2) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).
  
  The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 7 square metres and a metal frame over the yard; as well as a projecting structure with an area of about 3 sq m, three metal frames and two canvas sheets attached to the external walls of a composite building on Fook Tak Street, Yuen Long. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.
  
  A spokesman for the BD said today (January 5), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""
  
  Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."
AFCD to launch dog inoculation campaign against rabies at fishing ports,2026-01-05 11:00,2026-01-05 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/05/P2026010500200.htm,"  The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) announced today (January 5) that a dog inoculation campaign will be held at various fishing ports in Hong Kong. Fishermen can have their dogs vaccinated against rabies, microchipped, and their dog licences renewed.

  The AFCD mobile vaccination teams will provide the services at the following fishing ports according to the schedule below from 10am to 3pm:




Sam Mun Tsai
January 12


Sha Tau Kok
January 14


Castle Peak
January 16


Aberdeen
January 16


Shau Kei Wan
January 23


Sai Kung
January 26


Cheung Chau
January 30




  The half-yearly dog inoculation campaign has been held since 1980 with the aim of providing licensing renewal and rabies vaccination services for dogs that are kept by fishermen on board fishing vessels and spend long periods of time there. A fee of $80 will be charged for each dog. To date, over 7 400 vaccinations have been given to dogs on fishing vessels by the AFCD.

  An AFCD spokesman said that the services are part of the Government's proactive measures to prevent rabies, a fatal disease that is transmitted to humans from animals. Dogs on board vessels that have visited places outside Hong Kong may have come into contact with other animals, making them more susceptible to rabies infection.

  ""Although Hong Kong has been free from animal rabies since 1987, we must remain vigilant to prevent any possible outbreak,"" the spokesman said.

  Under the Rabies Ordinance (Cap. 421), all dogs aged over 5 months must be vaccinated against rabies, licensed and microchipped. Dogs have to be revaccinated against rabies, and their licences have to be renewed at intervals not exceeding three years. Dog owners who fail to do so are liable to a maximum fine of $10,000 upon conviction."

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-04 17:30,2026-01-04 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/04/P2026010400402.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 4), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-04 17:30,2026-01-04 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/04/P2026010400403.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月四日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
