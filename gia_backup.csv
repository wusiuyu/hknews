Addressing the dinner, Miss Cheng said that with the staunch support of the motherland and the advantages in connecting the Mainland and the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong has continued to consolidate its status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre. Hong Kong has performed remarkably in international rankings. It was named the world's freest economy in the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report, and ranked third globally in the World CompetitivenessYearbook 2025, the World Investment Report 2025 and the Global Financial Centres Index. Hong Kong's success in attracting top-tier international companies and talent is also widely acknowledged. The number of companies in Hong Kong with overseas or Mainland parent companies has risen to 9 960, while the number of start-ups in the city increased to around 4 700, both reaching record highs.

Miss Cheng added that Hong Kong has a close relationship with the Philippines. Hong Kong is the Philippines' fifth largest trading partner, with bilateral trade in goods amounting to US$13.9 billion last year. In tourism, Hong Kong has continued to attract Filipino visitors, welcoming around 1.2 million arrivals from the Philippines last year, representing a 55 per cent increase compared with 2023. In the first five months of this year alone, more than 550 000 Filipino visitors travelled to Hong Kong, marking a 27 per cent year-on-year increase and reflecting strong people-to-people ties between the two places.

Miss Cheng also shared the latest developments in Hong Kong with the guests, highlighting the emerging opportunities under the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as strategic responses to future challenges. She said that as a global financial and trade centre, Hong Kong is well positioned to serve as a vital bridge connecting MainlandChina and the Philippines. She thanked the chamber for fostering connections, and hoped that more outstanding Philippine enterprises would expand their business networks in Hong Kong to create synergy. On the other hand, Hong Kong has been actively seeking early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, with a view to making greater contributions to regional development.

Around 250 representatives from the local government and business sectors, including the Minister Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines, Ms Wang Yulei, and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's Consultant in Manila, Ms Maribeth Barros, attended the event."

The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, officiated at the event, commending schools, students and families for their outstanding performance in waste reduction and recycling during the 2024/25 school year.

  Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Tse highlighted that the current-term Government has successfully reversed the long-term trend of rising waste disposal quantities over the years through promoting waste reduction at source and expanding the recycling network. The disposal quantity of municipal solid waste decreased by a total of 7.5 per cent from 2021 to 2024, while the waste recovery rate increased from 28 per cent in 2020 to 33 per cent in 2023.

  Mr Tse congratulated all the awarded schools, students and families, expressing gratitude for their support of Hong Kong's waste reduction and recycling efforts. He said, ""To achieve waste reduction at source, it is crucial to educate the next generation. In 2024, the EPD launched the We-recycle@School Activity, providing a variety of teaching materials and promotional support to primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong to assist schools and teachers in integrating waste reduction and recycling knowledge into daily teaching, encourage students to make good use of recycling facilities in schools and the community, and inspire their family members to practise resource separation and recycling together.""

  Since its launch, the We-recycle@School Activity has received an overwhelming response. Currently, around 550 primary and secondary schools have participated in the scheme, encompassing about 350000 students. Through the We-recycle@School Activity, the EPD has collaborated with the Ocean Park Conservation Alliance to jointly host the SGREEN Inter-school Recycling Competition this school year, which successfully encouraged more schools to engage in the activities of both sides. The Competition features seven awards to recognise participating schools, students, and families for their outstanding performances in waste reduction and recycling this school year. The list of award winners can be found in the annex. The awards are:


Supreme Recycling Award - School
Top Recycling Quantity Award - School
Best Participating School Award
Best Participating Family Award
Recycling Guru Award
Best Green and Low Carbon Action Award
Best School Recycling Corner Design Award


  The award ceremony today also featured 21 booths where awarded schools and other participating schools shared their knowledge on waste reduction and recycling, low-carbon living and ecological conservation through interactive exhibitions and booth games, demonstrating how to practise green living in daily life.

  The We-recycle@School Activity was launched on March 1 last year, inviting primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong to participate in the activity which includes various waste reduction and recycling competitions with awards to encourage students and their family members to actively participate in waste reduction and recycling. In the 2024/25 school year, the SGREEN Inter-school Recycling Competition and other We-recycle@School competitions together collected about 132 000 kilograms of recyclables in total."

電影報刊辦表揚中小學生藉創作協助推廣健康使用互聯網信息（附圖）,2025-07-05 16:00,2025-07-05 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500276.htm,"電影、報刊及物品管理辦事處（電影報刊辦）今日（七月五日）就「健康學生短片大賽2025」、「《淫褻及不雅物品管制條例》口號創作及填色比賽 2024-25」及「健康貼圖設計大賽」舉行頒獎典禮，表揚獲獎學生及隊伍透過創作協助推廣遠離網上淫褻及不雅資訊的信息。

三項比賽合共吸引約兩萬名中、小學生參與，設有60個主要獎項。評審委員會由電影報刊辦代表和業界的專業人士組成。得獎者分別來自25間小學及20間中學（名單詳見附件），其作品將上載至電影報刊辦網頁供公眾瀏覽。

電影、報刊及物品管理助理專員馮品聰在頒獎典禮上表示，網絡世界包羅萬有，近年各種影片串流或分享平台及社交媒體盛行，兒童及青少年使用網絡時有可能接觸到淫褻及不雅資訊和歪曲的價值觀，影響身心健康。若在互聯網上分享不良資訊，甚或製作相關內容上載至互聯網，更有可能觸犯《淫褻及不雅物品管制條例》（第390章）（《條例》）。為保護兒童及青少年免受網上淫褻及不雅資訊影響，電影報刊辦一直採取多管齊下的策略，在做好監管的同時亦致力加強宣傳和公眾教育，提高公眾尤其是兒童及青少年對《條例》的認識，鼓勵他們遠離不良資訊，並建立正確使用互聯網的觀念。

電影報刊辦在過去一年繼續加強宣傳教育工作，除了舉辦上述比賽外，亦在本學年安排近百場教育短劇巡迴表演，吸引近15 000名中小學生觀看；並在藍田、樂富、天水圍及將軍澳舉辦巡迴展覽，更廣泛地宣傳健康使用互聯網的信息，吸引逾12 000名市民參觀。

電影報刊辦會持續推展上述工作，並會繼續透過舉辦「健康資訊學生大使計劃」、「健康學生演說大賽」及「健康學生戲劇大賽」等不同形式的活動，進一步提高公眾對《條例》的認識和推廣健康上網的觀念。

此外，電影報刊辦亦加強跨部門、跨組織協作，為兒童及青少年、家長、教職員及公眾等不同持份者舉辦多元和具針對性的活動，當中包括聯同民政及青年事務局，通過不同渠道和平台，如家庭議會、青年手機應用程式「HKYouth+」及政府青少年網站（Youth.gov.hk），向兒童及青少年推廣《條例》相關的活動與資訊，以及與香港警務處合作在多區舉辦「善用互聯網」講座，以趣味互動形式向少年警訊會員及學生分享使用互聯網的常見陷阱，協助他們建立正確價值觀，同時加深他們對《條例》的認識。

電影報刊辦亦舉辦多項活動，協助教職員加強在校內的相關工作，包括在二○二四年舉辦逾250場學校講座和三場網上簡介會，向約100間中小學的校長或其代表作簡介，以及於今年參與教育局舉辦的教師專業發展課程研討會，向逾200名小學教師介紹《條例》及相關活動和資源。電影報刊辦並不時舉辦為家長而設的講座、工作坊、網上座談會等活動，與家長和學校攜手協助兒童及青少年建立正確的價值觀，並加強他們拒絕接收不良資訊的能力。

電影報刊辦會繼續致力推動多元化的宣傳及公眾教育工作，與不同持份者攜手合作，積極提高公眾對《條例》的認識和推廣遠離網上淫褻及不雅內容的信息。"
OFNAA commends primary and secondary students for assisting in promoting healthy Internet use through creative works (with photos),2025-07-05 16:00,2025-07-05 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500273.htm," The Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration (OFNAA) held a prize presentation ceremony today (July 5) for the ""Healthy Student Video Contest 2025"", the ""'Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance' Slogan and Colouring Competition 2024-25"" and the ""Healthy Mobile App Sticker Design Competition"" in commendation of the winning students and teams for assisting in promoting the message of staying away from obscene and indecent articles online through creative works.

 A total of around 20 000 primary and secondary students participated in the three competitions which offered 60 major awards altogether. The adjudication panel comprised OFNAA representatives and industry professionals. Winners from 25 primary schools and 20 secondary schools (the list is set out in Annex) will have their works uploaded to OFNAA's website for public viewing.

 Speaking at the prize presentation ceremony, the Assistant Director of Film, Newspaper and Article Administration, Mr Chris Fung, said that with the prevalence of various video streaming or video sharing platforms and social media in recent years given rise by the fascinating cyber world, children and young people may be exposed to obscene and indecent materials as well as distorted values while using the Internet, affecting their physical and mental wellbeing. Sharing of harmful materials on the Internet, or even producing and uploading such content on the Internet, may be in breach of the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap. 390) (COIAO). To protect children and young people from the influence of obscene and indecent materials online, OFNAA has been adopting a multi-pronged approach by enhancing publicity and public education in tandem with proper regulation, so as to enhance the understanding of the public, especially children and young people, of the COIAO and to encourage them to stay away from harmful materials and to develop the concept of the proper use of the Internet.

 OFNAA has continued to enhance its publicity and education efforts over the past year. In addition to organising the abovementioned competitions, OFNAA arranged nearly 100 roving drama performances for schools in this academic year, attracting nearly 15 000 primary and secondary students. Roving exhibitions were also held in Lam Tin, Lok Fu, Tin Shui Wai and Tseung Kwan O to promote more widely the message of healthy Internet use, attracting over 12 000 visitors. 

 OFNAA will continue to take forward these efforts and organise various activities including the ""Healthy Information Student Ambassadors Scheme"", the ""Healthy Chinese Public Speaking Competition"" and the ""Healthy Student Drama Contest"" to further enhance the public's understanding of the COIAO and promote the concept of healthy Internet use.

 In addition, OFNAA has strengthened inter-departmental and inter-organisational collaboration to organise diverse and targeted activities for different stakeholders, including children and young people, parents, teaching staff members and the public. These included working with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau to promote activities and information concerning the COIAO to children and young people through various channels and platforms including the Family Council, the ""HKYouth+"" youth mobile application, and the Government Youth Portal (Youth.gov.hk), as well as partnering with the Hong Kong Police Force to organise ""Wise Use of Internet"" talks at various districts to share common online pitfalls with members of the Junior Police Call and students in an interesting and interactive manner, with a view to helping them develop proper values and deepening their understanding of the COIAO. 

 OFNNA also organised various activities to help teaching staff members strengthen their relevant work in schools, including organising more than 250 school talks and three online briefing sessions for about 100 principals of primary and secondary schools or their representatives in 2024, as well as taking part in the seminars of professional development programme for teachers organised by the Education Bureau this year to introduce the COIAO and relevant activities and resources to over 200 primary school teachers. Additionally, OFNAA organises various activities for parents including talks, workshops, and webinars from time to time, working jointly with parents and schools to help children and young people establish proper values and strengthen their ability to reject harmful materials.

 OFNAA will continue to take forward diverse publicity and public education work and work with various stakeholders to enhance public awareness of the COIAO and promote the message of staying away from obscene and indecent content online."
Speech by CE at Hong Kong Association for External Friendship Inauguration Ceremony (English only),2025-07-05 15:41,2025-07-05 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500546.htm,"ââFollowing is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship Inauguration Ceremony today (July 5):

Ladies and gentlemen, when I was making preparation for this occasion, my colleagues told me that because we are talking about friendship, I should make three speeches, one in Cantonese, one is Putonghua and one in English. Indeed, Hong Kong focuses on efficiency and good use of time. For your benefit, don't worry, I am going to speak in English because this is an occasion for external friendship.

 Honorable Commissioner Cui Jianchun (Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Secretary General Sun Xueqing (Secretary General of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries), Professor Priscilla Leung (Founding President and Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. I am pleased to join you today to celebrate the inauguration of the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship.

 Today, we will witness not only the beginning of an association, but also the initiation of a new force for global dialogue. A new impetus that facilitates people-to-people exchange, and cultivates friendships.

 Because where better to make friends, and keep them, than in Hong Kong?

 Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage.

 We boast a long tradition of the rule of law, and have a common law system similar to many global financial centres. We are home to five of the world's top 100 universities, and the world's four most international universities – they not only help to nurture a workforce that's bilingual and well-versed with both Mainland and international practices, but also attract a world of students, researchers, and teachers to our city.

 Our simple and transparent tax regime, world-class infrastructure, and the free flow of information, capital, goods and people, make it easy to work, study, or simply live here. To add to all that, our superb location means we're just a five-hour flight from half of the world's population.

 China, our country, supports Hong Kong in deepening international engagement, putting a primacy on co-operation, regionally and globally – in business, trade, finance, education, culture and every other area that governments, companies and peoples can come together for mutually rewarding opportunities.

 The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is dedicated to boosting Hong Kong's relations with different economies. And the results have been recognised by international investors and corporations.

 A week ago, an international newspaper published an article that analysed Hong Kong's thriving stock market, which ranks first, globally, in IPO fundraising so far this year.

 It noted that institutional investors are returning, adding: ""Hong Kong continues to hold appeal as a gateway for Chinese capital and a bridge for international investors seeking exposure to Chinese growth"". Noting that this role of Hong Kong ""remains difficult to replicate"", it added that to dismiss our rebound is ""to overlook the changing dynamics under way"". I think it describes it perfectly.

 Yes, in these times of economic uncertainties, Hong Kong remains a financial harbour wide open to the world, and a world of free and unfettered trade. All thanks to the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and Hong Kong's unique role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" in building bridges among different economies.

 I am delighted to note that the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship is committed to becoming a bridging connector in its own vital way.

 The Association is formed under the guidance of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and focuses on cultivating ""four friendships"" – with cities, associations, organisations and individuals. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of soft power and a critical complement to official diplomatic channels.

 Diplomacy, both public and international, helped inspire the success of last December's Global University Presidents and Leaders Summit – a landmark event organised by the Association that brought together university leaders from around the world in Hong Kong.

 Today's ceremony symbolises a deeper commitment to building bridges between Hong Kong and the world. Creating an organisation, and a way forward, based on dialogue, mutual understanding and collaboration.

 In today's complex and rapidly evolving global landscape, where co-operation is no longer a given, we must unite and remain open to dialogue, to maintaining friendly relations with different places that are eager to pursue development, very much like us. That makes the Association, and its mission, more crucial than ever. For that, I am grateful – grateful to its founder, Professor Priscilla Leung, and all those who have contributed to its establishment.

 The HKSAR Government looks forward to working with you, to empowering the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship to become a dynamic force for international goodwill and co-operation.

 Ladies and gentlemen, for those of you who checked the weather, you may notice a tropical storm is on its way to this part of the globe and could bring us some rainy and windy days.

 To those who ask, ""Can bridges survive storms?"" We always point to our harbour. For centuries, typhoons have battered our shores. But Hong Kong, long a free port, has always provided a safe shelter for ships, seafarers and traders. Even in the harshest of storms and headwinds, Hong Kong will remain a safe and stress-tested harbour. We may not be able to change the global current, but united, we can sail together and chart our common course of co-operation and friendship.

 Together, we will realise a global community of shared future, rooted in economic and cultural harmony and people-to-people connectivity. A flourishing and sustainable future for each and everyone of us.

 Thank you very much."

Third phase of Rule of Law Education Train-the-Leaders Programme trains youth leaders as ROLE ambassadors (with photos),2025-07-05 15:08,2025-07-05 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500343.htm,"The third phase of the foundation course of the Rule of Law Education (ROLE) Stars Train-the-Leaders (TTL) Programme was officially launched today (July 5) by the Department of Justice (DoJ). The two-day course, which covers topics relevant to the rule of law and daily life, provides training to about 120 trainees from district youth committees in the 18 districts and a local university about knowledge on the rule of law in a diversified, interactive, and easy-to-understand manner, encouraging them to become ROLE ambassadors and actively promote the rule of law in their daily lives and work.

The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the President of the Education University of Hong Kong, Professor John Lee, delivered opening remarks for the event. Mr Lam expressed the hope that this Programme would enhance the trainees' understanding of the legal system and the rule of law in Hong Kong, as well as their capability in promoting the rule of law as youth leaders and educators in the future, consolidating their role as leaders in the rule of law education.

  On the first day of the course, Mr Lam gave a lecture on the topic of ""Rule of law and our legal system"". He elaborated to the trainees on the essence of the rule of law concept, presented an overview on Hong Kong's legal and judicial systems, and explained to them the relationship between the rule of law and the Constitution, the Basic Law, the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and ""one country, two systems"".

Member of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) and Member of the Legislative Council, Dr Starry Lee, took part in the Programme as a speaker again to explain to the trainees about the Mainland legal system and the functions of the NPC and state institutions.

The trainees of the third phase of the Programme include members of the District Youth Community Building Committees and District Youth Development and Civic Education Committees in the 18 districts, as well as students of the Education University of Hong Kong. The second day event of the TTL Programme and its graduation ceremony will be held on July 12 and certificates will be presented to trainees who have completed the course.

The third phase of the TTL Programme carries on its legacy and forges ahead with an advanced course and a newly added extended course, with a view to further deepening the understanding of the legal system and the implementation of procedures for trainees who have completed the foundation course. The content of the advanced course includes visits to law enforcement agencies and mock court activities, enabling trainees to gain a first-hand experience of the practice of the rule of law. The new extended course provides thematic talks on specific legal topics, such as a thematic talk on the cyber world which was organised earlier, along with practice activities for promoting the rule of law.

Third phase of Rule of Law Education Train-the-Leaders Programme trains youth leaders as ROLE ambassadors,2025-07-05 15:08,2025-07-05 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500343.htm,"The third phase of the foundation course of the Rule of Law Education (ROLE) Stars Train-the-Leaders (TTL) Programme was officially launched today (July 5) by the Department of Justice (DoJ). The two-day course, which covers topics relevant to the rule of law and daily life, provides training to about 120 trainees from district youth committees in the 18 districts and a local university about knowledge on the rule of law in a diversified, interactive, and easy-to-understand manner, encouraging them to become ROLE ambassadors and actively promote the rule of law in their daily lives and work.

The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the President of the Education University of Hong Kong, Professor John Lee, delivered opening remarks for the event. Mr Lam expressed the hope that this Programme would enhance the trainees' understanding of the legal system and the rule of law in Hong Kong, as well as their capability in promoting the rule of law as youth leaders and educators in the future, consolidating their role as leaders in the rule of law education.

  On the first day of the course, Mr Lam gave a lecture on the topic of ""Rule of law and our legal system"". He elaborated to the trainees on the essence of the rule of law concept, presented an overview on Hong Kong's legal and judicial systems, and explained to them the relationship between the rule of law and the Constitution, the Basic Law, the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and ""one country, two systems"".

Member of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) and Member of the Legislative Council, Dr Starry Lee, took part in the Programme as a speaker again to explain to the trainees about the Mainland legal system and the functions of the NPC and state institutions.

The trainees of the third phase of the Programme include members of the District Youth Community Building Committees and District Youth Development and Civic Education Committees in the 18 districts, as well as students of the Education University of Hong Kong. The second day event of the TTL Programme and its graduation ceremony will be held on July 12 and certificates will be presented to trainees who have completed the course.

The third phase of the TTL Programme carries on its legacy and forges ahead with an advanced course and a newly added extended course, with a view to further deepening the understanding of the legal system and the implementation of procedures for trainees who have completed the foundation course. The content of the advanced course includes visits to law enforcement agencies and mock court activities, enabling trainees to gain a first-hand experience of the practice of the rule of law. The new extended course provides thematic talks on specific legal topics, such as a thematic talk on the cyber world which was organised earlier, along with practice activities for promoting the rule of law. This aims to strengthen trainees' legal knowledge and encourage them to organise and participate in various community promotion projects on their own, taking on the roles of promoters and leaders of the rule of law education.

S for Housing visits Barcelona (with photos),2025-07-05 15:05,2025-07-05 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070400495.htm," The Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, commenced her visit to Barcelona, Spain, yesterday (July 4, Barcelona time).

 In the morning, Ms Ho met with Deputy Mayor of Barcelona Mr Jordi Valls Riera, who oversees housing policies, economic affairs and tourism matters. They exchanged views on areas such as housing policies and construction technologies. Ms Ho shared Hong Kong's experience in expeditiously building government-led Light Public Housing (LPH) using Modular Integrated Construction (MiC). For instance, the first LPH project at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, took only about one year to complete. As for the Choi Hing Road project in Ngau Tau Kok, which is the first 19-storey LPH project with elevators, its first phase was completed in less than one and a half years, breaking the record for rapid construction of high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. She also shared that the Housing Bureau (HB) and the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) have been continuously optimising Hong Kong's housing ladder to encourage more young people and families to move up the housing ladder. She mentioned that the HB will organise an international symposium to be held in Hong Kong in November this year, to showcase to the world the latest developments of construction technologies in Mainland China and Hong Kong. She expressed hope that friends from around the world could attend the symposium.

 Afterwards, Ms Ho visited a social housing project, Modulus Matrix: 85 Social Housing, which used timber frame construction to reduce carbon emissions and a modular design to shorten construction time.

 In the afternoon, Ms Ho toured a social housing project, APROP-Glòries, which was converted from containers to provide temporary accommodation to people in need. Ms Ho said that both the Hong Kong and Barcelona governments are dedicated to increasing their housing supply with swift and pragmatic approaches, and providing accommodation to families with urgent housing needs. She said she hoped that the two places would continue holding close exchanges on relevant initiatives.

 Ms Ho then paid a courtesy call on the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Barcelona, Ms Meng Yuhong, to share with her various housing initiatives being implemented by the HB, which include promoting the development of housing construction technologies by leveraging the strengths of the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

 Ms Ho today (July 5, Barcelona time) visited another social housing project, 72 Social Housing Units, to see its architectural design that creates a simple, livable and energy-efficient living environment.

 Concluding the trip, Ms Ho said, ""Hong Kong enjoys the unique advantage of having the strong support of the motherland while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world, as well as the strategic geographical location of being connected to the GBA. This visit demonstrated how Hong Kong gives full play to its important roles as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder'. I look forward to maintaining close exchanges with Portugal and Spain in areas including innovative construction technologies, people-oriented 'Well-being design' concepts and sustainable smart city development, and exploring further collaboration to create more opportunities for the industries and enterprises of the three places.""

 Ms Ho will return to Hong Kong tomorrow morning (July 6)."

何永賢上午與負責房屋政策、經濟及旅遊事務的巴塞羅那副市長Jordi Valls Riera會面，就房屋政策、建屋科技等範疇交流。何永賢分享由香港政府主導的「簡約公屋」以「組裝合成」建築法（MiC）快速興建，其中位於元朗攸壆路的首個「簡約公屋」項目，建築期只需約一年，而首個高至19層有升降機的牛頭角彩興路項目，第一期更以少於一年半的時間便落成，破了香港快速興建高層建築的紀錄。她亦分享了房屋局及香港房屋委員會（房委會）透過不斷優化置業階梯，讓更多年輕人、家庭循房屋階梯上進上流。她表示，房屋局今年十一月在香港舉行國際性研討會，向世界展示內地和香港建築科技的最新發展，希望到時世界各地的朋友都可以參加該研討會。

其後，何永賢參觀了一個社會房屋項目Modulus Matrix: 85 Social Housing。該項目採用木結構興建以減少碳排放，並以模組化設計縮短施工時間。

下午，何永賢參觀一個由貨櫃改裝而成的社會房屋項目APROP-Glòries，為有需要市民提供臨時居所。她表示，香港和巴塞羅那政府均致力以靈活務實的方法增加房屋供應，為有迫切住屋需要的家庭提供安居之所，她期望兩地就相關政策保持緊密交流。

何永賢隨後禮節性拜會中華人民共和國駐巴塞羅那總領事孟宇宏，向她介紹房屋局現正積極推行的各種房屋措施，包括借力粵港澳大灣區內地城市，推進建屋科技發展。

何永賢今日（巴塞羅那時間七月五日）參觀了另一個社會房屋項目72 Social Housing Units，實地了解當地如何透過建築設計打造樸素、宜居，並具能源效益的居住環境。

何永賢在總結訪問行程時表示：「香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，具備連繫大灣區的優越地理位置，是次訪問正正發揮香港作為『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的重要功能。我期望能與葡萄牙和西班牙就創新建築科技、以人為本的『幸福設計』及可持續智慧城市發展等領域保持緊密交流，並探討如何進一步加強合作，為三地業界和企業拓展機遇。」

何永賢將於明日（七月六日）上午返抵香港。"

Mr Roden Tong (President of the Law Society of Hong Kong), Mr Liu Chunhua (Director-General of the Department of Law of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Mr Cao Hailei (Deputy Director of the Justice Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality),

Good morning everyone! It is my great pleasure to join you at today's opening ceremony of ""Teen Talk GBA Study Tour 2025"" organised by the Law Society of Hong Kong.

Our youth today are the leaders of tomorrow. I am pleased to note that the Law Society has empowered over 18 000 students through Teen Talk since 2009, fostering essential values such as empathy, team work and respect for the rule of law.

In recent years, the Greater Bay Area (GBA) has emerged as one of the world's most significant economic zones. This dynamic region represents the successful collaboration between Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, leveraging their complementary strengths to create exceptional opportunities for talented individuals like yourselves.

As Asia-Pacific's premier hub for international legal services, Hong Kong's established common law tradition provides distinctive expertise in bridging different legal systems. We should leverage our unique advantages and reinforce our connectivity with both the Mainland and the world, offering our unique contribution as the GBA continues its remarkable development.

It is therefore most timely for the Law Society to organise this second edition of cross-boundary Study Tour to Shenzhen. I would also like to welcome our participants assembled here today. Over the next two days, you will visit leading institutions, as Roden has mentioned, including the Qianhai People's Court and the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration, gaining valuable insights into cross-jurisdictional legal systems. I am sure that the volunteer solicitors who are joining today will be most happy to share their experience and broaden your understanding of legal practice.

I encourage you to approach this unique experience with intellectual curiosity, and embrace this opportunity for learning and meaningful exchanges.

I wish you all a highly successful and fruitful study tour. Enjoy!"

各位朋友，早晨。首先很歡迎大家出席今日的法治教育領袖培訓計劃基礎課程。轉眼間，今日已經是第三年舉辦計劃。三年來都經歷了一些事情，今年可以說是有新有舊、新舊交替。

第一個新舊交替是我們的星級嘉賓陣容，有自從我們成立了法治教育委員會和開展法治教育培訓教育之後的「鐵粉」和忠實支持者——德高望重的陳兆愷法官。第二位，一樣德高望重的當然是Starry李慧琼，她不只支持，一會兒亦會和我一起跟大家分享。第三位就是在大學時讀書比我出色很多的簡慧敏議員。這些是舊朋友。但是今日很榮幸有幾位新朋友，有法治教育督導委員會的新成員何建宗博士Henry，他與我相識多年。今日有教育大學的朋友積極參與，有顧敏康博士，我有拜讀他的著作。

第二個新舊交替就是我們成員的背景，今日大概有120位朋友參加課程，大概有一半是來自18區的青年事務委員會。過去幾年，其實都曾邀請過他們，但似乎都是供不應求，所以希望今年可以補足過去的一些不足，這是舊的部分，或者稱為已經在做的部分，但部分新的東西是今年的新嘗試，很高興得到教育大學的支持，邀請到大約60位不同班級的教育大學朋友參加今日的課程，所以這是一個新的嘗試。

第三個新舊交替，就是內容和講者，關於課程內容，當然大致上是承接過去兩年的經驗，有些我們覺得是值得保留會再繼續做，但我們會與時並進，亦有加入了一些新內容和大家分享。至於講者，今日暫時是舊的，就是我和很有經驗的講者李慧琼Starry，但是下星期就會有新面孔，下星期再和大家說。所以這就是三個方面的新舊交替。

在新舊交替之餘，有一樣東西是三年來都沒有改變的，就是舉辦這個法治教育培訓計劃的目的和理念。我想花一點時間去解釋為甚麼要舉辦這個計劃，為甚麼要花你們兩個周末的時間。目標很簡單，顧名思義，就是希望培養一些法治教育的領袖。法治是甚麼呢？剛才同事也說了，在香港是不會有爭議的，我們都覺得香港是一個法治的社會，這件事很珍貴，亦可以說是我們的金漆招牌。但是法治最重要的不是法律知識，而是法治的概念和意識，是一些價值觀。價值觀的特性是甚麼呢？就等於其他價值觀，就是做人要孝順、要勤勞，是要從小培養的一些事情。

那麼如果要培養尤其是香港下一代有這樣的價值觀，哪些人最適合做這項工作呢？答案一定是最有機會接觸年青人的朋友，這包括今日出席的兩批人——負責青年事務的朋友以及未來的老師。他們自己也是年青人，所以這是很順理成章的事情。大家亦理解，無論是從事青年工作也好，或者是未來的老師也好，今時今日已經有很多相關的責任給了你們，可能大家也耳熟能詳，我們需要教授下一代，或者自己也要認識多一點國家的憲法、《基本法》，甚至是國安法的相關知識。我也很理解大家本身已有自己的工作或專長，法律不是你們很熟悉的事情，也不是你們的專長。我相信你心底也難免會有一定的疑慮或者擔心，覺得自己是否應付得來呢？是否真的可以做到這個責任，將一些相關的知識傳授給學生及其他青年朋友呢？

事實上教育局或其他機構都做了很多功夫，為大家提供了很多書面教材或其他資料幫助大家。這些是很正面的，但是我覺得要警惕一事，這也是為何我要親自跟大家交流一下。千萬不要太過依賴教材，變成一部「人肉錄音機」——就是拿着教材由頭讀到尾，讀完放下便算，這是要避免及盡量不要做的事情。要不當成「人肉錄音機」，我想有兩件事情是要做到和自己也要擁有的，就是兩個「信」字。第一是要有信念，真誠信念。你不相信那事情，你是不會教得好的。例如你不明白、不相信孝順是一種美德的話，你很難解釋給別人聽為何孝順是一件好的事情。所以你要對法治或者整個法治概念有真誠的信念，相信這事情是好的，相信這對香港是很重要的事情。所以第一是真誠的信念。

第二是要有足夠的信心。你有信心才會放膽說，不會有很多避忌，或者怕說錯就盡量少說一點，甚至依書直說便算，所以真誠的信念和足夠的信心是很關鍵的。這些道理說說當然容易，但要有信念和信心，當然不是那麼簡單，也不可以如「清兵」一樣心口寫個「勇」字便行。信念也好，信心也好，都要有一個客觀的基礎，這就是這個課程的目的。我很希望透過這個計劃，用兩個周末的時間，以一個比較全面的方法，嘗試由淺入深、化繁為簡，增加大家對於我們整個法治環境的信念，增加大家向其他人介紹這方面知識的一些信心。

我以前打過一個比喻，這個課程是等於派了一顆「定心丸」給大家，替大家打支「強心針」，讓大家更加有信心和信念去履行將來向其他人傳授法治理念的工作。當然，在座也有老師和其他人，一會兒我也會扮演這個角色，「班門弄斧」一下，但是除了講課之外，我是希望多一點互動的元素。

我鼓勵大家除了聆聽我和Starry講話之外，也可以一邊聆聽一邊思考，如果有甚麼問題的話，稍後有很多機會給大家討論，還有發問及回應問題環節。今日我們也邀請了過去兩年參加課程的學員擔任小組組長，引導大家做小組討論。我認為教學相長是要互動的，所以你們心裏面有甚麼疑問和問題，就算是你平時不敢問的，今日你絕對可以問。你「夠膽」問，我便「夠膽」回答，我是願意回答的。最後，希望經過這兩個周末之後，大家不會認為是浪費了兩個寶貴的周末，是有所得着，讓大家增加對法治的信念，讓大家更加有信心去履行你們將來的一些責任和工作。祝大家有個愉快、充實的周末，多謝大家。"

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-05 11:14,2025-07-05 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500323.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."
​行政長官在善德關愛科研青年發展計劃----第八屆北京、西安航天科技考察團啟動禮致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-07-05 11:00,2025-07-05 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070400625.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（七月五日）在慶祝中國航天日10周年「善德關愛科研青年發展計劃——第八屆中國航天之旅北京、西安航天科技考察團」啟動禮的視像致辭：

藍國慶主席（香港善德基金會主席）、董吳玲玲主席（香港善德基金會榮譽主席）、各位嘉賓、各位同學：

大家好，我很高興通過視頻參與善德關愛科研青年發展計劃的北京、西安航天科技考察團啟動禮。

今年四月二十四日，是第十個「中國航天日」，亦是國家發射第一顆人造衞星的55周年紀念日。數十年以來，國家航天事業取得了舉世矚目的成就——從「嫦娥」探月、「天問」探火，到「天宮」空間站的建成，都展示了國家建設航天強國的堅實步伐。

香港善德基金會緊扣時代脈搏，除了熱心推動社會公益事業，亦通過舉辦創科和文化交流活動，培養香港年輕一代的家國情懷和創新精神。

基金會自二○一五年起持續舉辦國家航天科技考察團。同學們通過參觀國家級的航天和科研機構、歷史名勝等，親身見證國家航天及創科發展的輝煌成就，同時增進對國家歷史文化的認識。我肯定基金會多年來的工作和努力。

特區政府積極配合國家教育強國建設規劃，持續加強在學校推動STEAM（科學、科技、工程、藝術和數學）及創科教育，從小培養學生對科學和創新科技的興趣和能力。

新開設的小學科學科課程和更新的初中科學科課程，將會加強航天與創新科技元素，提升學生對國家航天事業的了解，激發他們探索浩瀚宇宙的熱情。

在國家的支持下，香港的大學科研團隊多次參與國家的航天任務，為國家的航天事業發展貢獻力量。特區政府在InnoHK創新香港研發平台下成立了香港太空機械人與能源中心，由多所香港和內地大學，以及航天機構合作，為國家的嫦娥八號探月任務作出貢獻。

此外，獲選為國家預備航天員的香港載荷專家，最快於下年首次執行飛行任務。這次是首次有港人獲選為國家預備航天員，不但標誌着國家對香港科研人才實力的肯定，更證明年輕人只要積極裝備自己，以堅毅不屈的精神追求理想，航天夢絕非遙不可及。

同學們，這次考察團不但是一次學習之旅，更是一次為夢想播種的旅程。我期望你們以這次創科考察為起點，將對航天的熱情轉化為不斷學習的動力，自強不息，貢獻國家、造福社會。

最後，我預祝航天科技考察團圓滿成功，各位同學滿載而歸，在座各位身體健康，生活愉快。多謝大家。"
勞工及福利局局長就補充勞工優化計劃以及大班麵包西餅和鴻星海鮮酒家結業事件會見傳媒談話內容,2025-07-05 10:31,2025-07-05 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500288.htm,"​以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（七月五日）上午出席電台節目後，就補充勞工優化計劃以及大班麵包西餅和鴻星海鮮酒家結業事件會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：剛才講到有些大企業會一併計算員工總數以符合二比一這比例，勞工處會如何巡查？

勞工及福利局局長：就聘用輸入勞工企業的全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例不得多於二比一這規定，確是以整間公司總人數計算，不僅限於大企業，所有申請補充勞工優化計劃的企業均按這標準處理。這不是新安排，原有補充勞工計劃下的人手比例亦是按這規定來做。

記者：如何預防企業濫用這比例，或以其他方式迴避？

勞工及福利局局長：企業無法濫用，機制下的兩名本地僱員指的是長工，長工有清晰定義，即每星期工時須達35小時或以上，短工、兼職工及散工不會計算在內。

記者：想問大班結業方面，該數千萬元欠款是否通過破欠基金處理？

勞工及福利局局長：就大班麵包西餅的個案，勞工處同事正協助受影響工友通過破產欠薪保障基金（破欠基金）取回被拖欠的薪金、代通知金及未放假期薪酬等，若有拖欠遣散費，亦可通過這途徑申領。

記者：鴻星方面，有否聯絡到僱主，是否知悉他們的意向？

勞工及福利局局長：鴻星海鮮酒家結業方面，已有約50名工友向勞工處登記求助。勞工處正與鴻星管理層商討，提醒其在《僱傭條例》下作為僱主應履行的責任，包括支付薪金及遣散費等。當然，若我們確定僱主無力償還或清付這些款項，我們會協助工友通過破欠基金取回他們應得的款額。

Remarks by SLW on Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme and database on carers,2025-07-05 10:25,2025-07-05 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500280.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, on Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme and database on carers at a media session after attending a radio programme today morning (July 5):

Reporter: Secretary, you mentioned that the Government will impose or set strict limits on hiring non-local workers, even in sectors with higher jobless rate, like catering. How can we ensure that the local recruits are getting priority on employment? You mentioned that since mid-June, there is an introduction of the four enhanced measures to prioritise local workers, has there been noticeable increase in the number of rejected applications? Also, I would like to ask about the pilot scheme to reach out to the elderly households, could you disclose more on how exactly the Government would collect those data and implement them to help those in need?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme, the design of the system is based on some important principles, in which the most important one is to ensure that local workers are given the priority to get employed first. This is achieved through the four-week local recruitment exercise. Once an employer put up an application, first of all they have to recruit locally for four weeks. That is a very vigorous process. They have to interview every local worker applied for the job. Even if he or she is not employed, the Labour Department will give them a call to make sure that they have not been mistreated. If we found out during that process that the local workers have the willingness to work and somehow the employer has not been treating him or her in a fair manner, this would possibly result in the rejection of the application for importation of labour for that employer. I just want to assure you that the whole system is a very vigorous one and we are going to make sure that the local workers are fully protected and given the priority to get employed first. It is only after that the employer has proven to us that it is not able to recruit enough workers locally, then we would consider its application for importation of labour.

  As for the pilot scheme to make use of big data to identify earlier on families that are at risk, we are going to roll out in the coming weeks. First of all we will focus on efforts in a smaller scale, starting with beneficiaries of the Scheme on Living Allowance for Low-income Carers of Persons with Disabilities, we are talking about thousands of families who are at higher risks. An example is if the carer has been admitted into hospital, under our new pilot scheme, a message would be given from the Hospital Authority to the Social Welfare Department signaling that the said family is now at risk, so that we can reach out to it to provide necessary respite service or home service to make sure those being taken care of is receiving proper care, to ensure that the risk is properly managed and all the necessary care has been given to them. Thank you very much.
