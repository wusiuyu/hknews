36 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2026-02-16 18:40,2026-02-16 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/16/P2026021600659.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations including joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"", a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"" and joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong Customs from February 6 to yesterday (February 15). A total of 24 suspected illegal workers, nine suspected employers and three suspected aiders and abettors were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations at various Lunar New Year fairs, ImmD officers raided multiple stalls at the events. Twelve suspected illegal workers and six suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised four men and eight women, aged 18 to 52. They were found selling goods at the stalls. Two men and four women, aged 33 to 49, were suspected of employing the illegal workers. Apart from mounting enforcement operations, ImmD deployed a promotional vehicle and ImmD officers to distribute ""Don't Employ Illegal Workers"" leaflets and convey the message to Lunar New Year fair stall owners and other retailers across the territory.

  During other anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including restaurants, retail stores and garages etc. Twelve suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised three men and nine women, aged 20 to 54. Among them, two men and two women were holding recognisance forms which prohibit them from taking any employment, with one woman also being suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. The arrested suspected illegal workers were found performing dishwashing, garage mechanic and goods loading duties. Two men and one woman, aged 35 to 65, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. Furthermore, the suspected aiders and abettors arrested were three men aged 42 to 45. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

 An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

 The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or a identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

 The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

 According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

 Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

 For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
反非法勞工行動拘三十六人（附圖）,2026-02-16 18:40,2026-02-16 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/16/P2026021600655.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於二月六日至昨日（二月十五日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」、聯同食物環境衛生署及康樂及文化事務署執行的「驚愕行動」以及聯同香港警務處及香港海關執行的聯合行動。行動中共拘捕二十四名懷疑非法勞工、九名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及三名協助及教唆者。

於各區年宵市場展開的反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員巡查多個年宵市場攤檔，共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工及六名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為四男八女，年齡介乎十八至五十二歲。被捕時，他們正在攤檔從事銷售工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩男四女，年齡介乎三十三至四十九歲。在執法的同時，入境處亦安排宣傳車及職員到全港各區向年宵市場檔主及其他商戶派發宣傳單張，呼籲切勿聘用非法勞工。

於其他反非法勞工行動中，調查人員亦搜查了多個目標地點，包括食肆、零售店及車房等，共拘捕十二名懷疑非法勞工。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為三男九女，年齡介乎二十至五十四歲，當中兩男兩女持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），而其中一名女子同時涉嫌行使及管有偽造身份證。被捕的懷疑非法勞工從事洗碗、車場技工、搬運等工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為兩男一女，年齡介乎三十五至六十五歲。此外，被捕的協助及教唆者為三名男子，年齡介乎四十二至四十五歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。
	

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-16 17:30,2026-02-16 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/16/P2026021600629.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 16), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, both of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.
	

The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and

多謝行政長官。各位傳媒朋友，大家好。今日很高興來到觀塘區的年宵市場，與市民一起感受新年的氣氛。

今日相當溫暖，大家都可以留意天文台公布，能否打破最熱除夕的紀錄。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）今年在全港設立14個年宵市場，提供1 500個攤位，包括900個濕貨攤位，主要售賣各種年花；另有600多個乾貨攤位及20多個熟食攤位。

今年攤位競投氣氛十分熱烈，總成交價比往年增加了百分之三十二，相信各檔主對今年的生意很有信心。剛才亦有檔主跟我們說，今年生意比過去更好。事實上，今年到訪年宵的人流的確多了，首五日已有超過190萬人次，較去年同期增加差不多兩成，所以我們見到整個市道和氣氛比去年更好。

為讓入場的市民可以盡興，食環署在各個年宵市場不僅會播放賀年音樂，大家都聽到了，更增設多個特色「打卡點」，有些是「清潔龍」，亦有其他特色，並有安排舞獅、派發紀念品等等，都很受市民歡迎。整體而言，今年的年宵市場無論在氣氛、安排，甚至生意上，都比去年更上一層樓，相信檔主和市民都感受到濃厚的節日氣氛。藉此機會，我感謝多個政府部門的支持，令年宵市場取得成功。

今晚各區年宵市場均會通宵開放，歡迎市民在團年飯後前來逛花市，迎接新一年。我在這裏祝各位市民和傳媒朋友，馬年事事順意，新春大吉。

多謝大家。"

行動至今，海關共偵破九宗懷疑非法走私針劑及藥物的案件，並檢獲約十萬枝懷疑受管制針劑，以及三十四萬粒及六十公斤懷疑受管制藥物，估計市值超過一億四千萬元。當中，六宗案件利用郵包和貨運渠道偷運針劑入境，其餘三宗案件則涉及以海路走私針劑及藥物出境。

行動中共有四人被捕，年齡介乎26至61歲，其中三名懷疑為郵包收件人，另一名懷疑為網店負責人。

上述案件仍在調查中，不排除有更多人被捕。

海關會繼續透過風險評估和情報分析嚴厲執法，打撃跨境走私活動。

走私屬嚴重罪行，根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。任何人在沒有有效入口許可證下入口藥劑產品及藥物，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁兩年。

根據《藥劑業及毒藥條例》，任何人未有按照條文的規定而管有毒藥表第1部所列任何毒藥，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁兩年。

Hong Kong Customs steps up enforcement operations to combat smuggling activities of controlled injections and medicines (with photos),2026-02-16 16:46,2026-02-16 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/16/P2026021600356.htm,"In view of the increasing demand for injections and medicines from society and an upward trend of related smuggling cases, Hong Kong Customs has conducted special operations since late January to strengthen enforcement against the smuggling of controlled injections and medicines.

Since the operations, Customs has detected nine suspected smuggling cases of controlled injections and medicines. Approximately 100 000 vials of injections, as well as 340 000 tablets and 60 kilograms of suspected controlled medicines, with an estimated market value of over $140 million, have been seized. Among them, six cases involved inbound smuggling of injections through parcel and cargo channels, while the remaining three cases involved outbound smuggling of injections and medicines by sea.

During the operations, four persons aged between 26 and 61 were arrested. Among them, three were suspected recipients of the parcels, while the remaining one was a suspected online shop operator.

Investigations of the above-mentioned cases are ongoing, and the likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

Customs will continue to combat cross-boundary smuggling activities with firm enforcement action based on risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. Any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for two years.

Under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance, any person who possesses any poison included in Part 1 of the Poisons List other than in accordance with provisions commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for two years.

我亦利用此機會多謝各位記者朋友來採訪，亦多謝各位新聞工作者過去一年年中無休，特別是大時大節，都不斷做採訪，令我們更了解過時過節的熱烈氣氛，多謝大家。在此恭祝各位新聞工作者馬年工作順利，亦祝願各位「鐵腳、馬眼、神仙肚」的記者們，新聞報道一馬當先。

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2026-02-16 16:30,2026-02-16 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/16/P2026021600481.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月十六日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在二月八日至十四日期間，中心錄得兩宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案。兩名病人均有長期病患，詳情如下：


72歲女病人，居於中西區；及
66歲男病人，居於觀塘區。


中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示兩宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至二月十四日，今年錄得九宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二五年及二○二四年分別錄得167及135宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池、加濕器和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米或以下，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。


市民可參閱衞生防護中心退伍軍人病專頁、預防退伍軍人病委員會「預防退伍軍人病工作守則」及「適用於樓宇管理的冷熱水系統內務管理指引」；及衞生防護中心防控退伍軍人病的風險為本策略。

此外，由於吸煙和酗酒人士較易感染退伍軍人病，政府呼籲市民不要吸煙和避免飲酒。市民可致電衞生署綜合戒煙熱線1833 183由註冊護士提供接聽服務，為吸煙者進行專業戒煙輔導，並可轉介至多元化的免費戒煙服務。市民亦可瀏覽戒煙專題網頁（www.livetobaccofree.hk）以獲取更多戒煙相關資訊。衞生署亦已推出「戒酒輔導服務先導計劃」，透過受資助的非政府機構東華三院，為被識別為懷疑有酒精依賴的人士提供免費輔導。衞生署「活出健康新方向」網站已上載有關服務的簡介，有興趣參與先導計劃的合資格人士可致電東華三院查詢熱線（2884 9876）。"

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2026-02-16 16:30,2026-02-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/16/P2026021600485.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 16) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From February 8 to 14, the CHP recorded two community-acquired LD cases. Both patients involved had underlying illnesses. The details of the cases are as follows:


a 72-year-old female patient living in Central and Western District; and
a 66-year-old male patient living in Kwun Tong District.


​​The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these two cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

  As of February 14, nine LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2025 and 2024, there were 167 and 135 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpool spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or ships.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


​The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) or less and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.


​The public may visit the CHP'sLD page, theCode of Practice for Prevention of LDand theHousekeeping Guidelines for Cold and Hot Water Systems for Building Managementof the Prevention of LD Committee, and the CHP'srisk-based strategyfor prevention and control of LD.

Additionally, as smokers and alcoholics are more susceptible to LD, the Government urgesmembers of the public to quit smoking and avoid drinking. Members of the public may call the DH Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline at 1833 183, which is answered by registered nurses who provide professional counselling and referral to a wide range of free smoking cessation services. The public may also visit the smoking cessation thematic website (www.livetobaccofree.hk) for more information on smoking cessation. The DH has also launched the Pilot Alcohol Cessation Counselling Service, which provides free counselling to people identified as having probable alcohol dependence, through a subvented non-governmental organisation, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals (TWGHs). Information on the service has been uploaded to the DH'sChange for Healthwebsite. Eligible persons who are interested can call the enquiry hotline of the TWGHs (2884 9876)."

Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 36, at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) on February 14, and seized about 91 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $372,300 and a duty potential of about $300,200, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the Courts today.

As well, Customs officers intercepted an incoming female passenger, aged 42, at HKIA on the same day, and seized about 74 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $302,500 and a duty potential of about $243,900, from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. She was sentenced to five months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the Courts today.

Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentences have imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

​兩名入境旅客處理及管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2026-02-16 16:11,2026-02-16 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/16/P2026021600534.htm,"兩名入境旅客因處理和管有未完稅香煙，以及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（二月十六日）在西九龍裁判法院各被判處監禁五個月和六個月及罰款一千元。

海關人員於二月十四日在香港國際機場截查一名三十六歲的抵港男旅客，並在他的個人行李內檢獲約九萬一千支未完稅香煙，估計市值約三十七萬二千三百元，應課稅值約三十萬零二百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日在上述裁判法院被判處監禁六個月及罰款一千元。

此外，海關人員於同日在機場截查一名四十二歲的抵港女旅客，並在她的個人行李內檢獲約七萬四千支未完稅香煙，估計市值約三十萬二千五百元，應課稅值約二十四萬三千九百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。她今日在上述裁判法院被判處監禁五個月及罰款一千元。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，香煙屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"

""Trends of Infant Mortality in Hong Kong, 1951 to 2024""

Infant mortality refers to death of those aged below 1 year old. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is the number of registered infant deaths in a year per 1 000 registered live births in that year. IMR is a useful indicator of the health status not only of infants, but also of the whole population and of the socio-economic conditions under which they live.

This feature article describes the trends of infant mortality in Hong Kong from 1951 to 2024 and analyses the infant mortality by sex and by major causes of deaths.

For enquiries about this feature article, please contact the Health Statistics Division, Department of Health (Tel: 3586 2996; email: enquiries@dh.gov.hk).

Published in bilingual form, the HKMDS is a compact volume of official statistics containing about 130 tables. It collects up-to-date statistical series on various aspects of the social and economic situation of Hong Kong. Topics include population; labour; external trade; National Income and Balance of Payments; prices; business performance; energy; housing and property; government accounts, finance and insurance; and transport, communications and tourism. For selected key statistical items, over 20 charts depicting the annual trend in the past decade and quarterly or monthly trend in the recent two years are also available.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on February 13 to noon today (February 16), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 388 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website
(www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 205 334 samples of food imported from Japan (including 131 413 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 45 074 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

Among the third batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 37 survey areas in February, all recorded 0 per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

The FEHD has so far released three batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in February 2026, covering 48 survey areas. Among these 48 survey areas, 47 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. January 2026, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Only one area recorded a slight increase, but the index was lower than 10 per cent.

​The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August 2025, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever (DF). At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 62 survey areas of the community, with a surveillance period of two weeks. During the surveillance period, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

二月份第三批涵蓋37個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部均為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

食環署至今已公布二○二六年二月共三批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共48個監察地區。與上月（即二○二六年一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這48監察地區中，47個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；只有一區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自二○二五年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區62個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。在監察期間，食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2026-02-15 20:34,2026-02-15 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/15/P2026021500669.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 15) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case, the fifth case this year. The CHP reiterated its reminder to parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly. The SIV remains one of the most effective methods of preventing influenza and its complications and can reduce the risk of serious complications or death from infection.

The case involves a 15-year-old boy with underlying diseases. On February 12, he developed a fever. He was sent to theAccident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre the following day (February 13) due to persistent fever and was admitted on the same day. He subsequently developed desaturation and shock, and was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of Princess Margaret Hospital for further treatment today because of worsening conditions. His respiratory specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with pneumonia and heart failure. He is currently in serious condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the boy has not yet received the 2025/26 SIV. He is a resident of a special school. A recent influenza outbreak was recorded in his school dormitory. The CHP staff has conducted site visit and advised the school to strengthen a series of infection control measures. Chemoprophylaxis against influenza was given to unaffected students and staff. The boy's family members are asymptomatic. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

So far this year, five severe paediatric influenza cases have been recorded, involving children aged between 6 months and 15 years old. Three of the affected children had not received an SIV, including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only three days before the onset of illness. As the patient was not protected by the vaccine, the case is not counted as being vaccinated. During the summer influenza season ending in early January, 25 severe paediatric influenza cases were recorded, including three fatal cases and involving children aged between 6 months to 17 years old. Among them, 20 cases (80 per cent) had not received an SIV (including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only four days before the onset of illness).

​""Although the influenza activity in Hong Kong is currently at a low, influenza activity still remains at a relatively high level in many popular travel destinations for Hong Kong citizens, such as some areas in North America and Europe. Moreover, the overall influenza activity has increased again in Korea and Japan recently, with the major circulating virus strain having changed from the earlier influenza A (H3) to influenza B. With the increase in cross-border travel and the number of incoming visitors in the Chinese New Year, the risk of influenza transmission will also increase. Moreover, based on past experience, Hong Kong's winter influenza season typically occurs in the first quarter. With the persistent cold weather and the possibility of a change in circulating virus strains, it cannot be ruled out that the influenza activity will increase again later. Receiving SIV is still one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death from infection. The public should receive vaccination as soon as possible regardless of staying locally or planning to travel abroad, as it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body for sufficient protection against the influenza virus. All individuals aged 6 months or older, except those with known contraindications, should act promptly if they have not yet received an SIV, including those who contracted influenza in the past few months, in order to safeguard personal health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""Recently, outbreaks of influenza continue to occur in schools. For children who did not join the SIV School Outreach Programme, parents should promptly bring their children toprivate doctorsenrolled in the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme to receive an SIV. In addition, the SIV coverage rate for children aged 6 months to under 2 years is only about 25 per cent. Although this represents an approximate 2 percentage point increase compared to the same period last year, it is still much lower than that of other age groups. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to allow their children to receive an SIV,"" Dr Tsui added.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially for children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, they should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

​衞生防護中心錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2026-02-15 19:45,2026-02-15 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/15/P2026021500641.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月十五日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，是今年第五宗。中心再次提醒家長應盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗。接種流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的15歲男童。他於二月十二日出現發燒，翌日（二月十三日）因持續發燒被送到明愛醫院急症室，同日入院治理。他其後出現血含氧量下降及休克，今日因情況惡化而轉到瑪嘉烈醫院兒童深切治療部接受進一步治療。他的呼吸道樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發肺炎及心臟衰竭，目前情況嚴重。

初步調查顯示，男童沒有接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗。他為一名特殊學校的宿生，他的學校宿舍最近出現流感爆發，中心人員已到該校進行視察，並建議校方加強一系列感染控制措施及向未受影響的學生及職員派發抗流感預防藥物。男童的家庭成員沒有出現病徵。中心正繼續調查。

今年至今已錄得五宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至15歲，其中三宗沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前三天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗，由於患者未能受到疫苗保護，因此個案被視為未接種疫苗）。而在一月初結束的夏季流感季節，共錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。當中，20宗（80%）個案沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前四天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港流感活躍程度目前雖然處於低水平，但在不少港人外遊的熱門目的地，季節性流感活躍程度仍處於相對高水平，例如北美洲和歐洲部分地區，而韓國與日本的整體流感活動近日亦再度回升，當地的主要流行病毒從早前的甲型（H3）流感轉為乙型流感。農曆新年跨境旅遊與訪港旅客增加，流感傳播的風險亦會上升。此外，根據過往經驗，香港冬季流感季節大多於第一季出現。天氣持續寒冷，而且流行的病毒株可能出現變化，不排除流感活躍程度稍後會再上升。接種季節性流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防季節性流感及其併發症的方法，亦可減低入院及死亡風險。市民無論留港度歲或計劃外遊，都應及早接種疫苗，因為接種疫苗後身體約需兩星期產生抗體，以對流感病毒提供足夠保護作用。所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗應盡早接種，包括在過去幾個月曾感染流感的人士，以保障個人健康。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「學校的流感爆發個案近期仍然發生，如果學童沒有參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，家長應盡快帶子女到參加疫苗資助計劃的私家醫生接種季節性流感疫苗。此外，六個月至未滿兩歲的幼兒的季節性流感疫苗接種率只有約25%，雖然較上一季度同期上升約兩個百分點，但仍遠低於其他年齡組別的接種率。中心已經透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵家長讓子女接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。
