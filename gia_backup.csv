勞工及福利局局長出席中央廣播電視總台《贏在AI+》第二季香港專場路演啟動禮致辭（只有中文）,2026-02-07 11:40,2026-02-07 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/07/P2026020700291.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局（勞福局）局長孫玉菡今日（二月七日）上午出席中央廣播電視總台《贏在AI+》第二季香港專場路演啟動禮的致辭全文：

祝小東部長 （中聯辦九龍工作部部長）、陸海天教授（香港優才及專才協會主席）、駱勇主席（香港優才及專才協會創會主席）、林振昇議員（立法會人力事務委員會副主席）、洪錦鉉議員 （立法會議員）、趙汝恆教授（香港理工大學高級副校長（研究及創新））、尊敬的葛明博士（工業專員）：

非常高興今日早上來到香港理工大學的圖書館， 讓大家一起出席見證《贏在AI+》第二季香港專場路演啟動禮。在這裡非常感謝中央廣播電視總台和香港優才及專才協會選擇在這裏舉辦路演活動，也邀請我作為今日上午的一位嘉賓，也見證了在AI（人工智能）這一領域在人才和產業的重要性。

在香港，勞福局的其中一個主要任務是為香港去 「搶人才」、「留人才」，產業這方面就要交給創科局（創新及科技局），葛明博士今日也在場。剛才陸海天教授說得非常好，他說AI是一個改變世界，決定在未來世界的競爭中誰領先、誰落後的關鍵驅動力。誰在AI領域中領跑的話，就肯定是要領跑全世界的。所以選擇在香港舉行這次啟動禮，我覺得這代表着國家對香港的重視，香港是金融中心、貿易中心、航運中心，將來一定可以成為創科中心。

作為創科中心，核心的驅動力是離不開AI的，而且以香港來說，除了AI以外，像節目中提到的AI+，這個加號可能對香港是更重要的，我對這個加號的理解就是AI的應用，即可以應用不同的場景，要更好地發揮AI的無限潛力。在這一領域，香港在過去一百多年以時間、經驗證明，香港是最能將科技轉化成產業、轉化成財富的地方，所以我很期待，所以記得現在AI+的所有參與者，要好好的用好一國兩制的制度優勢，用好香港和國際規則對接的優勢，用好香港金融中心、人才中心這個巨大的優勢。

過去數年，隨着政府提出一系列的「搶人才」政策，加上香港自身的優勢，不管從國際人才排名、創科排名都可以看到香港取得巨大進步。但是我們不會停步，這個只是開始。隨着政府的政策、資金的投入；隨着「十五五」規劃，國家對AI的重點重視，我相信我們只要用好香港的制度優勢，用好國家給香港的巨大支持，引來世界各地的優秀AI人才來港發展，一定可以做到今日央視節目所說的──《贏在AI+》，贏在香港。

歡迎大家來到香港，也祝願所有參賽者取得巨大成功，用好香港，在香港閃耀自己。

感謝大家。"

FEHD continues to actively follow up on food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters and steps up inspections of food premises,2026-02-06 23:34,2026-02-06 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600915.htm,"​A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (February 6) that the Centre for Food Safety of the FEHD continues to actively follow up on the food poisoning cases concerned. Following yesterday's announcement regarding raw oysters supplied by Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd. of Korea, the latest investigation has revealed that some cases involved the consumption of raw oysters supplied by the food factory Jeton International Food and 88 Investment Holdings Limited. For the sake of prudence, the FEHD has immediately instructed the company concerned to suspend the sale and supply of raw oysters. The trade should stop selling raw oysters supplied by the company concerned immediately if they possess them. The investigation is still ongoing.

At the same time, in view of the recent surge in food poisoning cases related to the consumption of raw oysters, the FEHD has carried out special operations and stepped up inspections of various licensed food premises across the territory to ensure that oysters to be eaten in a raw state (raw oysters) are stored at the proper temperature, thereby safeguarding food safety and protecting public health.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""The FEHD has launched a series of operations starting today, including stepping up inspections in various districts. The focuses of the inspections included the storage temperature of raw oysters, storage conditions in designated refrigerators, the sources of supply, the personal hygiene of food handlers and the hygiene condition of the premises. Operators and staff of food premises have been provided with health advice and food safety pamphlets regarding the proper way of storing and handling raw oysters.""

As stipulated under the permit/licensing conditions of the restricted food permit or written permission issued by the FEHD, all raw oysters ready for immediate consumption shall be kept in a refrigerator or compartment of a refrigerator separated from other food items at a temperature between 0 and 4 degrees Celsius. If a breach of the aforesaid condition is found, FEHD officers will, depending on the actual circumstances, issue verbal warnings or warning letters, and may even consider cancellation of the permits/licences of relevant premises.

The spokesman reminded that as oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater and absorbing suspended food particles therein, bacteria (e.g. Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus) and viruses (e.g. norovirus and Hepatitis A virus) may accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Consuming oysters without thorough cooking might risk direct intake of these microorganisms. Susceptible groups, such as pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, should avoid eating them.

The FEHD will continue to step up inspections to ensure that the licensing/permit conditions are observed by the licensees/permit holders or relevant operators, and the hygienic standards stipulated in the laws are met."
CFS continues to follow up powdered infant formula with possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus,2026-02-06 22:54,2026-02-06 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600865.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department continues to actively follow up on the precautionary recall of certain batches of powdered infant and young children formula in different areas worldwide, due to possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus in the individual raw material. The CFS noted through its Food Incident Surveillance System that certain batches of Aptamil powdered infant and young children formula are being recalled by certain areas in Europe as the products might contain Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus. The CFS has been highly concerned and actively following up on the incident. Following the announcement earlier that a local trader had imported into Hong Kong and sold one affected batch of the powdered infant formula concerned, the CFS's latest follow-up investigation today (February 6), in response to the latest announcement from Europe, revealed that the trader had imported and distributed another affected batch of the powdered infant formula. For the sake of prudence, the distributor concerned has stopped sales, removed the affected product from shelves and initiated a precautionary recall according to the CFS's instructions.

Product details are as follows:

Product name: Aptamil Profutura DUO Advance 1 800g
Brand: Aptamil
Pack size: 800 grams
Place of origin: Germany
Use-by date: April 21, 2027
Distributor: HK Wukong Trading Limited
Quantity imported and distributed: 390 cans

The CFS has found in its follow-up investigation that the abovementioned distributor had imported and distributed 65 boxes of 390 cans of the affected product. The CFS has instructed the importer, distributor and retailers concerned to stop sales and remove the affected batch of the product concerned from shelves and to initiate a recall. Members of the public may call the distributor's hotline at 6426 1511 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

The CFS will continue to enhance surveillance of powdered infant and young children formula and to closely monitor the recall matters and remain fully committed to ensuring food safety. The CFS has alerted the trade and relevant department over the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action.

Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

The CFS urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the affected batch of the product, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the product concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately.

The CFS has established a designated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/powdered_formula/index.html) to facilitate public access to more information."
Legislative amendment proposals and related measures for reforming Medical Council of Hong Kong,2026-02-06 22:42,2026-02-06 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600794.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) today (February 6) submitted a paper to the Panel on Health Services of the Legislative Council (LegCo) on the legislative amendment proposals to the Medical Registration Ordinance (MRO) (Cap. 161) formulated to support the reform of the Medical Council of Hong Kong (MCHK), with a view to ensuring that the MCHK can continue to uphold medical professional standards and discharge its statutory functions, as well as strengthening the support provided by the Department of Health (DH) and the Secretariat of the MCHK to the work of the MCHK, including relevant supporting measures to enhance the MCHK's handling of complaints concerning doctors' professional conduct.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""The Government expects the reform of the MCHK's system will bring about enhanced medical professional standards, safeguards to the health of citizens and consolidation of the mutual trust between doctors and patients, supporting Hong Kong's development into an international health and medical innovation hub. I am grateful to various stakeholders, including the MCHK, professional bodies, patient groups and other relevant stakeholders, for offering valuable views over the past few weeks. The Government will make every effort to take forward the work of amending the MRO, with a view to introducing an amendment bill into the LegCo in the first half of this year, and to implement the related reform measures progressively.""

Reforming the composition of the MCHK

  The MCHK is a statutory body established under the MRO. In accordance with the powers conferred by the legislation, it handles the registration of medical practitioners, oversees the Licensing Examination, formulates professional codes and guidelines, and conducts disciplinary inquiries into complaints involving professional misconduct of doctors. The MCHK shoulders the primary responsibility for upholding doctors' professional standards and ethical conduct. Within the framework of the MRO and relevant subsidiary legislation, the MCHK discharges its functions to enhance doctors' professional and ethical conduct; establish and promote doctors' professional standards; and strives to safeguard patients' well-being and the public interest. Over the years, Hong Kong's healthcare professional standards have enjoyed an esteemed reputation among developed economies. The MCHK plays a crucial role in ensuring doctors' professional conduct, continuously enhancing professional standards, and promoting medical innovation.

  In recent years, the MCHK has continuously adjusted and enhanced its work. These include conducting accreditation of the medical curriculum offered by local medical schools every five years, preparing and administering the Licensing Examination for non-locally trained medical graduates; arranging internship for local medical graduates and for non-locally trained doctors who have passed the Licensing Examination to ensure the overall standard of local medical education and the professional knowledge and skills of all doctors; fully supporting the Government's policy to admit non-locally trained doctors by establishing the Special Registration Committee to assess medical qualifications from different places, and recognising a total of 150 medical qualifications from different places to date; and issuing ethical guidelines on the provision of services to patients through telemedicine by doctors in response to societal needs.

  The composition of the MCHK plays a significant role in the corporate governance of the MCHK and how it discharges the functions stipulated under the MRO. At present, the MCHK has 32 members, comprising 24 medical practitioner members (75 per cent) and eight lay members (25 per cent). Among the medical practitioner members, 16 are nominated and elected by the profession, while the remaining eight medical practitioner members are from the University of Hong Kong (two), the Chinese University of Hong Kong (two), the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (HKAM)(two), the Hospital Authority (HA)(one) and the DH (one).

  To ensure the MCHK fully takes into account the views of the profession and the community (especially patients), and with reference to international developments in medical regulation, the Government proposes the composition of the MCHK be amended as follows, including:

(i) Increase the number of lay members in the MCHK (e.g. healthcare professionals other than doctors) to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration, enabling MCHK's decisions to better reflect the concerns of the public and enhance public accountability of the system;

(ii) Suitably adjust the composition of medical practitioner members, including introducing non-officio medical practitioner members directly appointed by the Government, to ensure that the professional views of the sector are represented by medical practitioner members with diverse qualifications and backgrounds; and

(iii) Include representation from primary healthcare, to ensure the MCHK's deliberations fully take into account the working environment of primary healthcare, which differs from that of the secondary and tertiary health system.

Enhancing the MCHK's complaints handling mechanism

  The MCHK has a statutory responsibility and the powers to protect patients' rights and interests. It is vested with independent quasi-judicial functions and powers to impose disciplinary sanctions through disciplinary proceedings on doctors whose professional standards or ethical conduct fall short of the required standards. Under the current arrangements of the MRO, the complaint handling mechanism generally involves three stages from the receipt of a complaint:

(i) Initial screening: the chairman and deputy chairman of the Preliminary Investigation Committee (PIC) consider whether the complaint received is frivolous or groundless. If so, the complaint may be dismissed. If not, the case must be referred to the PIC for further investigation;

(ii) Case investigation: the PIC conducts investigation into the complaint. In the process, the PIC may require the complainant or the doctor concerned to provide information for the PIC's consideration as to whether there is sufficient evidence to refer the complaint to the Inquiry Panel (IP) for inquiry; and

(iii) Disciplinary inquiry: the IP conducts inquiry into the referred case and imposes disciplinary sanctions on the doctor concerned.

  The MCHK operates an assessor system, where medical assessors are nominated by eight medical institutions or organisations (including the two local medical schools, the HA, the HKAM, the Hong Kong Medical Association), while lay assessors are nominated by six institutions or organisations (including the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Law Society of Hong Kong) to participate in the work of the PIC and the IP. At present, there are a total of 36 lay assessors and 48 medical assessors, who may be appointed as members of the PIC or IP and participate in hearings.

  In recent years, the MCHK has endeavoured to address bottlenecks in the complaints handling process. Since end-2024, it has implemented measures to improve efficiency in handling complaints, including taking stock of all cases pending inquiry, prioritising and expediting their handling and co-ordinating with legal representatives and expert witnesses for better support, enhancing the complaint handling information system and strengthening the Secretariat's monitoring of case progress to closely track the time taken at various stages of the process.

  In response to public concern last year about the MCHK's investigation and disciplinary inquiry mechanism for handling complaints, the MCHK earlier reviewed the mechanism at the request of the Secretary for Health and submitted a report to the HHB on improving the mechanism's operation to safeguard doctors' professional standards. Meanwhile, the Office of The Ombudsman conducted a full investigation into the MCHK's complaints handling mechanism and released its findings yesterday (February 5). Having considered the report submitted by the MCHK, the Office of The Ombudsman's investigation report and the views of relevant stakeholders, the Government proposes the following amendments to the MCHK's complaints handling mechanism:

(1) Require the MCHK to set target time frames for different stages of the overall complaints handling mechanism, and establish a system to monitor overall case progress;

(2) Affirm the independence of the decisions and operation of the PIC and the IP, and strengthen the participation of independent assessors in the PIC and the IP;

(3) At present, both the chairman and deputy chairman of the PIC are doctors and they handle the dismissal of frivolous complaints; it is proposed to strengthen the role of lay persons to enhance the process;

(4) Specify in the MRO the MCHK's responsibility for overseeing the work of its Secretariat, and require the Secretariat to be responsible to the MCHK for its work;

(5) Allow both the complainant and the doctor concerned to apply to the MCHK for review of the IP’s decision, or lodge an appeal to the court;

(6) When handling disciplinary proceedings involving doctors who have been convicted by the court, stipulate (save in exceptional circumstances) that the IP should adopt the court’s findings of fact made upon conviction; and

(7) If a doctor is convicted of a serious offence and sentenced to imprisonment for a specified term, the doctor may be removed from the register immediately, and any application for restoration will be handled having regard to the nature and seriousness of the offence under the disciplinary procedures and mechanism.

Continuously enhancing doctors' professional standards

  The Government has proposed legislative amendments to make continuing professional development a prerequisite for nurses, dentists and allied health professionals when renewing their practising certificates. For doctors, the MRO stipulates that registered medical practitioners whose names are included in the Specialist Register must undertake continuing medical education (CME) relevant to their specialties. To maintain doctors' professional competence, the Government is considering extending the CME requirement to non-specialist doctors (i.e. covering all registered medical practitioners) and making it a prerequisite for renewal of practising certificates.

Increasing the supply of doctors

  Under the current MRO, only Hong Kong permanent residents may practise in Hong Kong under the special registration pathway without holding a recognised specialist qualification. In addition, holders of recognised medical qualifications may sit the Licensing Examination even if they have not yet completed internship, and may apply for special registration after passing the Examination and completing the assessment period. Overseas recruitment experience shows that, the special registration pathway are not particularly attractive to non-locally trained doctors who are non-Hong Kong permanent residents. In view of the continued shortage of doctors and intensifying global competition for healthcare talent, we propose allowing both non-Hong Kong permanent residents and Hong Kong permanent residents to apply for special registration.

  The HA will continue to implement its policy of giving priority to recruiting all suitable local medical graduates, and has sufficient internship positions and specialist training places to absorb local graduates. The above amendments will not affect employment opportunities for local graduates or their opportunities to receive specialist training. The HA will continue to recruit qualified non-locally trained doctors to work in Hong Kong via the special registration and limited registration pathways according to service needs.

Strengthening support for the MCHK

  To complement healthcare policy development, the Government considers it necessary to strengthen the role of the Director of Health within the MCHK as an ex-officio member and Registrar of Medical Practitioners to suitably reflect the Government's views on policies and serve as a communication and collaboration channel between the MCHK and the Government to facilitate the MCHK in adjusting and enhancing its work to continue uplifting the professional standard of medical practitioners.

  At present, to assist the MCHK in discharging its statutory functions, the DH provides resources to establish the Secretariat. The work of the Secretariat of the MCHK is led and supervised directly by the MCHK. The Government will explore with the MCHK how to enhance the Secretariat's support to the MCHK, including supporting measures to enhance the handling of complaints concerning doctors' professional conduct, with the following proposed directions:

(1) Actively explore the establishment of a dedicated team to support complaint investigations, comprising staff with relevant professional backgrounds to investigate complaints received and support the PIC's investigation work;

(2) Actively explore increasing legal support and administrative personnel to handle the growing number of complaints, supporting the MCHK to increase the number of PICs and IPs as necessary in the future to expedite complaint handling;

(3) To expedite the obtaining of expert reports, the Government has invited the HKAM to study the establishment of a talent pool to systematically arrange experts from different medical specialties to provide advice on complaint cases and participate in inquiries regularly at the invitation of the MCHK;

(4) Provide appropriate training and support for newly appointed assessors (especially lay assessors) to ensure that they fully understand the MCHK's statutory functions and help them participate in the complaints handling process; and

(5) Explore the Secretary of the MCHK to be served by a senior management staff of the DH with professional background to enhance the functions of the Secretariat."
食環署繼續積極跟進進食生蠔食物中毒個案及加強巡查食物業處所,2026-02-06 22:40,2026-02-06 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600858.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（二月六日）表示，食環署食物安全中心繼續積極跟進有關食物中毒個案，繼昨日公佈由韓國Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd.供應的生蠔外，最新調查發現個別食物中毒個案人士曾進食由傑頓國際食品及88投資控股有限公司（Jeton International Food and 88 Investment Holdings Limited）食物製造工場供應的生蠔。為審慎起見，食環署已即時指示相關公司暫停出售及供應生蠔。業界如持有該公司供應的生蠔，應立即停售。調查仍然繼續。

與此同時，鑑於近期與進食生蠔相關的食物中毒個案有所上升，食環署亦在全港各區採取特別行動，加強巡查全港多個持牌食物業處所，確保供不經烹煮而食用的蠔（生蠔）在適當溫度下貯存，以保障食物安全及公眾健康。

食環署發言人表示：「食環署今日起展開連串行動，包括在各區加強巡查，巡查的重點包括生蠔的保存溫度、存放在指定雪櫃內的情況、生蠔的供應來源、食物處理人員的個人衞生及食物業處所的衞生情況等。食環署人員亦向食物業處所負責人和員工提供衞生教育，並派發食物安全小冊子，介紹存放和處理生蠔的正確方法。」

食環署在其發出的受限制食物售賣許可證或書面准許的持證／持牌條件中訂明，所有可供即時食用的生蠔須存放在雪櫃或其分格內，並須與其他食物分隔，而溫度須保持在攝氏零度至四度之間。如發現處所違反上述條件，食環署會視乎實際情況發出口頭或書面警告，甚至考慮取消有關處所的許可證／牌照。

發言人提醒，由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水、吸收在海水中懸浮食物粒子的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有細菌（例如副溶血性弧菌和創傷弧菌）及病毒（例如諾如病毒和甲型肝炎病毒），這些物質會在蠔的體內積聚。進食未經徹底煮熟的蠔可能會有直接攝入這些微生物的風險，孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者等容易受感染的人士，應避免進食。

食環署會繼續加強巡查，確保持牌／持證人或相關負責人遵守有關牌照或許可證條件，並符合法例訂明的衞生標準。"
Toddler suspected of Cereulide poisoning caused by Bacillus cereus after consuming powdered infant and young children formula,2026-02-06 22:09,2026-02-06 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600777.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 6) is investigating a suspected case of poisoning due to Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus involving a one-year-old girl who consumed NAN INFINIPRO2 7HMO powdered formula. She experienced diarrhoea a number of times. Since she stopped consuming the powdered formula concerned, her health condition has improved and she did not require hospitalisation. The CHP reminds the public not to feed infants or young children any batches of powdered infant and young children formula currently subject to a precautionary recall, and urges all doctors in Hong Kong to be vigilant for related cases.

The CHP received the case referral from the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Departmentyesterday (February 5). Preliminary investigation revealed that the girl's parents purchased a can of the powdered formula in question on December 30 last year and began feeding it to the girl on the same day. A few hours after consuming the powdered formula, the girl developed watery diarrhoea, experiencing it up to five times a day. During this period, she did not have a fever or other symptoms. As the girl developed diarrhoea, her parents stopped feeding her the powdered formula concerned on January 1 this year. The girl was taken to a private doctor the following day. She did not require hospitalisation. Her diarrhoea gradually improved after she stopped consuming the powdered formula concerned and switched to another unaffected product. She has not presented any symptoms now.

The CHP's investigation revealed that the batch number of the powdered formula consumed by the girl was 53070742F1, which is part of a global precautionary recall earlier this year due to the possible presence of Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus in the individual raw materials. The CFS also announced earlier this week that samples from the same batch tested positive for Cereulide.

""Given the girl's persistent symptoms after consuming the powdered formula concerned, and the compatibility of the timing and symptoms with Cereulide poisoning, we cannot rule out the possibility that she developed Cereulide poisoning from consuming the abovementioned powdered infant and young children formula. Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment and may proliferate during food processing and storage if hygiene conditions are poor. Some strains can produce Cereulide in contaminated food. Ingestion of food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus may cause symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, with the main symptoms being vomiting and diarrhoea, which usually appear within hours of consumption. Infants and young children are more susceptible to dehydration and complications. Therefore, parents should seek medical attention promptly if their infants or young children experience discomfort after consuming powdered infant and young children formula. The CHP has recently issued a letter to all doctors in Hong Kong to remind them to be vigilant about the situation regarding powdered infant and young children formula and to report suspected cases of Cereulide poisoning to the CHP,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

As at 5pm yesterday, the DH has received a total of about 50 referrals of suspected discomfort in infants following consumption of powdered formula (including the abovementioned case). Except for this one-year-old girl, the symptoms in the other cases did not match those of acute Cereulide poisoning. Most cases experienced one or two times of vomiting or loose stools, which were not persistent and did not develop any other symptoms. In a few cases with persistent symptoms, the time of symptom onset did not correlate with consumption of the products.

In addition, the DH has received 159 enquiries related to the affected powdered formula, mostly related to switching to a different powdered formula. Healthcare professionals have provided appropriate health advice and assessments. The DH reminds parents to seek medical advice promptly if their infants or young children show any symptoms of gastroenteritis after consuming the affected products, including arranging for sample tests to rule out the possibility of other communicable diseases.

The DH will continue to monitor developments and take appropriate follow-up actions."

醫務委員會改革的立法修訂建議及相關措施,2026-02-06 21:28,2026-02-06 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600755.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）今日（二月六日）向立法會衞生事務委員會提交文件，簡介為配合香港醫務委員會（醫委會）改革而制訂的《醫生註冊條例》（第161章）（《條例》）立法修訂建議，確保醫委會得以維持醫療專業水平和履行法定職責，以及加強衞生署和醫委會秘書處支援醫委會工作，包括提升醫委會處理關於醫生專業操守申訴的相關配套措施。

醫衞局局長盧寵茂教授說：「政府期望通過改革醫委會的制度，確保醫療專業水平精益求精，保障市民健康及鞏固病人和醫生之間的互信，配合香港銳意發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐。我感謝過去數星期不同持份者，包括醫委會、專業團體、病人組織和相關持份者提出寶貴意見。政府會全力推進修訂《條例》的工作，爭取在今年上半年向立法會提交條例草案，並陸續落實相關的改革措施。」

改革醫委會的組成

醫委會是根據《條例》成立的法定機構，按法例賦予的權力處理醫生註冊、監辦執業資格試、制訂專業守則與指引，及就涉及醫生專業失當的申訴進行紀律研訊。醫委會對維持醫生專業水平和操守負有主體責任，在《條例》及相關附屬法例的框架下履行職責，提升醫生的專業和道德操守，及建立和促進醫生的專業水平與標準，致力保障病人福祉和公眾利益。一直以來，香港醫護專業水平在已發展的經濟體中享負盛名，醫委會在確保醫生專業操守、持續提升專業水平，以至推動醫療創新的角色至關重要。

醫委會近年不斷調整及優化其工作，包括就本地醫學院提供的醫學課程每五年一度進行評審、籌備和舉辦非本地醫科畢業生執業資格試，以及為本地醫科畢業生和通過執業資格試的非本地培訓醫生安排駐院實習，以確保本地整體醫學教育的水平和所有醫生的專業知識和技能；全力配合政府引入非本地培訓醫生的政策，成立特別註冊委員會審核不同地區的醫學資格，至今已承認合共150項不同地區的醫學資格；以及因應社會需要就醫生使用遠程醫療為病人提供服務發出道德指引等。

醫委會的組成對醫委會的機構管治及其如何履行《條例》訂明的職能發揮重要作用。目前醫委會有32名成員，分別為24名醫生委員（75%）和八名業外委員（25%）。醫生委員當中16名由業內提名和選舉產生，其餘八名醫生則來自香港大學（兩名）、香港中文大學（兩名）、香港醫學專科學院（醫專）（兩名）、醫院管理局（醫管局）（一名）和衞生署（一名）。

為確保醫委會充分考慮專業和社會各界（尤其是病人）的意見，並參考國際醫療規管的發展，建議對醫委會的組成作出以下修訂，包括：

（一） 增加醫委會的業外人士，例如醫生以外的其他專業，促進跨專業協作，讓醫委會的決定能顧及廣大市民的關注並加強制度的公眾問責性；

（二） 適當調整醫生委員的組成，包括引入由政府直接委任的非官方醫生成員，確保有不同資歷及背景的醫生委員代表業界專業意見；及

（三） 加入基層醫療的代表，確保醫委會的討論充分考慮基層醫療有別於第二層及第三層醫療系統的工作環境。

優化醫委會處理申訴的機制

醫委會具有法定責任和權力保障病人權益，獲賦予獨立準司法職能和權力，通過紀律程序向專業水平或操守未能達標的醫生作出紀律處分。根據現行《條例》的安排，整個申訴處理機制自接獲申訴起計，一般涉及三個程序，包括：

（一） 初步篩查：由初步偵訊委員會（偵委會）主席及副主席考慮接獲的申訴是否屬於瑣屑無聊或毫無根據。如是，則可駁回申訴；如否，則必須把個案交予偵委會進一步調查；

（二） 個案調查：由偵委會負責對申訴進行調查，過程中偵委會可要求申訴人或相關醫生提供資料，供偵委會考慮有否足夠證據把申訴轉介至研訊小組進行研訊；及

（三） 紀律研訊：由研訊小組對被轉介的個案進行研訊，並對涉事醫生進行紀律處分。

醫委會轄下設有審裁員制度，由八個醫療機構或組織（包括兩所本地醫學院、醫管局、醫專、香港醫學會等）提名醫生出任醫生審裁員，以及六個機構或組織（包括香港大律師公會、香港社會服務聯會、香港會計師公會和香港律師會等）提名業外人士出任業外審裁員，參與偵委會和研訊小組的工作。現時共有36位業外及48位醫生審裁員，出任偵委會和研訊小組成員，參與聆訊工作。

醫委會近年致力解決處理申訴流程上的樽頸，自二○二四年年底推行措施改善申訴處理效率，包括重新盤點所有仍待進行研訊的個案，重點加快處理及協調法律代表、專家證人等加以配合、加強申訴處理的資訊系統，以及加強秘書處就個案進度的監管力度以密切留意程序各階段所使用的時間。

因應去年公眾對醫委會處理申訴的調查和紀律研訊機制的關注，醫委會早前應醫衞局局長要求檢視機制，並就完善機制運作以確保醫生專業水平向醫衞局提交報告。與此同時，申訴專員公署（公署）就醫委會處理申訴機制進行全面調查，並於昨日（二月五日）公布調查結果。經考慮醫委會提交的報告、公署的調查報告及相關持份者的意見，政府建議對醫委會申訴處理機制作出以下修訂：

（一） 要求醫委會為整個申訴處理機制的不同部分訂立目標時間，以及設立監察整體個案處理進度的制度；

（二） 確立偵委會和研訊小組的決定和運作的獨立性，並加強獨立審裁員在偵委會和研訊小組的參與；

（三） 現行偵委會主席和副主席均由醫生出任，處理駁回瑣屑無聊申訴，建議加強業外人士的角色以優化程序；

（四） 在《條例》列明醫委會督導秘書處工作的責任，及秘書處就工作向醫委會負責；

（五） 容許申訴人及相關醫生均可就研訊小組的裁決向醫委會申請覆核，或向法庭提出上訴；

（六） 在處理涉及已被法庭定罪的醫生的紀律程序時，除特別情況外，訂明研訊小組應採納在定罪時法庭就事實作出的裁決；及

（七） 如醫生被裁定干犯嚴重罪行且被判處監禁一定年期，該醫生可被即時從醫生名冊除名，重新註冊的申請將視乎罪行的性質及嚴重性按紀律程序及機制處理。

持續提升醫生專業水平

政府已提出法例修訂，把持續專業發展訂為護士、牙醫和專職醫療人員續領執業證明書的先決條件。在醫生方面，《條例》訂明名列專科醫生名冊的註冊醫生須接受與其專科有關的延續醫學敎育。為維持醫生的專業能力，政府考慮把延續醫學敎育的要求擴展至非專科醫生（即涵蓋所有註冊醫生），並將此規定訂為續領執業證明書的先決條件。

提升醫生人手供應

現行《條例》只容許香港永久性居民無須持有獲承認專科資格可以特別註冊途徑來港執業，以及持有獲承認醫學資格的即使尚未完成進行駐院實習亦可參加執業資格試，在考試合格後完成評核期申請特別註冊。海外招聘經驗顯示，特別註冊途徑對非香港永久性居民的非本地培訓醫生吸引力不大。考慮到醫生人手持續短缺，及面對全球招攬醫療人才的激烈競爭，我們建議容許非香港永久性居民與香港永久性居民均可申請特別註冊。

醫管局會繼續執行優先聘請所有合適的本地大學醫科畢業生的政策，並有足夠實習職位及專科培訓名額吸納本地畢業生，上述修訂不會影響本地畢業生的就業及接受專科培訓的機會。醫管局會繼續透過特別註冊及有限度註冊途徑，按服務需求聘用合資格的非本地培訓醫生來港服務。

加強醫委會支援措施

為配合醫療政策的發展，政府認為應加強衞生署署長作為醫委會當然委員及醫生註冊主任在醫委會的角色，適當反映政府政策方面的意見，作為醫委會與政府溝通協作的橋樑，促進醫委會調整及優化工作以持續提升醫生專業水平。

現時，為協助醫委會執行其法定職能，衞生署提供資源設立秘書處。醫委會的秘書處的工作由醫委會直接領導及監管。政府會和醫委會探討如何加強秘書處對醫委會的支援，包括提升醫委會處理關於醫生專業操守申訴的相關配套措施，建議方向如下：

（一） 積極探討成立專責隊伍支援申訴調查，由具相關專業背景的人員專責就接獲的申訴進行調查，支援偵委會的調查工作；

（二） 積極探討增加法律支援人員及行政人員，處理日益增加的申訴，配合日後醫委會按需要增加偵委會和研訊小組的數目以加快處理申訴；

（三） 為加快索取專家報告，政府已邀請醫專研究建立人才庫，有系統地組織不同醫學專科的專家定時按照醫委會的邀請，就申訴個案提供意見及參與研訊；

（四） 為剛上任的審裁員（尤其是業外審裁員）提供適當培訓及支援，確保他們充分了解醫委會的法定職能並幫助他們參與申訴處理的過程；及

（五） 探討由具專業背景的衞生署高級管理人員出任醫委會秘書以加強秘書處職能。"
一名幼童食用嬰幼兒配方奶粉後懷疑出現由蠟樣芽孢桿菌產生的致吐毒素中毒,2026-02-06 21:28,2026-02-06 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600754.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（二月六日）正調查一宗懷疑由蠟樣芽孢桿菌（Bacillus cereus）產生的致吐毒素中毒個案，涉及一名曾食用能恩全護2號配方7HMO奶粉的一歲女童。她曾出現多次腹瀉，而停止食用涉事配方奶粉後，健康情況已改善，無須入院治療。衞生防護中心提醒市民不要讓嬰幼兒食用正進行預防性回收的嬰幼兒配方奶粉批次，並呼籲全港醫生留意相關病例。

衞生防護中心昨日（二月五日）收到食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（食安中心）轉介上述個案。初步調查顯示，女童的家長去年（二○二五年）十二月三十日購買一罐涉事配方奶粉，該女童同日起開始進食。女童食用後數小時隨即出現腹瀉，糞便呈水狀，腹瀉次數一日達五次。其間，女童沒有出現發燒或其他病徵。由於出現腹瀉，女童的家長於今年一月一日起停止餵哺該罐配方奶粉。女童翌日被帶到私家醫生求診，無需留院治療。女童停止食用涉事配方奶粉和轉用另一款沒有受影響的產品後，腹瀉情況逐漸改善，現時已沒有任何病徵。

衞生防護中心的調查顯示，女童食用的該罐配方奶粉，批次編號為53070742F1。早前全球不同地區因為個別批次的嬰幼兒配方奶粉可能存在源自微生物蠟樣芽孢桿菌的物質而進行預防性回收，該批次是其中之一。食安中心本周初亦公布，於同批次的樣本驗出致吐毒素。

衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「考慮到女童食用涉事配方奶粉後持續出現相關病徵，時間及症狀與致吐毒素中毒吻合，我們不排除她是進食上述嬰兒配方奶粉產品後出現致吐毒素中毒。蠟樣芽孢桿菌普遍存在於環境中，在食品加工及儲存過程中，若衞生條件不佳可能滋生。部分菌株可在受污染食品中產生蠟樣芽孢桿菌毒素（一種耐熱的致嘔吐毒素）。攝入含過量蠟樣芽孢桿菌的食物可能引發急性胃腸道症狀，主要病徵是嘔吐和腹瀉。症狀通常在進食後數小時內出現，嬰幼兒更容易出現脫水及併發症。因此，家長如發現嬰幼兒食用嬰幼兒配方奶粉後不適，應盡快求醫。衞生防護中心日前已去信全港醫生，提醒他們留意相關嬰兒配方奶粉的情況，同時應向衞生防護中心呈報懷疑致吐毒素中毒個案。」

截至昨日下午五時，衞生署共收到約50宗有關嬰兒食用配方奶粉後懷疑出現不適的個案的轉介（包括上述一宗）。除了該名一歲女童外，其他個案的徵狀與致吐毒素所引起急性中毒情況不符，大部分個案僅出現一至兩次嘔吐或糞便稀爛，沒有持續，亦沒有其他症狀，而少部分有持續病徵的個案，其出現症狀的時間與進食相關產品的時間不一致。

此外，衞生署共接獲159宗與受影響配方奶粉相關的查詢，主要涉及轉換配方奶粉事宜，醫護人員已提供適當健康建議及評估。衞生署提醒家長，嬰幼兒食用相關產品後有任何腸胃炎症狀，應盡快徵詢醫護人員意見，包括安排樣本化驗以排除其他傳染病感染的可能。

衞生署會繼續留意事件的發展和採取適當的跟進。"

  All passing-out officers adopted the Chinese-style foot drill to form the patterns of the ""sword and key"" of the Customs crest, the characters representing the National 15th Five-Year Plan, and a pattern of a horse, symbolising that Hong Kong Customs will fully support the HKSAR Government in proactively aligning with the National 15th Five-Year Plan, and integrating into and contributing to the overall national development. The patterns also served as wishes of every success and prosperity for the country and Hong Kong, as well as good health for all guests in the Year of the Horse.

  Speaking at the passing-out parade, Mr Chan said Hong Kong Customs' role has evolved from a traditional law enforcement agency into a multifaceted trade facilitator and economic development promoter to enable Hong Kong to better align with the country's development, and fulfil its role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"".

  He added that Customs has undertaken numerous new enforcement duties and introduced various innovative trade facilitation measures. The successful implementation of these initiatives is a testament to officers' collective effort and people-oriented professionalism. He expressed his hope that the passing-out officers will carry on this fine tradition and outshine their predecessors.

  Lastly, Mr Chan encouraged the passing-out officers to continue learning, embrace changes, be innovative, and stay curious. They should also have the courage to step out of their comfort zone. In addition, he encouraged the passing-out officers to exercise probity and prudence in exercising authority, and inherit and promote the excellent legacy of integrity of Customs."

Speech by FS at Inaugural Francis Chan Lecture 2025 (English only)(with photos),2026-02-06 21:13,2026-02-06 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600753.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Inaugural Francis Chan Lecture 2025 today (February 6):

Francis (Choh-Ming Li Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Professor Francis Chan), Philip (Dean of Faculty of Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Professor Philip Chiu), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you very much for the kind invitation. It is an honour to be here among so many distinguished leaders from the business sector, academia, and the wider community.

This lecture series is a fitting tribute to Professor Francis Chan, whose visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to excellence at CU Medicine have shaped not only the Faculty for more than a decade, but also the broader development of healthcare and medical education in Hong Kong.

Tonight I have been invited to speak on the trends, the challenges and the outlook for the coming years. Indeed, we are living through an era of great changes unseen in a century, or百年變局 as commonly referred to in Chinese. Here, I would like to share some reflections on what we have been experiencing globally, how our country is rising to this moment, and what this unfolding chapter means for Hong Kong.

My standpoint is clear: the world is becoming more unpredictable and challenging, but we can be confident about our country's and Hong Kong's future.

Great changes unseen in a century

Former Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank, Professor Lin Yifu, has advanced an economic perspective on ""great changes unseen in a century"". For a century or so, a small group of eight advanced economies sat at the apex of the global economic order. Together, they accounted for close to half of the world's GDP in purchasing power parity terms (PPP). Since 2000, however, their share has been declining, and now stands at around 35 per cent. This shift reflects the rapid growth of the Global South, which now accounts for about 60 per cent of the world's GDP in PPP terms. China already overtook the US in 2014 to become the world's largest economy by PPP.

China's achievements over the past decade were indeed spectacular, and they span multiple dimensions: in poverty alleviation, in industrial production, in innovation and technology, in green transition, in military capabilities and many other areas.

In 2012, two eminent economists, later Nobel laureates, wrote a book called ""Why Nations Fail"", attempting to make prophetic predictions about China. They said China's growth ""will not last"" because its so-called ""extractive"" institutions would ultimately choke off innovation and higher incomes.

More than 13 years on, our country has not become extractive. Rather, it has placed growing emphasis on inclusive development, with technology and innovation as a core driver of growth. The results are clear. China is now home to more than 400 unicorns, nearly one-third of the world's total. This dynamism and technological prowess were vividly illustrated by the ""DeepSeek Moment"" last year.

At a time when advanced economies are facing mounting governance challenges, the structural change of economic weight is prompting people to ask if the Western models of development offer a universally applicable blueprint for good governance.

These points above are helpful in understanding the global geo-economic landscape. US unilateralism and its hegemonic reflexes are, of course, objectionable. But much of it can also be seen as resisting the changing order. Many commentators note that Washington's sweeping tariffs seek to raise revenue, helping to finance an increasingly unsustainable debt burden. Others say the US is tightening its grip on the Western Hemisphere, as part of its effort to counter its principal strategic competitor: China.

This development has profound ramifications. We are hearing growing calls for greater European independence, and for middle powers to work together. My view is that the international community now recognises that great power politics is here to stay, and that countries must build strategic resilience by diversifying their economic and even security partnerships.

In the foreseeable future, we will likely see more regionalised patterns of co-operation, with three major blocs taking shape: first, China together with Southeast Asia; second, the Americas; and third, Europe together with the Middle East and possibly India. Some may say this is ""de globalisation"", but it is more a reconfiguration of globalisation than its reversal. Some call this ""re-globalisation"".

Beyond geo-economics, another driver of change is the new wave of technological innovation powered by artificial intelligence.

AI is permeating every industry and sector, giving rise to the term ""AI+"": AI plus manufacturing, AI plus finance, AI plus healthcare, AI plus public services, and much more.

There is no doubt that AI has become a key arena of great power competition, and that competition is intense. It is not only a race to build better models and more advanced chips, but also a broader contest for capital, energy, talent, application, and the capacity to build competitive innovation ecosystems. It is also a matter of national security.

The third major trend is the global push for green transition. The devastating impacts of climate change need no further elaboration, but we are confronting two critical gaps. The first is a financing gap. Global estimates indicate a shortfall of US$4.4 trillion annually in the investment required to meet the targets set under the Paris Agreement. The second is a gap in political will. With the US withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time, serious questions arise about whether other economies will remain as committed, and whether the necessary global funding for climate action will materialise.

Yet there are also reasons for optimism, particularly in China. In the first three quarters of 2025, renewable energy accounted for approximately 40 per cent of total power generation on the Chinese Mainland. In approaching the ""3060"" carbon neutrality goals, China has established a dominant position in the ""new three industries"": electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells. Indeed, China is well positioned to take a leading role in driving the global green transition in the years ahead.

China's path of development

Ladies and gentlemen, I have taken some time to highlight some key global trends because they provide the context for understanding our country's development directions, which will be unveiled in the upcoming National 15th Five-Year Plan.

In the relevant recommendations released in October last year, our country has set out a target to raise GDP per capita to the level of a ""moderately developed country"" by 2035. This means that in the coming 10 years, China's real GDP needs to grow, on average, at around 4.2 per cent annually. Maintaining this trajectory requires continuous enhancements in productivity, upgrading of industry, and steady progress in innovation driven, high quality development.

How to achieve this is the key question. Three points are worth highlighting. First, there is a strong emphasis on boosting domestic consumption. China is already the world's second-largest consumer market. And with rising incomes, growing urbanisation and upgrading of spending structure, there is significant potential for consumption to become a powerful economic driver.

Second, expanding high-level two-way opening up. This exactly responds to the need for diversification of the country's economic relationships to strength its strategic resilience. On the one hand, more Mainland enterprises are encouraged to go global, as supply and industry chains are being reconfigured. On the other hand, China has made it clear that it welcomes high-quality foreign goods and services besides investment into its domestic market. This also rightly addresses international concerns about China's trade surplus, signalling that the country is willing and able to import more and share the benefits of its growth with the world.

Third, there is a strong push for high-level scientific and technological self-reliance. One point is particularly noteworthy. The country will focus on building a modern industrial system in which technological innovation is deeply integrated with industrial development. In the years to come, we can expect many more game-changing breakthroughs from China in cutting-edge fields such as AI, quantum computing, semiconductor, biotech, communications and new energy. We will see solid progress in overcoming critical ""chokepoints"" that have constrained the country's technological advancement in the past.

Hong Kong, going forward

Ladies and gentlemen, all these bring me to the final part of my remarks: where will Hong Kong stand?

Two key principles will be pivotal for Hong Kong going forward. First, we must integrate with and actively contribute to the country's overall development, while leveraging these opportunities to advance our own growth and enhance our competitiveness. Second, we must make full use of our unique strengths under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement and, in the years ahead, do all we can to support the implementation of the upcoming 15th National Five-Year Plan.

In the interest of time, I would highlight just three specific areas where we can make valuable contributions: finance, talent and international connectivity.

In the process of building China into a strong nation, a strong international financial centre is essential. And Hong Kong is playing precisely that role. Our financial sector has all the leading global financial institutions and players. Our stock market serves as a key platform for Mainland companies to raise capital to support their expansion globally. Last year, Hong Kong ranked first in the world for IPO fundraising, with over HK$280 billion raised. Today, more than 400 companies are in the pipeline waiting to be listed.

Indeed, many companies seeking to raise funds in Hong Kong are tech start-ups engaged in frontier technologies. Over the years, we have revamped our listing regime for new economy companies to list here. And that is supported by a vibrant private equity and venture capital ecosystem, second in Asia only after the Mainland. Meanwhile, with the efforts of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, we are also channelling patient capital to frontier technology sectors. In other words, Hong Kong is providing a full spectrum of funding options that serve the needs of tech enterprises at various stages of development.

That said, we also see tremendous potential to further develop our capital market to make it more comprehensive and competitive.

One segment is the fixed income and currency market, or the FIC market, such as bonds, fixed income ETFs, and other debt securities. Another key pillar of our vision is to expand Hong Kong's offshore Renminbi (RMB) market. This will not only increase the liquidity of our market but can also support the prudent internationalisation of the RMB. We will continue to broaden the range of RMB-denominated investment and risk management products, improve offshore RMB liquidity, and strengthen the supporting market infrastructure.

For example, we are also working to develop a globally competitive, multi-asset class clearing and custodial infrastructure that spans both equities and debt securities in multiple currencies. This will enable cross-collateralisation of assets to enhance liquidity and support the development of a new suite of derivatives and other financial products.

Another segment with high potential, but not without controversy, is digital assets. At its core, the vision is for Hong Kong to serve as a testing ground for financial innovation, leveraging the unique advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" framework. We are advancing this development prudently, by striking the right balance between innovation and risk, embracing new technologies while safeguarding investors, consumers and financial security. 

The second area where Hong Kong can make a meaningful contribution is talent development. The Central Government has positioned Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent, and we are advancing this goal through a two-pronged approach. First, we are supporting our world-class academic and research institutions in nurturing top-tier talent. A recent initiative is the Northern Metropolis University Town, with the vision of fostering deep integration between education, research and industrial development. A working group chaired by the Chief Secretary is currently examining the suitable development models.

The second prong is attracting global talent. Over the past three years, our various talent admission schemes have received nearly 580 000 applications, of which 400 000 have been approved, and around 266 000 individuals have already arrived in Hong Kong. In today's shifting geopolitical landscape, many ethnic Chinese scientists and engineers are more willing to pursue their careers in Hong Kong. On this, we have also launched a HK$3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme to help local publicly funded universities bring in more world-renowned academic and researchers in cutting-edge fields.

The third area to make the best use of our unique strength under ""one country, two systems"" is international connectivity. Beyond supporting Mainland enterprises to ""go global"", Hong Kong also serves as an ideal showcase and validation platform, helping Chinese product standards and practices gain broader international recognition. We are already contributing to international rule making and standard setting in areas such as financial regulation, green and sustainable finance, construction services and dispute resolution. But we can—and should—do more. Our professionals' and businesses' deep understanding of both Chinese and global systems gives us a distinct and valuable advantage.

But beyond business, we need to enhance our participation in multilateral institutions and contribute to the evolving architecture of global governance.

One prominent example is the recent establishment in Hong Kong of the headquarters of the International Organization for Mediation, an intergovernmental body dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation.

In a rapidly changing world, we are well positioned to enhance the voice and influence in the international community of not just our country, but this region and the broader Global South.

Closing remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, as the saying goes, ""Fortune favours the brave."" The world is changing in ways that are complex and, at times, unpredictable. Yet our country's development in the coming five years presents enormous opportunities. And Hong Kong's openness, connectivity and resilience remain our enduring strength, and the compass in navigating this era of transformation.

With agility, perseverance and a clear sense of purpose, we are ready to rise to the challenges, embrace the opportunities, and play a defining role in shaping a brighter future for our city and contribute to the development of our country. For that, I'm highly confident.

Thank you once again for the kind invitation. I wish you a most enjoyable evening. In just a couple of weeks, we will welcome the Year of the Horse. May it bring you and your loved ones good health, great success and boundless energy in all your pursuits. Thank you very much."
Speech by FS at Inaugural Francis Chan Lecture 2025 (English only),2026-02-06 21:13,2026-02-06 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600753.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Inaugural Francis Chan Lecture 2025 today (February 6):

Francis (Choh-Ming Li Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics, Faculty of Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Professor Francis Chan), Philip (Dean of Faculty of Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Professor Philip Chiu), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you very much for the kind invitation. It is an honour to be here among so many distinguished leaders from the business sector, academia, and the wider community.

This lecture series is a fitting tribute to Professor Francis Chan, whose visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to excellence at CU Medicine have shaped not only the Faculty for more than a decade, but also the broader development of healthcare and medical education in Hong Kong.

Tonight I have been invited to speak on the trends, the challenges and the outlook for the coming years. Indeed, we are living through an era of great changes unseen in a century, or百年變局 as commonly referred to in Chinese. Here, I would like to share some reflections on what we have been experiencing globally, how our country is rising to this moment, and what this unfolding chapter means for Hong Kong.

My standpoint is clear: the world is becoming more unpredictable and challenging, but we can be confident about our country's and Hong Kong's future.

Great changes unseen in a century

Former Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank, Professor Lin Yifu, has advanced an economic perspective on ""great changes unseen in a century"". For a century or so, a small group of eight advanced economies sat at the apex of the global economic order. Together, they accounted for close to half of the world's GDP in purchasing power parity terms (PPP). Since 2000, however, their share has been declining, and now stands at around 35 per cent. This shift reflects the rapid growth of the Global South, which now accounts for about 60 per cent of the world's GDP in PPP terms. China already overtook the US in 2014 to become the world's largest economy by PPP.

China's achievements over the past decade were indeed spectacular, and they span multiple dimensions: in poverty alleviation, in industrial production, in innovation and technology, in green transition, in military capabilities and many other areas.

In 2012, two eminent economists, later Nobel laureates, wrote a book called ""Why Nations Fail"", attempting to make prophetic predictions about China. They said China's growth ""will not last"" because its so-called ""extractive"" institutions would ultimately choke off innovation and higher incomes.

More than 13 years on, our country has not become extractive. Rather, it has placed growing emphasis on inclusive development, with technology and innovation as a core driver of growth. The results are clear. China is now home to more than 400 unicorns, nearly one-third of the world's total. This dynamism and technological prowess were vividly illustrated by the ""DeepSeek Moment"" last year.

At a time when advanced economies are facing mounting governance challenges, the structural change of economic weight is promoting people to ask if the Western models of development offer a universally applicable blueprint for good governance.

These points above are helpful in understanding the global geo-economic landscape. US unilateralism and its hegemonic reflexes are, of course, objectionable. But much of it can also be seen as resisting the changing order. Many commentators note that Washington's sweeping tariffs seek to raise revenue, helping to finance an increasingly unsustainable debt burden. Others say the US is tightening its grip on the Western Hemisphere, as part of its effort to counter its principal strategic competitor: China.

This development has profound ramifications. We are hearing growing calls for greater European independence, and for middle powers to work together. My view is that the international community now recognises that great power politics is here to stay, and that countries must build strategic resilience by diversifying their economic and even security partnerships.

In the foreseeable future, we will likely see more regionalised patterns of co-operation, with three major blocs taking shape: first, China together with Southeast Asia; second, the Americas; and third, Europe together with the Middle East and possibly India. Some may say this is ""de globalisation"", but it is more a reconfiguration of globalisation than its reversal. Some call this ""re-globalisation"".

Beyond geo-economics, another driver of change is the new wave of technological innovation powered by artificial intelligence.

AI is permeating every industry and sector, giving rise to the term ""AI+"": AI plus manufacturing, AI plus finance, AI plus healthcare, AI plus public services, and much more.

There is no doubt that AI has become a key arena of great power competition, and that competition is intense. It is not only a race to build better models and more advanced chips, but also a broader contest for capital, energy, talent, application, and the capacity to build competitive innovation ecosystems. It is also a matter of national security.

The third major trend is the global push for green transition. The devastating impacts of climate change need no further elaboration, but we are confronting two critical gaps. The first is a financing gap. Global estimates indicate a shortfall of US$4.4 trillion annually in the investment required to meet the targets set under the Paris Agreement. The second is a gap in political will. With the US withdrawing from the Paris Agreement for the second time, serious questions arise about whether other economies will remain as committed, and whether the necessary global funding for climate action will materialise.

Yet there are also reasons for optimism, particularly in China. In the first three quarters of 2025, renewable energy accounted for approximately 40 per cent of total power generation on the Chinese Mainland. In approaching the ""3060"" carbon neutrality goals, China has established a dominant position in the ""new three industries"": electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells. Indeed, China is well positioned to take a leading role in driving the global green transition in the years ahead.

China's path of development

Ladies and gentlemen, I have taken some time to highlight some key global trends because they provide the context for understanding our country's development directions, which will be unveiled in the upcoming National 15th Five-Year Plan.

In the relevant recommendations released in October last year, our country has set out a target to raise GDP per capita to the level of a ""moderately developed country"" by 2035. This means that in the coming 10 years, China's real GDP needs to grow, on average, at around 4.2 per cent annually. Maintaining this trajectory requires continuous enhancements in productivity, upgrading of industry, and steady progress in innovation driven, high quality development.

How to achieve this is the key question. Three points are worth highlighting. First, there is a strong emphasis on boosting domestic consumption. China is already the world's second-largest consumer market. And with rising incomes, growing urbanisation and upgrading of spending structure, there is significant potential for consumption to become a powerful economic driver.

Second, expanding high-level two-way opening up. This exactly responds to the need for diversification of the country's economic relationships to strength its strategic resilience. On the one hand, more Mainland enterprises are encouraged to go global, as supply and industry chains are being reconfigured. On the other hand, China has made it clear that it welcomes high-quality foreign goods and services besides investment into its domestic market. This also rightly addresses international concerns about China's trade surplus, signalling that the country is willing and able to import more and share the benefits of its growth with the world.

Third, there is a strong push for high-level scientific and technological self-reliance. One point is particularly noteworthy. The country will focus on building a modern industrial system in which technological innovation is deeply integrated with industrial development. In the years to come, we can expect many more game-changing breakthroughs from China in cutting-edge fields such as AI, quantum computing, semiconductor, biotech, communications and new energy. We will see solid progress in overcoming critical ""chokepoints"" that have constrained the country's technological advancement in the past.

Hong Kong, going forward

Ladies and gentlemen, all these bring me to the final part of my remarks: where will Hong Kong stand?

Two key principles will be pivotal for Hong Kong going forward. First, we must integrate with and actively contribute to the country's overall development, while leveraging these opportunities to advance our own growth and enhance our competitiveness. Second, we must make full use of our unique strengths under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement and, in the years ahead, do all we can to support the implementation of the upcoming 15th National Five-Year Plan.

In the interest of time, I would highlight just three specific areas where we can make valuable contributions: finance, talent and international connectivity.

In the process of building China into a strong nation, a strong international financial centre is essential. And Hong Kong is playing precisely that role. Our financial sector has all the leading global financial institutions and players. Our stock market serves as a key platform for Mainland companies to raise capital to support their expansion globally. Last year, Hong Kong ranked first in the world for IPO fundraising, with over HK$280 billion raised. Today, more than 400 companies are in the pipeline waiting to be listed.

Indeed, many companies seeking to raise funds in Hong Kong are tech start-ups engaged in frontier technologies. Over the years, we have revamped our listing regime for new economy companies to list here. And that is supported by a vibrant private equity and venture capital ecosystem, second in Asia only after the Mainland. Meanwhile, with the efforts of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, we are also channelling patient capital to frontier technology sectors. In other words, Hong Kong is providing a full spectrum of funding options that serve the needs of tech enterprises at various stages of development.

That said, we also see tremendous potential to further develop our capital market to make it more comprehensive and competitive.

One segment is the fixed income and currency market, or the FIC market, such as bonds, fixed income ETFs, and other debt securities. Another key pillar of our vision is to expand Hong Kong's offshore Renminbi (RMB) market. This will not only increase the liquidity of our market but can also support the prudent internationalisation of the RMB. We will continue to broaden the range of RMB-denominated investment and risk management products, improve offshore RMB liquidity, and strengthen the supporting market infrastructure.

For example, we are also working to develop a globally competitive, multi-asset class clearing and custodial infrastructure that spans both equities and debt securities in multiple currencies. This will enable cross-collateralisation of assets to enhance liquidity and support the development of a new suite of derivatives and other financial products.

Another segment with high potential, but not without controversy, is digital assets. At its core, the vision is for Hong Kong to serve as a testing ground for financial innovation, leveraging the unique advantages of the ""one country, two systems"" framework. We are advancing this development prudently, by striking the right balance between innovation and risk, embracing new technologies while safeguarding investors, consumers and financial security. 

The second area where Hong Kong can make a meaningful contribution is talent development. The Central Government has positioned Hong Kong as an international hub for high-calibre talent, and we are advancing this goal through a two-pronged approach. First, we are supporting our world-class academic and research institutions in nurturing top-tier talent. A recent initiative is the Northern Metropolis University Town, with the vision of fostering deep integration between education, research and industrial development. A working group chaired by the Chief Secretary is currently examining the suitable development models.

The second prong is attracting global talent. Over the past three years, our various talent admission schemes have received nearly 580 000 applications, of which 400 000 have been approved, and around 266 000 individuals have already arrived in Hong Kong. In today's shifting geopolitical landscape, many ethnic Chinese scientists and engineers are more willing to pursue their careers in Hong Kong. On this, we have also launched a HK$3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme to help local publicly funded universities bring in more world-renowned academic and researchers in cutting-edge fields.

The third area to make the best use of our unique strength under ""one country, two systems"" is international connectivity. Beyond supporting Mainland enterprises to ""go global"", Hong Kong also serves as an ideal showcase and validation platform, helping Chinese product standards and practices gain broader international recognition. We are already contributing to international rule making and standard setting in areas such as financial regulation, green and sustainable finance, construction services and dispute resolution. But we can—and should—do more. Our professionals' and businesses' deep understanding of both Chinese and global systems gives us a distinct and valuable advantage.

But beyond business, we need to enhance our participation in multilateral institutions and contribute to the evolving architecture of global governance.

One prominent example is the recent establishment in Hong Kong of the headquarters of the International Organization for Mediation, an intergovernmental body dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation.

In a rapidly changing world, we are well positioned to enhance the voice and influence in the international community of not just our country, but this region and the broader Global South.

Closing remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, as the saying goes, ""Fortune favours the brave."" The world is changing in ways that are complex and, at times, unpredictable. Yet our country's development in the coming five years presents enormous opportunities. And Hong Kong's openness, connectivity and resilience remain our enduring strength, and the compass in navigating this era of transformation.

With agility, perseverance and a clear sense of purpose, we are ready to rise to the challenges, embrace the opportunities, and play a defining role in shaping a brighter future for our city and contribute to the development of our country. For that, I'm highly confident.

運輸及物流局局長在《運輸策略藍圖》記者會上回應有關安全帶法例的談話內容（附短片）,2026-02-06 20:58,2026-02-06 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600691.htm,"​以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（二月六日）在《運輸策略藍圖》記者會上回應有關安全帶法例的談話內容：

運輸及物流局局長：我知道大家在過去數天也對安全帶表示關注，在此讓我向大家說數句。首先，由於《道路交通（安全裝備）規例》（第374F章）中的第8D條和立法原意有落差，我們已於今天刊憲，刪除有關條文，亦對其他相關的條文作出相應修訂，目的是釐清情況，就是由即日起，將不會有乘坐專營巴士或非專營巴士時乘客必須佩戴安全帶的法定要求。

在這次事件中，我們在過去數天已全面檢視運輸及物流局的工作流程，相關組別的人員在推行措施的過程中未能察覺法律條文的不足，而在解說時部分亦不夠完全精準，令條文出現不同理解。

我認為我們現時必須就此事作出檢視，亦必須在局內強化內部覆核機制，並會進一步提高同事的警覺性，尤其在立法工作中，我們亦必須加強與各相關部門的溝通，不容許同類事件再次發生。

我想重申，我們的出發點是希望透過佩戴安全帶更好保障乘客安全。我相信社會上有不少聲音認為佩戴安全帶有助保障乘客安全，安全帶又可發揮功用，但希望實施及推行時既能保障乘客安全，又可了解市民、乘客的心聲及需求，而不會為他們帶來太大的不方便。行政長官已指示我要做好推動這方面的工作，在實施範圍和減少不便等多方面取得平衡。因此我們會重新全面檢討，包括從以下方向去做好這件事：

（一）運輸及物流局會全面檢視乘坐巴士時佩戴安全帶的安排，並展開公眾諮詢，廣納民意再就推行方向及細節提出建議；
（二）邀請專家就巴士上安全帶的設計、裝置和效能進行研究；及
（三）繼續加強宣傳教育，培養公眾自發佩戴安全帶的習慣。

我會帶領運輸及物流局的同事，以最嚴謹和開放的態度，把政策做好，考慮和平衡各方面因素，做到既可保障乘客安全，又減少所帶來的不方便，讓公眾有空間討論，從而在社會建立共識，以提出惠民、便民的方案。我們亦希望與立法會繼續討論，以達致最有效又平衡的可行方案。多謝大家。

記者：局長你好。現時社會上很多人對巴士安全帶有不同聲音和意見，政府今日亦刊憲刪除必須佩戴安全帶的條文，想問政府之後會否打算繼續推行？如會，會如何作出優化？期望何時再推？

運輸及物流局局長：多謝你的提問。我們今日已經安排刊憲，修訂有關條文予以刪除，所以在法律及執法上，我們釐清了狀況。在推行安全帶的工作方面，我們在這段時間了解到，社會對於執行在巴士上佩戴安全帶的規定，表達了很多不同意見和建議。我們未來將有關意見歸納、統整，也會小心審視每個意見，從而集思廣益。

我們初步看到有幾個方向。有人提到，是否可以按照巴士上不同座位的情況或安全風險，評估佩戴安全帶的規定，例如巴士上層或下層是否可以有不同處理？亦有人提及罰則會否過高？有沒有調整空間？有市民反映，現時巴士上安裝的安全帶的裝置是三點式設計，保障當然比較完善、全面，但在舒適度、使用程度方面，又可能未必那麼好。我們可否探討不同的安全帶設計，如兩點式安全帶？我們接下來很快——其實我們也一直同步在做——會將這些意見歸納、統整出不同方向。

除了現時收到的意見之外，運輸及物流局將會展開公眾諮詢，我們要全面聽取在社會上，包括巴士乘客的意見、建議和關注，從而更能分析不同可行方案、選項、優化空間，再行與立法會討論及介紹，這將會是我們的基礎，將這件事繼續推進。而同時，因為佩戴安全帶在保障乘客安全的確發揮到作用，我們本着我們的出發點，就是盡量能夠保障市民在乘坐巴士時候的安全，所以我們與巴士公司、營辦商及相關委員會，會同步展開加強宣傳教育的工作。我們希望在這個時候，能夠培養公眾自覺佩戴安全帶的習慣，讓社會對此事更有認識、認知，亦讓大家適應。在這段時間，我們一定會廣納民意，以及持開放態度，但我們都會積極、正面、具團隊精神地去推進這件事。

記者：你指會重新諮詢，是否有諮詢時間表？另外，你指已檢視相關流程，相關人員不了解條文不足、解說亦不足，這涉及哪個層級人員？有關人員是否需要問責？第三，局長會否趁此機會向市民致歉？

運輸及物流局局長：我們會盡快開始重新檢視，目前我們聽到很多意見，會把它們歸納及統整。當然，我們希望能一直積極盡快進行，現階段我不會就此特別預設一個硬性時間表，但我希望在未來數個月能歸納意見，初步提出優化空間、方案及選項作公眾諮詢，亦可給予足夠時間聽取市民意見。

另一方面，我們已就此事作出檢視，相關組別的同事在籌備及推展的整體過程中，在不同環節上均未能及時察覺條文不足，在解說時可能用字亦未必完全精準。在提高同事警覺性方面，除了在文化上要加強外，最重要是持續強化內部覆核、審核機制，其實過去我們也有做。我認為尤其同事現時的工作量繁重，既要推展政策，同時要處理很多大小不同的法例。不過無論如何，涉及法例的修改屬大事，尤其牽涉民生議題，警覺性應要特別高、察覺性亦要特別大。因此，我們會強內部的覆核機制，亦希望可繼續落實我們經常提及的「紅隊」檢視制度及文化，我們會朝着這個方向提供更多這方面的系統化提升，亦有助支援同事。至於相關組別同事在處理這事時，工作表現可能未能發揮最好，我們在內部一向有工作表現管理機制，會按機制處理及跟進。總的來說，我們是一個團隊、一條心。我作為局長，對局內的工作一定有責任，而我未來最重要的責任是帶領團隊，做好我剛才所說重新檢視有關佩戴安全帶方面的工作，希望能建立市民廣泛共識，多聽意見，在可行、有效、平衡、便利的基礎上尋求最佳及有效的方案。這是我們當前最想做到的目標，亦是我們最大的責任。多謝。

記者：安全帶條例原文是否有錯？政府有否做錯？

運輸及物流局局長：我多答一條問題，其實我也盡量回應大家。我們現時會很小心謹慎，亦會以很嚴謹的態度審視整體在巴士上乘客佩戴安全帶的安排。現時正好讓我們把不同意見統整，進行公眾諮詢，亦希望加強內部覆核機制，從而支援同事，讓同事在繁忙的工作中能有效地做好工作，包括在籌備、推展及確立法例推進工作時符合政策目標。我作為局長，對我或我整個團隊而言，也很認真反思及在不同方面汲取很好的教訓。接下來，我們更會秉持謙卑、嚴謹態度把這事做好，務求令好的政策可以以人為本的方式推行。希望大家可在這方面給予我們很好的支持，以及營造很好的氛圍，讓我們與巴士乘客及營辦商共同培養佩戴安全帶的安全意識，同時可就未來路向找出最佳的平衡點，作出最優化、有效的安排。多謝大家。

Remarks by STL on law on seat belts at press conference on Transport Strategy Blueprint (with video),2026-02-06 20:58,2026-02-06 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600706.htm,"​Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, on the law of seat belts at the press conference on Transport Strategy Blueprint today (February 6):

Reporter: By taking responsibility of the team, do you mean you are trying to apologise to the public on behalf of the team? Also, could you detail a bit in English—what do you mean by that you try to improve the communication between officials to further explain and better clarify the regulation to the public?

Secretary for Transport and Logistics: The objective of introducing the relevant subsidiary legislation on seat belt installation and wearing actually revolves our primary objective: to enhance passenger safety provision. We remain positive and we remain our view that we have to do everything at our best in order to enhance passenger safety in different aspects. At the present moment, we have received, collected and gathered different views, suggestions and concerns regarding the wearing of seat belts on buses, including franchised buses and non-franchised buses.

These views received so far can be classified into different areas. They are related to the design, the installation of seatbelts, the scope of applicability of seatbelt installation and wearing within a bus, as well as exemptions or the penalties. All these feedback or views will be classified and consolidated into various buckets.

At the same time, we are gearing up ourselves as soon as possible to consolidate these views, and to summarise them into different areas, so as to enable the Transport and Logistics Bureau to conduct a public consultation exercise, so that we can collect and gather more views in different aspects in a systematic way. We hope that, with public consultation and views collected, this will enable us to explore actively or examine different feasible options, including possible areas to further enhance the arrangement for installation and wearing of seatbelts by passengers on buses.

We also attach importance to the internal verification, monitoring and double-checking system safeguard arrangement. My team and I, of course, consider that we must be more careful and serious in examining and in taking forward important legislative exercises such as this seat belt legislation, so that we can make sure that, in future legislative exercises, we can be foolproof in our preparation and ensuring that the policy and legislative intent are fully reflected in the legislation, as well as to ensure that our explanation and various briefings made are consistent with the objective we would like to deliver. Thank you very much.

  The Regulation aims to repeal the provision added by the Road Traffic (Safety Equipment) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 to the Road Traffic (Safety Equipment) Regulations (Chapter 374F)relating to the requirement for passengers to wear seat belts on buses (i.e. regulation 8D), and makes consequential amendments. Upon repealing and amending the relevant provisions, there is no longer any statutory requirement for passengers to wear seat belts on franchised or non-franchised buses.

  The statutory requirement for the wearing of seat belts on other types of vehicles (including private cars, taxis, goods vehicles, light buses, special purpose vehicles, student service vehicles) other than franchised and non-franchised buses remains in effect. When the non-franchised buses are used for student services, passengers must wear seat belts in accordance with Regulation 8G of the Road Traffic (Safety Equipment) Regulations (Chapter 374F).

  Going forward, the Government will undertake a fresh review of the arrangements for wearing seat belts on buses and initiate a public consultation to solicit broad input from the community. Concurrently, we will engage subject matter experts to examine issues relating to design, installation and effectiveness of seat belt arrangements, and formulate recommendations on the directions and details of implementation. Meanwhile, we will continue to enhance publicity and education efforts to encourage the voluntary wearing of seat belts on buses.

  Relevant information is featured in the Legislative Council Brief issued by the Government today."
Government announces Transport Strategy Blueprint (with photos/video),2026-02-06 20:03,2026-02-06 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600696.htm,"​The Government announced the Transport Strategy Blueprint today (February 6), with the vision of ""Implementing a people-centric approach, Strengthening connectivity with both the Mainland and the world, Promoting efficient travel, and Embracing green lifestyle"". It establishes three major themes for future transport development, and proposes six strategies with a total of 25 recommendations to drive the sustainable development of Hong Kong's transport system.

The three major themes are ""Enjoyable Journeys"", ""Well-connected City"", and ""Healthy Mobility"". ""Enjoyable Journeys"" adheres to a public transport-oriented policy, enhancing local and cross-boundary transport infrastructure to connect the economic core areas of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, driving economic development and optimising passenger travel experiences. ""Well-connected City"" focuses on leveraging advanced technology to promote digitalised traffic management, improving transport efficiency, including more flexible scheduling of public transport services based on individual passenger needs, promoting autonomous driving, and sharing more transport data with the public for trip planning, fostering smart mobility. ""Healthy Mobility"" integrates the concept of sustainable communities into urban planning, actively promoting green travel modes such as walking, cycling, and electric mobility devices.

  The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, said, ""Transportation is a cornerstone of modern urban development, shaping economic growth, regional integration, and the daily lives of citizens. The Blueprint sets out future objectives, strategies, and directions, articulating short-, medium-, and long-term measures to advance Hong Kong's economic development and enhance the convenience for its people. This year, we have ten key measures, and the Blueprint also outlines transport strategies for the next two decades, allowing us to maintain our global leadership in public transport, consolidating Hong Kong's position as a regional and national transportation hub; at the same time, through actively embracing smart technology, providing more convenient and diverse transportation options for citizens and tourists, making Hong Kong a city ideal for living, working and travelling.

The Blueprint comprehensively considers Hong Kong's population trends, travel demands, urban and technological development, and other factors. Key contents include a new layout of ""Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal"" infrastructure projects, planning for a new generation of Transport Interchange Hubs, flexible ""Smart Demand-responsive Public Transport Mode"" services, enhancing the application of artificial intelligence in traffic management, promoting the development of autonomous vehicles, actively increasing parking spaces, developing low-altitude economy, and enhancing pedestrian environments. The implementation of the Blueprint will promote Hong Kong's economic growth and sustainable development, while facilitating the movement of people and goods within the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area.

The full text of the Blueprint has been uploaded to the Transport and Logistics Bureau website (www.tlb.gov.hk)."
Home and Youth Affairs Bureau holds first training session in 2026 for members of District Councils (with photo),2026-02-06 19:28,2026-02-06 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600675.htm,"​The Home and Youth Affairs Bureau (HYAB) held the first training session for members of the District Councils (DC) in 2026 at the Central Government Offices today (February 6). The training covered the Government's support and response work after the Wang Fuk Court fire in Tai Po. It aimed to provide guidance to the DC members on how to respond to and help affected residents in the event of a major disaster, as well as enhancing the collaboration with District Committee members and Care Teams, thereby giving full play to the functions of the ""troika"" in district governance. DC members were also requested to assist in improving the efficacy of building management in their daily work in order to prevent the reoccurrence of similar incidents.

The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, shared the Government's handling of the fire, in particular areas under the purview of the HYAB team. These included immediately opening community halls as temporary shelters, mobilising Care Teams to assist residents, helping with the receipt and distribution of supplies and the disbursement of emergency subsidies, establishing the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po to render assistance to residents of Wang Fuk Court and support various related initiatives, and co-ordinating with operators of hotels and youth hostels/camps to provide emergency short-term accommodation for the residents. The Government also invoked for the first time section 31 of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) (BMO) to apply for dissolution of the then management committee of the owners' corporation (OC) of Wang Fuk Court, and appointment of an administrator to assist in clarifying the legal liabilities and entitlements of the OC and the owners, and examining the accounts of the OC. 

Miss Mak said that under the leadership of the Chief Executive, the Government was pressing ahead with improvement measures on various fronts and implementing systemic reforms to break down barriers of vested interests. The HYAB and the Home Affairs Department are conducting a comprehensive review of the BMO following five preliminary amendment directions. The HYAB will consult the property management sector, OCs and owners on proposals for further amendments to the BMO, and will also collect views at district level through the Working Group on Building Management (WGBM) of DCs to take forward the subsequent legislative amendment exercise.

Miss Mak told DC members that the incident had highlighted the advantages of the executive-led system after improving district governance, where districts could effectively mobilise the ""troika"" and the HYAB had greatly enhanced its capability to take actions. The Wang Fuk Court fire had heightened concerns among different sectors of the community and the general public about building management and safety in repair work. Miss Mak reminded DC members that, at the frontline of district governance, they should proactively assist owners and residents in need in handling matters relating to building management, and make good use of the WGBM of DCs to provide suggestions to the Government. Miss Mak encouraged DC members to enhance the communication and interactions with residents and listen to their imminent concerns, with a view to identifying, intervening and resolving problems faced by the people at an early stage. She also expected that DC members would work together with the Government to drive the post-fire reforms to build a safer Hong Kong.

The HYAB will continue to arrange different training sessions and visits to enhance the DC members' capabilities in discharging their duties and improve the efficacy of district governance to deliver tangible benefits for the people."
民政及青年事務局舉辦二○二六年第一次區議員培訓班（附圖）,2026-02-06 18:51,2026-02-06 18:59,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600652.htm,"​民政及青年事務局（民青局）今日（二月六日）在政府總部舉行二○二六年第一次區議員培訓班，內容主要涵蓋政府在大埔宏福苑大火後的支援及應對工作，讓區議員學習在大型災害事故中如何應變和幫助受影響的居民，以及加強與地區委員會和關愛隊的協作，發揮好地區治理「三駕馬車」的功能。同時，促請區議員在日常工作中協助提升大廈管理的效能，以防止同類事故再次發生。
​
民青局局長麥美娟分享政府對是次大火的處理工作，特別是民青團隊負責的範疇，包括即時開放社區會堂作為庇護中心，動員關愛隊到場協助居民，協助收發物資及發放應急錢；成立「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，協助居民及支持各項相關工作；以及協調多間酒店、青年宿舍／營舍的營運者，提供應急短期住宿予居民暫居。政府亦首次引用《建築物管理條例》（第344章）（《建管條例》）第31條，申請解散宏福苑法團原有的管理委員會，委任管理人協助釐清法團及業主的法律責任及權益，以及協助查明法團的帳目情況。

麥美娟表示，政府在行政長官的領導下，正推動各方面的改善措施，並落實系統性改革，打破利益藩籬。民青局及民政事務總署正全面檢討《建管條例》，初步擬定五大方面的修訂方向。民青局將就進一步修訂《建管條例》的有關建議諮詢物管業界、法團及業主，亦會透過區議會大廈管理工作小組廣泛收集地區意見，以展開後續的修例工作。

麥美娟向區議員表示，今次事故突顯了在完善地區治理後行政主導的優勢，地區有效動員「三駕馬車」，民青團隊的行動力亦大大提升。大埔宏福苑大火使社會各界及廣大市民對大廈管理及維修工程安全更為關心。麥美娟提醒區議員作為地區治理的前線，應積極主動協助有需要的業主和居民處理大廈管理相關事宜，亦要好好利用區議會的大廈管理工作小組向政府提出建議。麥美娟寄語區議員繼續加強與居民的溝通和接觸，親身聆聽居民的「急難愁盼」，做到早發現、早介入、早解決市民面對的問題。同時，她亦希望各位區議員能與政府共同推動大火後改革工作，建設更安全的香港。

民青局將繼續安排不同的培訓和考察活動，協助區議員更好履行職務，加強地區治理效能，務求讓市民切實受惠。"
政務司副司長出席「THE BRIDGE⁺ UOB ART ACADEMY」開幕典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2026-02-06 18:50,2026-02-06 18:59,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600308.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（二月六日）出席「THE BRIDGE⁺UOB ART ACADEMY」開幕典禮的致辭：

Ken（德天社會企業創辦人霍啟剛）、Alice（民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟）、Christine（大華銀行「藝‧坊」總監葉楊詩明）、張文喜總領事（新加坡駐香港總領事）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

  大家好！今天很高興出席「THE BRIDGE⁺ UOB ART ACADEMY」的開幕典禮，見證這個深具特色的藝術文化空間正式啓用。

首先，我感謝Ken帶領德天社會企業（德天）一直以來對推動社會共融及人文藝術發展不遺餘力。二○二三年，德天首個重點項目——「The Bridge⁺人文藝術空間」——落戶深水埗，兩年多來在該處舉辦的作品展覽一場接一場，成功打造了一個讓藝術走入日常、讓不同階層人士共融共賞的平台，進一步凝聚社區。時隔近三年，我樂見德天將這個理念延伸至油麻地上海街這幢百年唐樓之中，把藝術普及化及社區化的工作拓展到油尖旺區。

油尖旺區一向以多元文化見稱，建築物新舊雜陳；既是商業旅遊核心，亦是舊樓林立的基層社區，少數族裔人口比例更是全港之冠，處處展現多樣性與活力。

這幢「THE BRIDGE⁺ UOB ART ACADEMY」所在的百年歷史建築，正是坐落於如此獨特的社區脈絡之中。它不但見證了香港的城市發展與變遷，更承載了油尖旺一帶珍貴的集體回憶。德天選擇活化這幢建築，在延續歷史的同時亦賦予此建築全新的意義：不但是藝術展覽空間，同時亦是駐場藝術家的住宿。我期待未來通過在「THE BRIDGE⁺ UOB ART ACADEMY」舉辦的各類型展覽、工作坊及公眾活動，能夠進一步推動文化傳承、促進社區藝術發展。這個歷史空間融入中國傳統水墨藝術元素，正是文化與歷史交織、讓藝術走進社區的最佳示範。

油尖旺區集觀光、美食和歷史文化於一身，是旅客必到的地方。由我帶領的發展旅遊熱點工作組在港九地區發掘和建設匯聚人氣的旅遊熱點。首階段有九個具備香港特色的項目，其中位於油尖旺的舊油蔴地警署，已於今年一月一日正式開幕。

我們期望隨着「油蔴地警署光影之旅」開展，連同這幢富特色的歷史建築正式開幕，能夠相輔相成，帶旺油尖旺區，吸引更多人流到訪附近景點，包括上海街這裏一帶的廚具、佛具店鋪，豐富旅客體驗。

最後，我祝願「THE BRIDGE⁺UOB ART ACADEMY」人流興旺，今次展覽圓滿成功。新春將至，在此預祝各位萬事如意、馬到功成！多謝大家。"
反非法勞工行動拘五十六人（附圖）,2026-02-06 18:45,2026-02-06 18:59,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600645.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於一月三十日至昨日（二月五日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「曙光行動」、「促進行動」、「銀翼行動」、聯同勞工處執行的「彩虹行動」、聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」以及聯同民政事務總署及勞工處執行的聯合行動。行動中共拘捕四十三名懷疑非法勞工及十三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

在入境處聯同民政事務總署及勞工處的聯合行動中，入境處人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括位於油尖旺區內的賓館，共拘捕七名人士，包括六名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工人士。被捕的六名懷疑非法勞工包括兩男四女，年齡介乎二十九至五十一歲，其中三人為現職外傭，她們被捕時正在賓館從事房間清潔的工作。而因涉嫌聘用非法勞工人士為一名女子，年齡七十五歲，為涉案賓館的負責人。其餘三名被捕的懷疑非法勞工均為雜工，包括兩名持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）的男子及一名逾期逗留的前外傭。

於其他的反非法勞工行動中，調查人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括食肆、清潔公司及裝修單位等，共拘捕三十七名懷疑非法勞工及十二名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為三十五男兩女，年齡介乎二十六至五十六歲，當中一名男子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為九男三女，年齡介乎三十三至六十一歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。另外，輸入勞工獲准以僱傭身分來港後，必須按『標準僱傭合約』所訂明直接受僱於合約中指定的同一僱主，並擔任合約中指定的職位及在指定的地點工作，而且不可受僱於其他公司或次承判商，亦不可轉換僱主、職位或工作地點（『標準僱傭合約』訂明的工作地點除外）。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

56 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2026-02-06 18:45,2026-02-06 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600649.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Twilight"", ""Contribute"", ""Silverwing"", a joint operation with the Labour Department codenamed ""Rainbow"", joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"" and a joint operation with the Home Affairs Department and the Labour Department from January 30 to yesterday (February 5). A total of 43 suspected illegal workers and 13 suspected employers were arrested.

  In the joint operation with the Home Affairs Department and the Labour Department, Immd investigators raided multiple locations, including targeted guesthouses in Yau Tsim Mong District. Seven persons were arrested including six suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer. The arrested illegal workers comprised two men and four women, aged 29 to 51. Three of them were current foreign domestic helpers, who were found performing room cleaning duties in the guesthouses. A woman aged 75 was suspected of employing illegal workers and was the person-in-charge of the guesthouses. The remaining three illegal workers were illegal odd job workers including two men holding recognisance forms which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong and an overstayed former foreign domestic helper.

  During other anti-illegal worker operations, investigators raided multiple target locations including restaurants, cleaning companies and flats under renovation. Thirty-seven suspected illegal workers and 12 suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised 35 men and two women, aged 26 to 56. Among them, a man was holding recognisance form which prohibits him from taking any employment in Hong Kong. Nine men and three women, aged 33 to 61, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Moreover, after entry into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, an imported worker admitted on an employment condition must remain under the direct employment of the same employer for the specified job and in the specific workplace(s) as stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract and cannot be employed by other companies or subcontractors. Change of the employer, post or place of work (unless stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract) is not permitted. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or an identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

The Chairman of the Transport Advisory Committee (TAC), Professor Wong Sze-chun, welcomed the Transport and Logistics Bureau's promulgation of the Transport Strategy Blueprint (the Blueprint) today (February 6).

Professor Wong, said, ""The Blueprint proposes a series of forward-looking and concrete measures to realise the vision of 'Implementing a People-centric Approach, Strengthening Connectivity with Both the Mainland and the World, Promoting Efficient Travel, and Embracing a Green Lifestyle.' Its vision and recommendations are closely tied to people's livelihoods, economy and social development, laying a solid foundation for the sustainable development and efficient operation of Hong Kong's transportation system in the coming decades.

""I have noticed that the Blueprint incorporates suggestions from the TAC, including leveraging technology to enhance public transport services, stepping up efforts to advance the development of autonomous vehicles, building a low-carbon living circle, and advancing the '15-minute neighbourhood' planning concept, truly taking to heart the principles of convenience and benefit for the people.

""Technological development is unstoppable, and Hong Kong must move with the tide. I particularly admire the goals and measures in the Blueprint related to AI, digital traffic management, autonomous driving, and the low-altitude economy, which enable members of the public to utilise the most advanced technologies in Hong Kong's transportation system, making daily commuting safer and more convenient.

""The TAC will continue to provide advice and suggestions to the Government in line with the Blueprint's strategies, aiming for the efficient implementation of these measures. The TAC expects the Government to maintain Hong Kong's globally renowned transportation infrastructure and public transport services, consolidate the advantages of the transport and logistics industry, and build a more livable city while enhancing its status as an international shipping centre."""

蚊傳疾病登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況,2026-02-06 18:00,2026-02-06 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600592.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月六日）公布登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區（包括鄰近東南亞國家）的氣溫仍然適合蚊媒滋生，市民前往受蚊傳疾病影響的地區，應採取措施防止被蚊叮咬，包括穿着寬鬆、淺色的長袖上衣及長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。

登革熱
———

​由一月三十日至昨日（二月五日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期到過印度尼西亞。

截至昨日，今年錄得六宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。去年（二○二五年）錄得59宗登革熱個案，全部屬外地傳入。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。世衞在二○二四年錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。去年一月至七月，全球97個國家／地區亦呈報了超過400萬宗登革熱個案及超過3 000宗相關死亡個案。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點亦普遍流行，印度尼西亞、印度和越南去年分別錄得超過120 000宗個案，馬來西亞和泰國亦分別錄得超過50 000宗個案，新加坡則錄得超過4 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省去年共錄得超過3 500宗本地感染病例。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

基孔肯雅熱
—————

​截至今日下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2026-02-06 18:00,2026-02-06 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600594.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (February 6) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF). The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminds the public that temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions (including neighbouring Southeast Asian countries) remain favourable for mosquito breeding. When travelling to areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, the public should take measures to prevent mosquito bites, including wearing loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and applying insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body.

Dengue fever
----------------

  From January 30 to yesterday (February 5), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to Indonesia during the incubation period.

  As of yesterday, six imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 59 DF cases were recorded last year (2025), all of which were imported cases.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over 4 million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths were reported in 97 countries/territories.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. In 2025, Indonesia, India and Vietnam each recorded over 120 000 cases; Malaysia and Thailand each recorded over 50 000 cases; and Singapore also recorded over 4 000 cases.Meanwhile, the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention recorded over 3 500 locally infected cases in Guangdong Province in 2025.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

  As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
------------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

​The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生防護中心調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案,2026-02-06 17:37,2026-02-06 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600589.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（二月六日）正調查一宗侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染個案，同時提醒市民時刻注意個人和環境衞生，以減低被傳染這種嚴重疾病的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的46歲男子，他於二月三日出現發燒、頸痛、嘔吐和神智模糊，二月五日到廣華醫院急症室求診，需留院治療。他的腦脊液樣本經化驗後，證實對腦膜炎雙球菌呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為腦膜炎雙球菌血症。病人現時情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，病人獨居，潛伏期內沒有外遊。中心的調查仍然進行中。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這宗個案與本港早前錄得的確診個案有流行病學關連。

侵入性腦膜炎雙球菌感染是法定須呈報傳染病。中心今年至今錄得兩宗個案，而去年全年共錄得11宗個案。

腦膜炎雙球菌感染是由腦膜炎雙球菌所引起，主要經由直接接觸帶菌者的呼吸道分泌物（包括口鼻分泌物）而傳播。當細菌入侵血液（腦膜炎雙球菌血症）或包圍腦部及脊髓的內膜（流行性腦膜炎）時，可引致嚴重病症。腦膜炎雙球菌血症的病徵包括突發性發燒、劇烈頭痛、皮膚出現瘀斑及休克，嚴重者甚至會致命。流行性腦膜炎的病徵包括發高燒、劇烈頭痛、頸部僵硬及嗜睡，亦會有嘔吐、畏光或皮疹等情況出現，若情況嚴重更可造成腦部損害或死亡。

中心呼籲市民採取以下預防措施以預防腦膜炎雙球菌感染：


用梘液和清水正確洗手，尤其在雙手被呼吸道分泌物污染時，如打噴嚏後。當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，可用酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時應掩着口鼻，用紙巾包裹痰涎，棄置於有蓋的垃圾桶內，並即時洗手；
避免到人多擠迫的地方；
避免與出現發燒或劇烈頭痛病徵的病人作親密接觸；
前往高危地區前，應諮詢醫生有關接種腦膜炎雙球菌疫苗的詳情；及
從高危地區返港後若感到不適，應立即求診，並告知醫生近期曾到訪的地區。


市民可參閱衞生防護中心網頁以取得更多有關腦膜炎雙球菌感染的資料。"
CHP investigates case of invasive meningococcal infection,2026-02-06 17:37,2026-02-06 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600601.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (February 6) is investigating a case of invasive meningococcal infection, and reminds the public to maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times to minimise the risk of contracting this serious disease.

  The case involves a 46-year-old male with good past health. He presented with a fever, neck pain, vomiting and confusion on February 3. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital on February 5 and was hospitalised. His cerebrospinal fluid specimen tested positive for Neisseria meningitidis upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was meningococcaemia.He is currently in a stable condition.

  An initial investigation revealed that the patient lives alone and had no travel history during the incubation period. The CHP's investigation is ongoing. Initial findings suggest that this is a sporadic case with no epidemiological linkages to previously confirmed cases in Hong Kong.

  Meningococcal infection is a statutory notifiable disease. The CHP has recorded two cases this year so far. A total of 11 cases were recorded last year.

  Meningococcal infection is caused by a bacterium known as meningococcus. It is mainly transmitted by direct contact with respiratory secretions, including droplets from the nose and throat, of infected persons. Severe illness may result when the bacteria invade the bloodstream (meningococcaemia) or the membranes that envelop the brain and spinal cord (meningococcal meningitis). Meningococcaemia is characterised by a sudden onset of fever, an intense headache, purpura, shock and even death in severe cases. Meningococcal meningitis is characterised by high fever, severe headache, stiff neck followed by drowsiness, vomiting, fear of bright light, or rash; it can cause brain damage or even death.

  To prevent meningococcal infection, members of the public are advised to take the following measures:


Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly, especially when they are soiled by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing, and clean hands with alcohol-based handrub when they are not visibly soiled;
Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, hold the saliva with a tissue, dispose of nasal and mouth discharge in a lidded rubbish bin, and wash hands immediately;
Avoid crowded places;
Avoid close contact with patients who have a fever or severe headache;
Consult doctors about meningococcal vaccination before travelling to high-risk areas; and
Seek medical advice if you become ill after returning from high-risk areas, and discuss your recent travel history with your doctor.

內地春節黃金周期間，全港各區將舉行一系列豐富的慶祝活動，包括二月十七日（年初一）舉辦的大年初一國泰新春國際匯演之夜，以及在二月十八日（年初二）的農曆新年煙花匯演。香港警務處會安排足夠警力，按需要實施相應的人群管理措施和特別交通安排，確保所有慶祝活動安全有序地進行。而各區民政事務處亦會密切留意區內的旅客人流情況，並按實際情況通報相關部門，以加強相關地點的管理安排。

特區政府經審慎考慮相關情況，包括香港今年農曆新年假期期間大型活動的舉行時間及相關安排，以及二〇二四年農曆新年延長個別口岸通關時間的經驗，並經與內地相關部門溝通協調，決定在今年農曆新年假期期間維持現行通關時間。落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋口岸會如常24小時通關。特區政府呼籲旅客提前規劃行程，並在參與各項本地農曆新年慶祝活動後留港過夜，充分體驗香港各區豐富多元的慶祝活動，感受香港獨特的城市魅力。

口岸部門已減少前線人員休假，以便彈性調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱、臨時櫃枱及通道以疏導人流及車流。由警務處、入境處、香港海關及相關部門成立的跨部門聯合指揮中心，會於二月十四日（星期六）至二月二十三日（星期一）啓動，實時監察口岸現場情況，並與內地口岸部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制保持緊密聯繫，於有需要時作出迅速應變及調動，靈活調配各管制站人手，確保陸路口岸運作暢順。保安局亦會在內地春節黃金周期間啓動緊急事故監察及支援中心，密切監察和統籌各口岸的公眾秩序。中心並會在有需要時協調跨部門的跟進行動，以迅速應對各種突發情況。

公共運輸安排方面，運輸署已主動聯繫各相關公共運輸營運商加大運力，並在進出境高峰期間預留足夠備用車輛及人手以應對乘客的出行需求；其中，香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）將於二月十三日（星期五）至二十三日（星期一）期間重點加強東鐵綫不同時段的列車服務，而大部分本地鐵路線會於二月十六日（星期一，年廿九）提供通宵服務，並因應二月十七日（年初一）的花車巡遊及二月十八日（年初二）的煙花匯演加強服務，以方便本地市民和旅客出行。運輸署亦會配合口岸安排，已協調相關營運商加強連接各邊境管制站的交通服務，包括增加港珠澳大橋穿梭巴士（金巴）的班次至最高峰時約一分鐘一班、增加落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）的班次至最密約兩分鐘一班，以及增發跨境直通巴士配額以加強服務；並制定預案，在有需要時於港珠澳大橋口岸、落馬洲／皇崗口岸及深圳灣口岸實施特別交通管理安排，包括啓動公共交通專用通道，確保公交服務暢順。另外，在二月十七日（星期二，年初一）至二月十九日（星期四，年初三）凌晨，加設九巴第N73號特別巴士服務（港鐵上水站往新田），在東鐵綫前往羅湖站的服務結束後，接載乘客轉乘皇巴，經24小時通關的落馬洲／皇崗口岸前往內地。

運輸署的緊急事故交通協調中心於內地春節黃金周期間24小時運作，全面監察全港各區（包括旅客熱點）、各邊境管制站和主要車站的交通和公共運輸服務情況，並適時採取措施，應對服務需求，並透過各種渠道發放最新的交通消息。

因應內地春節黃金周期間到訪西貢萬宜水庫東壩及鹹田灣等營地的旅客數量或會明顯增加，警方已作出針對性的部署，包括調派軍裝人員於旅客抵達及離開之高峰時段在北潭涌、西貢萬宜路及東壩的策略性位置進行交通及人流管制；漁農自然護理署（漁護署）繼早前加建圍障及豎立警告牌等安全措施外，亦會在有需要時於萬宜地質步道─破邊洲段入口實施臨時人流管制措施，避免景點過度擠擁；而運輸署已與專線小巴營辦商協調，因應乘客量增加第9A號線（北潭涌—萬宜水庫東壩）的小巴班次。另外，政府已加強於鹹田灣、西灣及浪茄灣的管理工作，以鹹田灣的營地及公廁為例，漁護署及食物環境衞生署會在今個周末（二月七日及八日）及在二月十四日至二十三日期間聯合採取特別管理安排，包括每日安排人手清潔營地及清理垃圾桶和安排廁所事務員值勤，加強營地巡邏及宣傳教育，以及安裝網絡攝錄機以監察公廁外圍的清潔情況。

旅行團管理及保障旅客安排

旅監局已提醒接待內地入境旅行團的旅行代理商盡量分散入境時間，並協調景點等相關單位採取適當分流措施，做好人流和旅遊巴的管理工作，為旅客帶來良好旅遊體驗。旅監局亦會巡查入境旅行團註冊商店較多的地區，以及向旅客和導遊提供協助，以保障入境旅行團旅客的權益。此外，警方會繼續加強執法，打擊的士司機濫收車資、拒載等違法行為，海關亦會加強巡查接待旅客的店鋪，打擊不良營商手法。
​
為確保旅遊景點，如尖沙咀海傍及山頂等一帶交通暢順，警方將會加強執法，打擊造成交通擠塞的相關罪行，以及對造成嚴重阻塞或即時危險的違泊車輛，在沒有事前警告的情況下票控及即時拖走。

天氣預報

由於內地春節黃金周期間本港仍是冬季，預料本港間中會受季候風影響而氣溫下降，但受暴雨或熱帶氣旋等惡劣天氣影響的機會不大。香港天文台會盡早發放相關天氣資訊，旅客出遊前請留意天文台的九天天氣預報及最新天氣警告信息。

資訊發布

為便利旅客規劃行程，跨部門工作小組及相關部門會加強資訊發布，包括最新入境旅客數字、各邊境管制站情況、活動資訊、交通安排及最新天氣信息等，方便市民及旅客按最新情況規劃行程。

香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）已推出一站式新春節慶專頁（www.discoverhongkong.com/tc/what-s-new/events/chinese-new-year.html），匯聚全港主要的賀歲活動及內地春節黃金周期間的實用資訊，包括主要旅遊景點開放時間、輪候時間、各項特色慶祝活動詳情，以及各項公共交通、過境服務安排等資訊，方便旅客提早計劃新春行程，深入體驗香港的節慶文化。旅發局亦加強在內地宣傳，透過與內地熱門平台及人氣網紅合作，推廣香港地道美食及新春特色體驗，吸引更多內地旅客訪港消費，提升整體旅遊體驗。

市民及旅客亦可瀏覽保安局推出的一站式過關資訊平台「口岸通」（www.sb.gov.hk/chi/bwt/status.html?type=outbound），一次過取得各陸路邊境管制站旅客和私家車過關平均輪候時間，以及港珠澳大橋過境穿梭巴士和落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士的平均輪候時間等有用資訊，以便計劃行程及減省等候時間。"

Each awardee from testing and certification (T&C) bodies and practitioners was presented with a trophy and an award certificate at the event, which was attended by over 200 industry representatives, guests and awardees.

  The Award Scheme is a biennial flagship event for the local T&C industry. This year, both applications and awardees reached record highs, reflecting the industry's support for and acknowledgement of the importance of manpower development. A total of 71 awards were presented to 46 outstanding T&C bodies in talent training and professional development, and 25 T&C practitioners in recognition of their striving for continuous learning and commitment to service excellence.

  The Chairman of the HKCTC, Professor Wong Wing-tak, highlighted that talent was a vital asset for the sustainable development of the industry. The Award Scheme fully demonstrated the industry's commitment to nurturing talent and showcased the rich pool of talent in the T&C industry. The success of the industry depended on the participation and collaboration of its practitioners to build a better society.

  The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, spoke highly of the T&C industry's contributions to Hong Kong's economy and innovation and technology development. He said that the professional integrity of the T&C industry has forged the prestigious brand of ""Tested in Hong Kong, Certified in Hong Kong"". It plays a key role in supporting the development of Hong Kong's trade, industrial, and other service sectors. He said he hopes the industry will continue to contribute its professional expertise to the development of Hong Kong and the country.

  Since its first launch in 2021, the Award Scheme includes two categories of awards - the Testing and Certification Manpower Development Corporate Award and the Excellent Testing and Certification Professional Award. There are two tiers of awards, i.e. the Platinum Award and the Gold Award under the Corporate Award category. As regards the Professional Award category, it encompasses two sub-groups of the Senior Professional and Junior Professional respectively.

  The Award Scheme has received tremendous support from the T&C industry as well as different stakeholders. The 19 supporting organisations are the Association of Construction Materials Laboratories; BEAM Society Limited; the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Department of Chemistry); City University of Hong Kong (Department of Chemistry); the Consumer Council; the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce; the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology); the Gemmological Association of Hong Kong; the Hong Kong Association of Medical Laboratories; the Hong Kong Association for Testing, Inspection and Certification; the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce; the Hong Kong Institution of Certified Auditors; the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers - Materials Division; Hong Kong Metropolitan University (School of Science and Technology); Hong Kong Society for Quality; the Hong Kong Trade Development Council; the Qualifications Framework Secretariat; the Hong Kong Young Academy of Sciences; and the Vocational Training Council.

  Applications received for the two categories of awards were respectively assessed (including conducting interviews with applicants for the Professional Award) by two independent Assessment Panels, which comprised members from academia, public bodies and industrial associations, to decide on the awardees. The lists of awardees are available on HKCTC website (www.hkctc.gov.hk/en/events-promotion/award-scheme2526)."
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and importing prohibited articles not under and in accordance with import licence (with photo),2026-02-06 17:10,2026-02-06 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600473.htm,"​An incoming male passenger was sentenced to two months' imprisonment and fined $2,000 by the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts today (February 6) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing prohibited articles not under and in accordance with the import licence, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

 Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 42, at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point on February 5. About 2 174 duty-not-paid cigarettes and five tablets of pharmaceutical products labelled as containing Part I Poisons, with a total estimated market value of about $11,000 and a duty potential of about $7,100, were seized from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

 Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

 Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

 Under the IEO, any person who imports pharmaceutical products and medicines without a valid import licence commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

 Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
CS chairs interdepartmental working group meeting on festival arrangements (with photos),2026-02-06 17:10,2026-02-06 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600576.htm,"  The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, today (February 6) chaired a meeting of the interdepartmental working group on festival arrangements to holistically co-ordinate and steer the preparatory work of various government departments for welcoming visitors to Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland (i.e. from February 15 to 23). The Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Liu Chun-sun; the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, and representatives from other relevant government departments also attended.

  Mr Chan said, ""We are approaching the nine-day Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. Various celebration activities will take place to create a rich New Year ambience for residents and visitors. We estimate a notable increase in visitor arrivals during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will make good preparations for receiving visitors, including diligently co-ordinating the ancillary arrangements of boundary control points (BCPs) and transportation, as well as maintaining close liaison with relevant organisations and the travel trade to prepare well for crowd management, information dissemination and arrangements of public transportation and BCPs, with a view to ensuring the smooth operation of various aspects in receiving visitors and offering a high-quality experience to them.""

Estimated visitor flow and preparatory work

  According to the Immigration Department (ImmD)'s estimate, around 1.43 million Mainland visitors will visit Hong Kong via various sea, land and air control points during the nine-day Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. Compared with last year's Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, the daily average visitor arrivals will increase by about 6 per cent.

  According to the estimate of the Travel Industry Authority (TIA) and the trade, it is anticipated that 2 200 inbound tour groups will visit Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, with the average daily number of inbound tour groups notably higher than that of last year’s Labour Day and National Day Golden Week of the Mainland. Major tourist spots have formulated special arrangements to handle the estimated increase in people flow. The Hong Kong community is expected to become more vibrant and highly patronised during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, bringing opportunities to various sectors.

  There will be a rich array of activities across the territory during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. Major events include the Cathay International Chinese New Year Night Parade on February 17 (Lunar New Year's Day) and the Lunar New Year Fireworks Display on February 18 (the second day of Lunar New Year). The Hong Kong Police Force will ensure sufficient police manpower to implement corresponding crowd management measures and special traffic arrangements as necessary for the events to be conducted in a safe and orderly manner. District offices will also closely monitor the flow of visitors within their respective districts and notify relevant departments having regard to the actual circumstances with a view to strengthening management of the relevant spots.

Co-ordinate control points, traffic and public transport facilities

  The HKSAR Government has given due consideration to the relevant circumstances, including the schedules and arrangements of mega events in Hong Kong during the Chinese New Year holiday this year, as well as the experience of extending the operating hours of individual BCPs during the 2024 Chinese New Year, and decided, in discussion with relevant Mainland authorities, to maintain the existing operating hours of the BCPs during this year's Chinese New Year holiday. The Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Port will maintain a 24-hour operation as usual. The HKSAR Government appeals to visitors to plan ahead for their itineraries and stay overnight after participating in various local celebratory activities for the Chinese New Year to fully enjoy the rich and diverse celebratory activities to be held across various districts in the city and experience Hong Kong's unique city charm.

  Relevant departments have minimised leave for frontline officers to enable flexible deployment of manpower and operation of additional counters, temporary counters and channels, with a view to diverting passenger and vehicular flow. The Inter-departmental Joint Command Centre set up by the Police, the ImmD, the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), and other relevant departments will be activated from February 14 (Saturday) to February 23 (Monday) to monitor the real-time situation at various control points. The Joint Command Centre will maintain close liaison with the Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanism and take timely contingency actions as necessary to flexibly deploy manpower at BCPs to ensure smooth operation of the land control points. The Security Bureau will activate the Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland to closely monitor and co-ordinate the public order situation at various BCPs and facilitate interdepartmental follow-up actions where necessary to respond promptly to various kinds of emergencies.

  For public transport arrangements, the Transport Department (TD) has proactively approached various public transport operators to enhance their capacity and reserve sufficient vehicles and manpower to meet the travel needs of visitors during peak periods. Among them, the MTR Corporation Limited will significantly enhance the service of the East Rail Line at different periods during the period between February 13 (Friday) and February 23 (Monday). Most local railway lines will operate overnight on February 16 (Monday, Lunar New Year’s Eve). Services on the relevant railway lines will be strengthened after the Night Parade on February 17 (Lunar New Year’s Day) and the Fireworks Display on February 18 (the second day of Lunar New Year) for the convenience of residents and visitors. The TD will also cater for the arrangements of BCPs and has co-ordinated with relevant operators to enhance transportation services connecting various BCPs, including increasing the frequency of HZMB shuttle bus (Gold Bus) to about one minute during peak hours, and Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) to about two minutes at its highest frequency, as well as increasing the quota of cross-boundary coaches to strengthen services, and formulating a contingency plan by implementing special traffic control measures as necessary, including providing a dedicated passage for public transport vehicles at the HZMB Port, the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port and the Shenzhen Bay Port to ensure smooth public transport services. Furthermore, in the early hours from February 17 (Tuesday, Lunar New Year's Day) to February 19 (Thursday, the third day of Lunar New Year), after the service hours of the East Rail Line trains to Lo Wu Station, special bus service of KMB Route No. N73 (MTR Sheung Shui Station to San Tin) will be provided to carry passengers to interchange to the Yellow Bus for their journey to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang Port, which operates round-the-clock.

  The Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre of the TD will operate 24 hours a day during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland to closely monitor the traffic conditions and public transport services in all districts (including tourist hotspots), BCPs, and major stations across Hong Kong and take prompt measures to address service demands and disseminate the latest traffic updates through various channels.

  In view of the anticipated large number of tourists visiting Sai Kung High Island Reservoir East Dam and campsites including Ham Tin Wan Campsite during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, the Police have taken targeted measures, including deploying uniformed officers at strategic locations at Pak Tam Chung, Sai Kung Man Yee Road and East Dam, for traffic and crowd management during peak visitor arrival and departure periods. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), in addition to safety measures implemented earlier such as adding barriers and putting up warning signs, will implement temporary crowd control measures at the entrance of the High Island Geo Trail - Po Pin Chau Section when necessary to prevent overcrowding at the site. The TD has co-ordinated with the operator to enhance the service of GMB Route No. 9A (Pak Tam Chung - High Island Reservoir East Dam) subject to passenger demand. Furthermore, the Government has strengthened management efforts at Ham Tin Wan, Sai Wan, and Long Ke Wan. For instance, at the campsite and public toilets in Ham Tin Wan, the AFCD and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department will jointly implement special management arrangements this weekend (February 7 and 8) and from February 14 to 23. These measures include deploying staff daily to clean the campsite and empty trash bins, assigning toilet attendants on duty, enhancing campsite patrols and public education, and installing network cameras to monitor the cleanliness of the areas around the public toilets.

Management of tour groups and protection of visitors

  The TIA has reminded travel agents receiving Mainland inbound tour groups to stagger arrival times as far as possible, and co-ordinate with relevant parties including attractions to adopt appropriate diversion measures to enable proper management of visitor flows and tour buses, with a view to offering a pleasant travel experience to visitors. The TIA will also conduct inspections in districts where relatively more registered shops for inbound tour groups are located, and offer assistance to visitors and tourist guides to protect inbound tour group visitors' rights. Additionally, the Police will continue to step up enforcement actions against the illegal acts of taxi drivers including overcharging and refusing hire. The C&ED will also step up inspection of shops serving visitors to combat unfair trade practices.

  To ensure smooth traffic flow in tourist areas such as the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront and the Peak, the Police will step up enforcement actions against offenses causing traffic congestion. Illegally parked vehicles that cause serious obstruction or pose an immediate danger will be ticketed and towed away immediately without prior warning.

Weather forecast

  As Hong Kong will still be in winter during the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland, it is expected that the city may occasionally experience temperature drops due to the monsoon. The chances of being affected by severe weather such as heavy rain or tropical cyclones are relatively low. The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) will release relevant weather information as early as possible. Travellers are advised to check the HKO’s nine-day weather forecast and the latest weather warnings before travelling.

Information dissemination

  To assist visitors in planning their itineraries, the interdepartmental working group and relevant departments will strengthen information dissemination, including the latest inbound visitor arrivals, the situation at various BCPs, information on events, transport arrangements, and latest weather forecast, to enable residents and visitors to plan their itineraries according to the latest situation.

  The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) has launched a one-stop Chinese New Year festive webpage (www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/what-s-new/events/chinese-new-year.html), which consolidates major Chinese New Year events in Hong Kong and practical information for the Chinese New Year Golden Week of the Mainland. The webpage includes information about the opening hours and waiting times of major tourist attractions, information on unique celebratory activities, and updates on public transport and cross-border service arrangements, enabling visitors to plan their trips in advance and experience Hong Kong’s festive culture in depth. The HKTB has also stepped up promotions on the Mainland by partnering with popular platforms and influencers to showcase authentic local delicacies and unique Chinese New Year experiences to attract more Mainland visitors to visit and spend in Hong Kong and enhance their overall travel experiences.

  Residents and visitors may visit ""Easy Boundary"" (www.sb.gov.hk/eng/bwt/status.html?type=outbound), a one-stop information platform on immigration clearance launched by the Security Bureau, to obtain useful information on ""Easy Boundary"" in one go, including the respective average waiting times for passengers and private cars at land BCPs, as well as for the HZMB cross-boundary shuttle bus and the Lok Ma Chau-Huanggang cross-boundary shuttle bus, to plan their trips and save waiting times."

二月份第一批涵蓋27個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數，全部均為0%，顯示白紋伊蚊的分布情況並不廣泛。

與上月（即二○二六年一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這27個監察區中，全部監察地區的指數均下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自二○二五年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區62個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。在監察期間，食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the first batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 27 survey areas in February, all were 0 per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.

Among these 27 survey areas, all recorded a decrease or remained unchanged as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month (i.e. January 2026), representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August 2025, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever (DF). At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 62 survey areas of the community, with a surveillance period of two weeks. During the surveillance period, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

運輸及物流局局長在《運輸策略藍圖》記者會開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-06 16:46,2026-02-06 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600541.htm,"​以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（二月六日）在《運輸策略藍圖》（《藍圖》）記者會的開場發言：

各位市民、各位傳媒朋友：

交通運輸是現代都市的基石，關係着經濟發展，大灣區融合，更重要是市民生活的日常。我們團隊按最新的土地規劃，考慮最新的科技發展，制訂了《運輸策略藍圖》，定出未來的工作目標、策略和方向，制定短、中、長期的措施，為香港的經濟發展謀動力，令市民的生活更便捷。

《藍圖》以「政策創新」與「技術創新」的「雙創新」思維，前瞻未來二十多年的發展願景。我們將繼續以鐵路為骨幹，並會提升公共交通服務及促進運輸發展進一步邁向智能化、靈活化；亦會促進跨境交通，加強人流與物流的互聯互通。

《藍圖》所訂的三大主題與六大策略架構共提出25項具體建議，稍後同事會作較詳細的介紹。最重要的是，在勾劃宏觀、前瞻的布局的同時，亦要令市民感受到，我們可以回應市民需要、增加便利，以及日常出行時所關注的事項。在此，我想先特別提出今年內我們的10項重點措施：

（一）首先是基建，我們會強化本地和跨境運輸基建，在「八縱八橫」的運輸基建布局下，首要在今年內全線開通六號幹線，全力推展一系列鐵路及主要道路項目。我們亦會開展研究港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）南向延伸方案，加上在策略地點如洪水橋、新田、紅磡等規劃多元化、最新的運輸交匯樞紐，連通港九新界、市區及北部都會區各個經濟和居住區域，帶動經濟發展、促進人員往來及加快貨物暢通流動；

（二）第二亦與「八縱八橫」相關，我們會研究擴大過海交通容量不同方案的可行性，包括現有倡議的走線或擴建現有隧道等；

（三）在啟德、東九龍及洪水橋／厦村新發展區推展智慧綠色集體運輸系統。啟德的項目將於今年內批出合約，而東九龍及洪水橋／厦村新發展區的項目（第一階段）亦會於今年內招標；

（四）公共交通方面，本港公交系統「世一」，每日接近九成出行人次使用公交出行。我們會善用科技，為乘客提供更具效率的公交服務。我們會於今年內推出「需求導向智慧公交」的試行路線，目的是在現行公交服務之上，透過靈活調派車輛，照顧乘客需求。我們會與專營巴士公司一同探討不同應用場景，例如在偏遠地區或是客流較分散的時段提供加強服務；

（五）在個人化點對點服務方面，預計首批持牌網約車平台最快可於今年第四季開始營運，讓的士與網約車並存互補；

（六）對駕駛者來講，我們會致力透過「一地多用」提供泊車位、自動泊車系統等一系列措施增加車位供應。我們正推進在今年內達成我們於去年定下兩年間新增逾12 000個私家車及商用車位的目標。我們亦將展開新一輪泊車位供求研究，全面檢視尤其是商用車的停泊情況及需求，長遠做到「商用車輛，夜有所泊」；

（七）科技應用方面，我們將緊貼大數據和人工智能發展，推動數字化交通管理，令市民出行更具效率。我們會籌備市區內首個交通管理平台試點應用項目，向公眾提供更多、更實時的交通資訊以規劃行程；

（八）成立由運輸署署長主持的自動駕駛車輛應用促進工作組，跨部門聯同行業持份者審視自動車項目的進度與需求，訂立自動駕駛載客營運路線圖，並就自動車的測試地點及車輛類別，以及為配合自動車邁向商業營運所需要的牌證安排提供督導。最重要的是，我們會在今年內努力爭取陸續推出多個跨區項目，包括「航天走廊」載客服務、積極推進在東涌、機場及啟德等項目邁向無人化；

（九）積極布局低空經濟，制訂《發展低空經濟規劃行動綱領》，構建具國際競爭力的低空經濟生態圈，促進現代運輸發展。「監管沙盒」中多於20個較為成熟、風險相對較低的項目，例如無人機進行外牆清洗、電纜、鐵路設施檢視等會進入實際運作；及

（十）我們務求做到人車兼顧，因此更會便利行人，令出行體驗更佳、更省時。我們擴展實時燈號調節，以人工智能分析路口的即時車流和行人流量，計算最合適的燈號時間，加強路口運作效率；亦會在全港更多地點設立對角行人過路處，減少行人通過十字路口的時間。

以上是《藍圖》下今年的重點工作。《藍圖》以宏觀視野為香港未來20年的發展提供動力之外，我亦希望每位市民能夠在當中感受到我們以一個字，就是「人」作為核心思想，期望令大家在不久的將來，便可在日常的生活細節中，感受到更完善的交通網絡、更貼心的公交服務和更易行的城市環境所帶來的好處。

整體而言，《藍圖》的制定響應國家策略，對接「十五五規劃」建議，透過宏觀的基建布局，結合科技創新，吸引國家交通科企來港，共同構建香港未來的運輸體系，以支撐本港的金融、航運、貿易中心的高效運作，連接全球，促進區域協同發展，以及發揮本港內聯外通優勢的戰略使命。

我現在請運輸署助理署長梁世豪介紹重點策略和其他比較仔細及長遠的建議。請梁助理署長，謝謝。"

Grading of beach water quality released,2026-02-06 16:00,2026-02-06 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600494.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (February 6) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1) and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, Casam Beach has been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."
環保署公布泳灘等級,2026-02-06 16:00,2026-02-06 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600493.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）今日（二月六日）公布六個全年開放的憲報公布泳灘的最新等級評定結果。

四個泳灘的水質被評為良好（一級），兩個為一般（二級）。

一級泳灘包括：



清水灣第二灣泳灘
黃金泳灘


深水灣泳灘
銀線灣泳灘




二級泳灘包括：



更生灣泳灘
麗都灣泳灘




比較上周公布的泳灘等級，更生灣泳灘由一級轉為二級。

環保署發言人說：「這些泳灘水質的轉變屬一般泳灘細菌水質的正常變動。」

環保署根據海水中的大腸桿菌水平，將泳灘水質評定為四個等級，包括良好（一級）、一般（二級）、欠佳（三級）及極差（四級）。泳灘等級是根據最近五次水樣本中大腸桿菌的幾何平均數而計算。

環保署發言人提醒市民，雖然泳灘的等級反映泳灘於一般情況下的水質，但泳灘的水質在大雨期間及過後或會暫時受到影響，泳客應該避免在風暴或大雨後三天內前往泳灘游泳。

環保署會在每個周末前公布各泳灘等級摘要。市民可於環保署網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach_chi）查閱根據最新數據評定的泳灘等級，或致電環保署泳灘水質熱線2511 6666查詢。市民亦可透過環保署的泳灘水質預測專題網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/BWQForecast），獲取各開放予公眾使用的泳灘的每日最新水質預測資訊。"
環保署利用創新聲學超材料減少噪音影響　提升工程效率（附圖）,2026-02-06 15:55,2026-02-06 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600274.htm,"環境保護署（環保署）今日（二月六日）表示，透過與路政署協作，將由塑膠回收再造成的創新聲學超材料應用於路政署在大埔運頭角里的一項道路重鋪工程，顯著減少工程噪音對鄰近居民的影響，成功將原先施工時間由三晚壓縮至一整天。

由於受日間的交通限制，一般道路維修工程往往需要在深夜或假日封路才可進行，而環保署亦會根據《噪音管制條例》發出建築噪音許可證，要求承建商在施工時必須盡量減低建築噪音對附近環境的影響。因此，道路工程的計劃和時間表須配合臨時交通措施，並受到手提破碎機等產生較大噪音的機動設備一般只能在平日午夜前才可運作的限制，令工程每天的規模變得相當有限。若以傳統方法施工，有關大埔運頭角里的道路重鋪工程需要三晚分階段完成。

在環保署、路政署、相關部門與承建商的協調下，大埔運頭角里的工程採用了先進的靜音電動破碎機及聲學超材料隔音罩，成功降低地面破碎工作噪音高達15分貝（A），大幅減低工程對鄰近居民及社區的影響，滿足居民生活及各種社區活動的需要。

該段約三百米長的道路於二月一日（星期日）從上午八時至晚上十時完成相關工作，包括刨去路面舊瀝青、打鑿、清理、重鋪及壓平等，施工一整天後於晚上十時重開有關路段，相比原先需要三晚完成，提升效率之餘亦減少連續數天影響居民作息。此外，聲學超材料隔音罩較傳統的隔音罩輕巧，易於移動，而其三面百葉的設計亦能確保良好的通風，保障工人的健康安全，並顯著改善施工環境。

工程期間，環保署一直與各持份者，包括當區區議員、附近居民、教會、老人院、警方等保持緊密聯繫，最後成功展示了一種多方共贏的模式，鄰近居民及社區團體均對這次道路重鋪工程反應正面。

在發展稠密的香港都市內進行道路維修工程面臨諸多挑戰，展望未來，環保署將繼續與工程項目倡議者攜手合作，在道路工程中更廣泛地應用這項創新技術，我們期望在未來可利用此技術把必要的晚間道路維修工程由多晚盡量壓縮至在假日一整天內完成，以期對市民的影響減至最低。"
EPD utilises innovative acoustic metamaterials to reduce noise impact and enhance project efficiency (with photos),2026-02-06 15:55,2026-02-06 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600279.htm,"The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (February 6) said that, together with the Highways Department (HyD), they have collaboratively implemented the innovative acoustic metamaterials made from recycled plastics in an HyD road resurfacing work on Wan Tau Kok Lane in Tai Po. The new innovative acoustic metamaterials significantly minimised noise impact on nearby residents and hence compressed the construction work period from the originally three nights to one whole day.

 Due to daytime traffic constraints, road maintenance works are generally conducted at night or on general holidays during road closure. The EPD will issue a construction noise permit under the Noise Control Ordinance, requiring contractors to minimise the construction noise impact on the surrounding environment during construction works. As a result, the planning and scheduling of road works must co-ordinate with temporary traffic arrangements and the limitation imposed by noisy powered mechanical equipment, such as handheld breakers that can generally only operate before midnight on weekdays, which further limit the daily project scale. Three nights are needed to complete the road resurfacing work in phases on Wan Tau Kok Lane by traditional construction methods.

 Through co-ordination among the EPD, the HyD, relevant departments and the contractor, the construction work on Wan Tau Kok Lane in Tai Po adopted advanced quiet electric handheld breakers and an acoustic metamaterial enclosure. This successfully reduced the noise levels from road breaking work by 15 decibels A, significantly minimising the impact of the project on nearby residents and the community, thus meeting the needs of residents' daily lives and various community activities.

 The construction work on the approximately 300-metre-long road was completed on February 1 (Sunday), from 8am to 10pm, encompassing processes such as removing the previous asphalt surface, breaking, cleansing, resurfacing and compacting, and the road section concerned was reopened at 10pm after a whole day of construction. This not only improved work efficiency compared to the original plan, which required three nights, but also minimised the impact on residents' lives over several days of construction. In addition, the acoustic metamaterial enclosure was lighter and more movable than the traditional enclosure, and the three-side louver design ensured good ventilation, enhancing workers' health and significantly improving the construction environment.

 Throughout this project, the EPD maintained close communication with stakeholders, including local district council members, nearby residents, churches, homes for the elderly, and the Police. This collaboration successfully demonstrated a win-win model, and local residents and community groups responded positively to this road resurfacing work.

 In Hong Kong's densely developed urban environment, roadworks present numerous challenges. Moving forward, the EPD will continue to collaborate with project proponents to widely apply the innovative technology in road projects, aiming to reduce necessary nighttime roadworks from several nights to one whole day on general holidays and minimise public impact."

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2026-02-06 14:57,2026-02-06 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600480.htm,"An incoming female passenger was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment and fined $600 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (February 6) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted a 34-year-old incoming female passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on February 4 and seized about 101 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $454,500 and a duty potential of about $334,000 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
本港水域紅潮報告,2026-02-06 14:20,2026-02-06 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600364.htm,"政府跨部門紅潮工作小組今日（二月六日）公布，過去一周在本港水域發現兩宗紅潮。

康樂文化事務署人員二月一日在香港島深水灣泳灘發現一宗紅潮。二月二日，環境保護署人員在長洲東灣泳灘發現另一宗紅潮。長洲東灣泳灘的紅潮已經消退，而深水灣泳灘的紅潮目前仍然持續，迄今並無收到相關的魚類死亡報告。

小組發言人說：「上述兩宗紅潮由常見於本港水域的球形棕囊藻組成。外國文獻指該藻類可能產生泡沫，或會影響魚類。」

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已提醒蘆荻灣、索罟灣、蒲台及長沙灣魚類養殖區養魚戶留意魚排情況，並適時增氧。

紅潮的出現為自然現象，漁護署實施的浮游植物監測計劃將繼續主動監測紅潮出現的情況，以減低對本地海魚養殖業及市民可能造成的影響。"
Red tides sighted,2026-02-06 14:20,2026-02-06 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/06/P2026020600365.htm,"Two red tides were sighted during the past week, the Inter-departmental Red Tide Working Group reported today (February 6).

On February 1, staff of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department spotted a red tide at Deep Water Bay Beach, Hong Kong Island. On February 2, staff of the Environmental Protection Department spotted another red tide at Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach. The red tide at Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach has dissipated, while the red tide at Deep Water Bay Beach still persists. No associated fish deaths have been reported as of today.

A spokesman for the working group said, ""Both red tides were formed by Phaeocystis globosa, which is commonly found in Hong Kong waters. According to literature overseas, the algal species can produce foam that may affect fish.""

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) urged mariculturists at the Lo Tik Wan, Sok Kwu Wan, Po Toi and Cheung Sha Wan fish culture zones to monitor the situation closely and increase aeration where necessary.

Red tide is a natural phenomenon. The AFCD's proactive phytoplankton monitoring programme will continue to monitor red tide occurrences to minimise the impact on the mariculture industry and the public."
