環境及生態局局長在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會政策簡報會開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-29 14:17,2026-01-29 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/29/P2026012900361.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（一月二十九日）在立法會食物安全及環境衞生事務委員會政策簡報會的開場發言：

各位委員，大家好。

環境及生態局轄下包括環境科及食物科。我在星期一向環境事務委員會介紹了環境科工作範疇和未來工作重點。

至於食物科的工作涵蓋民生和食品產業等不同範疇，負責制定和統籌食物安全、環境衞生、動物管理和福利、食品和漁農業等政策，和市民生活息息相關。我們積極回應社會需要，努力增加市民的幸福感。

今屆政府致力改善店鋪阻街和街道清潔，取得了顯著成果；引入了「專業核證制度」為食肆和食物製造廠牌照提供「先發牌、後審查」的選項，便利營商；協助「香港食品」銷售到內地市場，為肉製品和乳品輸往內地設立便利通關安排；內地大閘蟹方面，大家都知道亦恢復直接供港；與業界攜手制定了《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》，推動漁農業發展。

在推動人寵共融方面，我們大幅縮短了內地和一些其他地區進口貓狗的120天檢疫期，從120天縮減至30天；在改善殯葬服務方面，我們大力推展公眾靈灰安置所和重置火化爐；我們更利用多項科技提升轄下部門的服務水平、執法效率和職安健。

展望未來，我們會在這基礎上繼續推進和優化各項政策措施，對接「十五五」規劃精神，推進深層次改革，以新發展理念引領發展新質生產力，提升市民的生活質素，並為業界營造更有利的發展空間。

其中一個工作重點是落實《施政報告》的寵物友善措施，解除實施逾30年的法例禁令，讓經營者可以申請容許狗隻進入食肆，市民也有所選擇，目標在今年年中批出首輪申請。今年上半年，食環署（食物環境衞生署）亦會聯同各政府部門開始採用新模式，加快審批食肆露天座位申請，希望助力業界開拓更多商機。

與此同時，我們會大力推動本地食品產業發展，通過進一步深化與內地合作，增加獲准輸往內地的香港製造食品種類，以推廣「香港食品」品牌，強化香港作為食物樞紐的角色。同時，我們會繼續按《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》推動本地漁農業，全面促進業界採用現代化養殖和環保生產模式，並會推出本地漁農產品新統一品牌，配合認證、檢測及溯源機制，提升本地漁農產品競爭力。

至於環境衞生方面，我們會繼續投放資源和善用科技提升工作成效，以保障市民健康。其中，食環署聯同屋宇署會在今年上半年推出優化處理樓宇滲水流程的先導計劃。各項環境衞生措施說明我們對民生和城市管理的重視。我期望市民大眾支持我們的工作，讓香港成為一個更潔淨、更舒適、更宜居的城市。

我現在請常任秘書長楊碧筠透過投影片介紹一下食物科主要工作的最新進展，以及本年度的工作重點。待簡介完畢後，我很樂意和大家一起就相關工作交流。多謝各位。"

Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case involving river trade vessel with goods worth about $56 million seized (with photo),2026-01-29 13:00,2026-01-29 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/29/P2026012900288.htm,"Hong Kong Customs detected one suspected smuggling case involving a river trade vessel on January 21. Large batches of suspected smuggled goods with a total estimated market value of about $56 million were seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, the river trade vessel departing from Hong Kong for Macao was selected for inspection on the abovementioned date. Upon examination, Customs officers aboard the vessel found a large batch of suspected smuggled goods, including suspected pharmaceutical products, cosmetic injections, tobacco products, e-cigarette cartridges, watches, mobile phones, tablets and clothing.

Investigations are ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Being a government department primarily responsible for tackling smuggling activities, Customs has long been combating various smuggling activities on all fronts. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on relevant crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

The Federal Open Market Committee of the United StatesFederal Reserve (the Fed) announced earlier today (January 29, Hong Kong time) its decision to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at 3.50-3.75 per cent.

The policy decision is in line with market expectations. The market generally considers that the path of US monetary policy remains quite uncertain, depending on developments in inflation trend and labour market conditions.

Hong Kong's monetary and financial markets have continued to operate in an orderly manner. Under the Linked Exchange Rate System, Hong Kong dollar interbank rates generally track the US dollar counterparts, while shorter-tenor interbank rates tend to be also influenced by the supply and demand of Hong Kong dollar funding in the local market such as seasonal factors and capital market activities.

The future trend of US interest rates remains quite uncertain, which may influence the interest rate environment in Hong Kong. The public should carefully manage interest rate risks when making decisions about property purchase, investment or borrowing. The HKMA will continue to closely monitor market developments and maintain monetary and financial stability."

美國聯邦儲備局（美聯儲）聯邦公開市場委員會在香港時間今日（一月二十九日）清晨公布維持聯邦基金利率目標區間於3.50-3.75厘。

美聯儲維持息率不變的決定符合市場預期。市場普遍認為，美國未來的貨幣政策走向存在較大的不確定性，將取決於通脹走勢和就業市場情況。

香港方面，貨幣及金融市場保持有序運作。港元拆息在聯繫匯率制度下整體上趨近美元息率，而較短期限的拆息就同時受本地市場港元資金供求影響，例如季節性因素及資本市場活動。

美國未來息率走向仍存在不確定性，對香港的利率環境亦會有所影響，市民在作出置業、投資或借貸決定時，需充分考慮及管理利率風險。金管局會繼續密切監察市場變化，維持貨幣及金融穩定。"
Speech by SFST at Listing Ceremony of Hang Seng Gold ETF (English Only),2026-01-29 10:27,2026-01-29 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/29/P2026012900224.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Listing Ceremony of Hang Seng Gold ETF (exchange-traded fund) today (January 29):

Kelvin (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission, Dr Kelvin Wong), Luanne (Executive Director and Chief Executive of Hang Seng Bank, Ms Luanne Lim), Rosita (Director and Chief Executive Officer of Hang Seng Investment Management Limited, Ms Rosita Lee), ladies and gentlemen, and distinguished guests,

 Good morning. It is a great privilege to address you today as we mark a pivotal new chapter in Hong Kong's financial market. With our determined efforts to position the city as a premier international gold trading hub, as indicated by the Chief Executive's Policy Address, the listing of the Hang Seng Gold ETF represents strong support for this vision and contributes to the growth and innovation of Hong Kong's gold market.

 In recent years, sovereign and financial investors have increasingly sought diversification for reserves and asset allocation. Gold's attributes - as a commodity, an investment vehicle, and a safe-haven asset - have strengthened further, driving sustained price appreciation. Global gold demand in value terms surged 44 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of last year, reaching a record US$146 billion. Gold ETF holdings also rose substantially, climbing by 222 tonnes in the quarter to exceed 3 800 tonnes, underscoring robust investor appetite amid geopolitical uncertainties and market volatility.

 We are delighted to welcome the listing of the Hang Seng Gold ETF. As the first ETF in Hong Kong that supports physical gold redemption at bank, it seamlessly blends the flexibility and liquidity of an ETF with the security of physical commodities. This enables smooth trading, secure storage, and flexible redemption - all conducted entirely within Hong Kong. We are also encouraged by the continued momentum of financial innovation here and look forward to even greater advancements. The exploration of distribution through licensed digital asset exchanges will help bridge traditional and digital finance, unlocking new opportunities.

 This initiative aligns fully with the vision set out in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, which calls for accelerated development of a world-class international gold trading market. Key measures include establishing a central clearing system for gold in Hong Kong that provides efficient, reliable services in strict compliance with international standards, while inviting participation from the Shanghai Gold Exchange to facilitate collaboration with the Mainland.

 A landmark milestone was achieved this Monday with the signing of a co-operation agreement between my bureau and the Shanghai Gold Exchange at the Asian Financial Forum earlier this week. This partnership lays a solid foundation for Hong Kong's gold central clearing system to connect with the Mainland market.

 The Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited, wholly owned by the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government, will operate this system. Together with our partners, we will drive its efficient development, ensuring alignment with international standards and also promoting greater trust, transparency, and innovation in the gold market.

 In closing, I wish the listing every success. By working hand in hand with the market, we are building a more connected, efficient, and innovative gold ecosystem that benefits investors regionally and also globally. Thank you."

Latest figures of primary healthcare services provided by Health Bureau to residents affected by Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire,2026-01-29 10:00,2026-01-29 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/29/P2026012800555.htm,"  The Health Bureau (HHB) announced earlier the medical support provided for residents affected by the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. At present, the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts in Hong Kong serve as hubs to co-ordinate various primary healthcare services as needed for the affected residents. The HHB announced today (January 29) the latest figures of these services:

DHC hotlines

  Under the co-ordination of the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the DHCs across all 18 districts in Hong Kong have set up hotlines since December 1, 2025, (see Annex 1) to provide personalised case management services for affected residents, offering more convenient and comprehensive medical support. The support includes pairing the affected residents with free consultation services provided by private family doctors and Chinese medicine (CM) practitioners, co-ordinating arrangements for follow-up appointments and medication refills at the Hospital Authority (HA)'s Family Medicine Out-patient (FMOP) Services as necessary, and making referrals to necessary healthcare, nursing and medication services, as well as psychological support. The services co-ordinated by DHCs are not subject to district boundaries. For example, the Centres may assist affected residents in transferring HA FMOP follow-up appointments and medication refill service points, from Tai Po District to another location, thereby sparing residents the need for travelling across districts. As of January 27, the DHCs hotlines across all 18 districts have received 369 enquiries in total.

Free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners and free denture replacement services

  The HHB introduced a free family doctor service scheme, free CM consultation services, and free denture replacement services on December 4, 15, and 23, 2025, respectively to support the primary healthcare needs of the affected residents until February 28 this year. Case managers of the DHCs will arrange for them to receive up to three free consultations by family doctors and CM practitioners respectively based on their individual situations and preferences, covering the provision of medication and related treatments; and at least one free dental consultation and one follow-up appointment (subject to clinical need), covering denture replacement and oral treatment services.

  As of January 27, more than 300 private family doctors have participated in the free family doctor service scheme, covering more than 450 service points that include eight private hospitals. So far, 97 referrals have been handled. As for the free CM consultation services, more than 360 CM practitioners have participated, covering more than 620 service points, and 64 referrals have been handled so far. Regarding free denture replacement services, more than 110 private dentists have participated, covering over 150 service points, and 31 referrals have been handled so far.

HA's healthcare services

  All individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the HA will receive full fee waivers for all necessary healthcare services (including drugs and medical devices) throughout the entire process of their treatment and rehabilitation. A total of 79 patients received treatment at various public hospitals due to the fire. As of January 27, 75 of them had already recovered and were discharged, and the remaining four are in stable condition. Healthcare staff will continue to provide appropriate treatment and care to these patients.

  Moreover, all residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) are eligible for full medical fee waivers until December 31 this year. The waivers cover in-patient services, family medicine and specialist out-patient clinics (SOPCs) services (including psychiatry SOPCs), accident and emergency services, day hospitals, day procedures, community services, and Chinese Medicine Clinics cum Training and Research Centres under the HA. As of January 27, the HA has provided necessary healthcare services to around 1 900 affected residents.

Mental health support

  The 18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline immediately deployed additional staff and strengthened training for its call handlers on the day of the fire incident to cope with the emotional distress that the public may experience due to the incident. From the time of the incident to January 27, the hotline has received over 19 500 calls, about 760 of which were related to the fire incident. The WhatsApp service has handled over 900 messages, with about 50 of them concerning the fire incident. The HA's 24-hour Mental Health Direct hotline, manned by psychiatric nurses, offers professional advice and support on mental health issues to callers, including provision of risk assessments and referrals to the HA's mental health services as appropriate.

SITI visits Thailand (with photos),2026-01-28 22:42,2026-01-28 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800869.htm,"​The Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, visited Bangkok in Thailand today (January 28) to promote Hong Kong's edges and vast potential to the local innovation and technology (I&T) sector with a view to strengthening collaboration in I&T between the two places.

Professor Sun attended a dinner seminar, themed ""Building growth and resilience for the future: Hong Kong as the strategic hub for technology, innovation and investment"", co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Bangkok, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Invest Hong Kong and the Thai-Hong Kong Trade Association during which he delivered a keynote speech to the local I&T community. Professor Sun said that Hong Kong is currently moving full speed ahead in building a world-class I&T ecosystem. Thailand has made significant strides in recent years in terms of strengthening its digital infrastructure, nurturing start-ups, advancing smart manufacturing, and promoting specific sectors such as healthtech, agritech and greentech. These developments align closely with Hong Kong's strengths and lay fertile ground for deeper collaboration between the two economies.

""Hong Kong's I&T landscape is characterised by 'three major I&T parks' and 'five key R&D (research and development) institutions'. This ecosystem is designed to accelerate technological advancement, attract global talent, and strengthen the city's position as a rising international I&T hub. While embracing international co-operation through our InnoHK Platform, we welcome universities and research institutes in Thailand to join the venture.""

Professor Sun stressed that Hong Kong is the perfect destination for Thai companies that wish to connect with the Mainland Chinese market, with the official opening of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone last December.

The Chief Executive Officer of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, Mr Terry Wong, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park Limited, Mr Vincent Ma, who also joined the visit, introduced to the guests at a panel discussion the latest developments of their respective parks.

This morning, Professor Sun visited the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (DEPA) of Thailand under the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society of Thailand to understand the DEPA's strategies in promoting digital economy and innovation development, which cover digital transformation for industries and small and medium-sized enterprises, digital platform building, and supporting measures for development of digital-related industries as well as Thailand Digital Valley project. Both sides had an exchange on collaboration between the DEPA, and the Hong Kong Science Park and the Hetao Hong Kong Park.

Professor Sun also visited Charoen Pokphand Group, a Thailand-based conglomerate with a highly diversified business portfolio. He had a discussion with the Group's management to learn about its latest development and investment plans in advanced manufacturing, as well as those of the Group's telecommunication enterprise, True Corporation, in digital infrastructure, AI, cybersecurity, and retail businesses.

Professor Sun then visited the Institute for Technology and Innovation Management, Mahidol University and toured its frontier research facility. As a key innovation hub in Thailand, the institute specialises in supporting technology transformation, innovation management and research commercialisation. Both sides explored collaboration opportunities in areas including joint research, technology transfer and start-up incubation between Hong Kong and the institute.

In addition, Professor Sun met with the Federation of Thai Industries and exchanged views with the local industrial and manufacturing sectors on co-operation in new industrialisation and industrial upgrading and transformation. During the meeting, he invited Thai enterprises to leverage Hong Kong as a platform to jointly develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and international markets.

Upon his arrival in Bangkok yesterday afternoon (January 27), Professor Sun immediately met with the Thai Health Tech Association, to learn about the association's work in promoting digital health innovation. He was briefed by leading local health tech enterprises and start-ups as well as representatives of hospital organisations on their technology, product development and market planning.

Professor Sun then visited the True Digital Park of the True Corporation to learn about the Park's operation in fostering the growth of I&T enterprises and facilitating the application of technologies. The Park features modern offices, co-working spaces, innovation laboratories and event venues, offering an I&T ecosystem that brings together international and local technology enterprises, start-ups and venture capitalists.

Professor Sun also called on the Chinese Ambassador to Thailand, Mr Zhang Jianwei, to introduce the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's plans in promoting I&T, emerging industries, digital economy and more, and to exchange views on further I&T co-operation between Hong Kong and Thailand.

Professor Sun will depart for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, tomorrow (January 29) to continue the visit."

​立法會：運輸及物流局局長就「促進陸路跨境交通」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-01-28 22:33,2026-01-28 23:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800792.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上就何敬康議員動議的「促進陸路跨境交通」議案的總結發言︰

主席：

我在此感謝何敬康議員就促進陸路跨境交通動議議案，以及多位議員就議案提出修正案。我已細心聆聽並衷心感謝各位議員提出的寶貴意見。眾所周知，香港的交通網絡四通八達，運輸基建和公共交通服務更把粵港澳以高效便捷的方式緊密連繫。這不單促進本港的交通暢達性，更重要的是肩負起促進大灣區人流和物流互聯互通的使命。在此跟大家分享一些數字和里程碑：單在過去的七年，高鐵香港段、港珠澳大橋、蓮塘／香園圍口岸、香港國際機場三跑道系統等重大基建相繼啓用，把本港在空、鐵、陸的交通容量和韌性以幾何級提升。二○二五年首十個月期間，本港的公共交通總使用人次達35.4億，即每天平均約1 200萬人，高鐵香港段的使用人次達超過3 000萬；而二○二五年機場的客運量則達6 100萬人次。港珠澳大橋和高鐵香港段在開通七年以來，統計使用人次已雙雙突破一億。

運輸政策將持續着重發展運輸基建，另一方面則秉持「以人為本」的理念，進一步提升海、陸、空交通服務的質素和效率，優化乘客體驗。當中在善用科技、提效增量用好基建、做好服務更是關鍵一環。為持續強化香港內聯外通的核心優勢，帶動經濟、便利民生，我們除了強化本港的公共交通服務，尤其是鐵路網絡覆蓋和運載效率外，亦會在基建、跨境公共交通服務等方面進一步提升香港與大灣區其他城市以至全國和世界各地的交通連接。接下來，我會就大家提出的意見作重點回應。

（一）軌道交通

在高鐵服務方面，特區政府以及香港和內地的鐵路單位一直積極留意全國高鐵網絡的發展，以進一步增加高鐵香港段的直達站點，亦會適時優化高鐵服務，為旅客提供更多元的選擇和服務。例如港鐵公司於二○二三年八月和二○二四年三月分別推出往返香港西九龍站與福田站和深圳北站的「靈活行」安排，讓乘客免費改乘同日來往兩站的指定車次最多三次，為一項嶄新的票務安排，便利旅客彈性出行。「靈活行」適用的班次亦設有「無預留座位」安排，以提供較大空間和彈性讓乘客調動車次。港鐵公司亦於二○二四年一月推出來往香港西九龍站及短途站點的「30日定期票」及「20次計次票」，以進一步便利經常來往兩地的旅客。

我們知悉港鐵公司正積極與內地相關單位，密切跟進在高鐵香港段引入電子客票「當日一次有效」安排的可行性以及相關營運配套。容許乘客憑「當日一次有效」車票，按自己出行需要選擇乘坐當天任何一班同方向、同等級的列車，更加彈性選乘不同列車。我們支持港鐵，亦會促請它加緊籌備，以早日推出有關的票務安排。

為進一步加強粵港澳大灣區基礎設施互聯互通，我們與深圳當局正透過「港深跨界軌道基礎設施建設專班」攜手推進北環線支線和港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）兩個跨境鐵路項目。兩個項目預計分別於二○三四年和二○三五年通車，屆時將提供鐵路服務直達皇崗口岸、深圳灣口岸以及前海，達到全面打通港深兩地地鐵網絡的效果。規劃中的北環線東延線及新界東北線，將來亦計劃接駁至文錦渡口岸及香園圍口岸。在相關鐵路線通車後，北部都會區內有鐵路覆蓋的陸路口岸，將由現時羅湖及落馬洲支線兩個口岸大幅增加至六個，預期能更有效分流旅客使用各口岸，促進港深進一步融合發展。

（二）道路交通

就跨境私家車常規配額機制，粵港澳政府一直共同管理常規配額制度，有序增發配額以配合三地車輛互通的需求。於二○二四年，經香港各陸路口岸的跨境私家車車次已達到約950萬輛，相對二○一九年同期即僅五年前，上升了25%。為了配合需求，各跨境安排的申請和牌證機制等一直持續優化。剛才有多位議員提到「一車多關」的可行性。事實上，在跨境巴士和出租車方面，「一車多關」已於二○二三年十二月開始，讓營辦商更靈活地調配車輛使用已獲批註的口岸。至於剛才議員提到的私家車方面，從口岸運作角度來説，必須考慮對口岸通行及附近交通的影響，以及在繁忙時段可否有具體措施確保各口岸能發揮分流效果等，須仔細研究。例如，若大量兩地牌私家車集中在某個口岸過境，會否影響口岸的運作、會否出現車龍倒灌而影響口岸附近的本地交通、會否導致兩地牌私家車常規配額的使用者難以估計通關和交通所需的時間。綜合而言，我們留意到剛才議員提到一些很好的意見，包括應該積極探討本港口岸的通關能力，粵港兩地共同研討。更重要的是令市民在使用時能清楚預計和掌握每個口岸的通關情況、預計的時間，以及對於交通的影響。這是可以透過科技和系統上發放消息處理的關注事宜。特區政府一定會以社會的整體利益為依歸，亦需要粵港雙方仔細研究和評估，共同積極磋商。

至於「港車北上」，剛才亦有提到，會否考慮開放深港口岸供「港車北上」使用，以滿足現時日益增長的需求，並分散車流。同樣地，政府一直密切留意特別在尖峰時段大橋口岸現時的通關交通情況。有關部門會採取不同措施，提升香港口岸的通關能力，以應付及滿足車流增加。除了尖峰或錯峰，不同市民現時都會因應不同情況調整其出行時間，我們正密切留意。畢竟，跨境駕駛計劃實施的詳情、口岸清關的安排、運作的時間都是一些很認真的課題，需要通盤積極考慮。特區政府會持續優化「港車北上」，推動便捷的跨境通行，進一步善用大橋的承載力，促進大灣區融合發展。

至於港澳私家車常規配額方面，兩地政府會適時檢討和優化安排，包括我們將會劃出一部分新增配額，開放予所有香港永久性居民和香港註冊公司申請，以期進一步用好大橋和促進港澳之間的往來。就這方面，我理解何敬康議員提出了不少意見和關注，未來我希望在這個基礎上，共同以開放的態度探討。

大家亦非常關注「粵車南下」，我簡單向大家複述一下，香港機場管理局在大橋香港口岸人工島上的「易泊飛」服務已於十一月啓用，至今已有超過2 000車次預約使用。而入境市區部分亦在剛過去的聖誕節前通車，剛滿月已收到超過2 500輛粵車申請參加，以及破千車次的出行預約，反應正面。政府會繼續按確保安全、有效分流、完備配套和簡便申請四大策略，穩步增潤「粵車南下」安排。我們評估認為計劃將為內地旅客提供更多便捷靈活的選擇，方便他們來港參加商務會議、展覽和交流活動，從而促進大灣區內的雙邊商貿、旅遊和專業交流；從而為粵港企業合作開闢新的機會，為香港百業發掘無限機遇。此外，我也很熱切期待，透過「泊車轉機」安排，將有助於提升香港作為國際航空樞紐的地位就配套設施，我簡單和大家再交代，運輸署已推出「香港出行易」應用程式的「粵車南下」專頁，電子地圖公司例如高德地圖亦積極響應，提供高效、精準的導航服務，以及專屬資訊。

特區政府也非常重視車輛和道路安全，因此我們透過在廣東省的13個車輛查驗中心，依據香港的驗車標準，嚴格做好把關。同時，我們在確保道路安全和車輛安全之餘，必須與時並進，因此最近透過不同方面，包括車輛科技的發展——我們留意到「粵車南下」有一些新能源車輛入境，設有自動駕駛裝置，以至大家最近關注的玻璃事宜，我們希望確保能夠與時並進。我在此預告，希望能總體進行檢視，在上半年內與立法會議員分享有關建議和研究結果。

就「粵車南下」，大家亦有提及充電設施。現時全港已經有40個國標快速充電設施，以滿足不同訪港粵車快速以國標設施充電。接下來，我期望透過業界包括地產商、商場或酒店，提供更多不同充電設施，最好就是讓旅客能泊車轉乘，把車泊在酒店或商場便可享用一站式、多元充電和泊車安排。

剛才也有議員提到新皇崗口岸非專營巴士（包括旅遊巴士）以及上落客的安排，以至整體新皇崗口岸聯檢大樓港方口岸區開通時的配套措施。在這方面，一方面我們要促進本港和跨境的公共交通，同時也要考慮現場的配套措施，其本身的運作需要和硬件的配套。我們理解非專營巴士（包括旅遊巴士）一般就此都有一些訴求，我們希望能夠取得平衡。總的來說，希望在專營巴士、跨境巴士、旅遊巴士方面能做到以民為本之餘，亦能夠配合，盡用有限的空間，以提升交通運輸安排。

（三）牌證電子化和便利化

第三方面是關於跨境駕駛計劃的系統優化。粵港政府已陸續為多項跨境駕駛計劃加強車輛登記及駕駛牌照相關的系統銜接，以期便利市民和營商。例如為「港車北上」和「粵車南下」提供「一站式」的網上申請平台。我們將會爭分奪秒，盡快達致經網上進行預約申請。

（四）陸路跨境物流

剛才有議員關注陸路跨境物流。陸路跨境貨物關係到香港整體的民生、貿易發展，同時亦關乎香港整體作為國際航運中心和國際航空樞紐的重要支柱。因此，我們一向關注和會持續優化陸路跨境貨運安排，並在處理與跨境貨車有關的事宜時，緊守「保運力、保穩定」的政策原則，同時會考慮不同持份者的意見，包括業界、貨主、前線司機和企業的意見，以確保跨境陸路的貨運暢達和運力充足。我們未來亦會就粵港澳商用車駕照互認進行深入的研究，並確立三地商用車駕照互認的可行性。

我希望在此特別指出，海關在這方面做了大量工夫，尤其是利用港珠澳大橋。海關最近推出的「跨境一鎖計劃」以及「空陸鮮活產品專屬快線」等，正正體現了便利貨物互聯互通，以鞏固香港作為物流樞紐的地位。

最後，主席，我感謝今日各位議員就「促進陸路跨境交通」的議案提供多項寶貴的意見。通過把握大灣區的發展機遇，特區政府正不斷提升交通服務水平及基建設施，強化其內聯外通的樞紐地位，推動運輸系統邁向高效益和可持續的新里程。多謝主席。"
Buildings Department reminds industry to comply with new sampling and testing mechanism for scaffold nets (with photos),2026-01-28 21:54,2026-01-28 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800795.htm,"The Buildings Department (BD) today (January 28) held a seminar to remind the industry to comply with the requirements of the new sampling and testing mechanism for scaffold nets, as well as the fire safety measures that must be followed during building repair works. The BD will continue to inspect buildings undergoing major repairs, demand immediate rectification of non-compliance and pursue punitive action accordingly.

Following the promulgation of Practice Note for Registered Contractors 85 (PNRC 85) in December last year, which stipulates the new sampling testing mechanism for scaffold nets on external walls, the BD has been gradually receiving test reports and notifications of completion of scaffolding from registered contractors (including but not limited to registered contractors who procured scaffold nets through the Construction Industry Council's collective bulk procurement). To help the industry further enhance its understanding of, and compliance with, the new mechanism, the BD held a seminar this afternoon at CIC-Zero Carbon Park in Kowloon Bay.

A spokesman for the BD said, ""About 650 contractors and subcontractors of the scaffolding industry participate in the seminar in person and online. The BD takes this opportunity to brief the industry again about the new arrangements detailed in PNRC 85 and reminds the industry to strictly adhere to the testing and installation requirements set out therein. These include taking samples of scaffold nets and obtaining test reports meeting the recognised fire retardant performance standards prior to the installation of scaffold nets for carrying out of relevant works on existing buildings.""

The BD reiterated that it will vigilantly enforce the mechanism and has already launched inspections and site audits. If contractors have installed the scaffold nets without complying with the testing requirements set out in PNRC 85, or if the test results of on-site samples collected by the BD fail to meet the recognised fire retardant performance standards, the BD will order immediate cessation of works and removal of non-compliant scaffold nets under the Buildings Ordinance (BO). Reinstallation of the scaffold nets will only be permitted when test reports meeting the recognised fire retardant performance standards in accordance with PNRC 85 have been obtained. Moreover, the BD will follow up on non-compliance cases seriously, including taking appropriate punitive action.

During the seminar, the BD also reminded the industry that when carrying out building repair works, it is essential to observe and comply with the fire safety measures required by the BD and other relevant departments, such as the Fire Services Department and the Labour Department. These include maintaining fire barriers in good condition, storing combustible materials properly to avoid accumulation, and ensuring that combustible materials (such as foam boards) are not installed on external walls or windows, as these may lead to the spread of fire. Alternative measures for ensuring adequate standard of fire safety should be provided if any means of escape or fire barriers (including fire doors or fixed lights on escape staircases and protected lobbies) have to be temporarily removed/blocked.

""To ensure that construction methods do not pose fire safety risks to residents or the public, the BD has launched a special inspection operation of buildings undergoing major repairs since late last year. The inspections focus on whether fire barriers (including fire doors and fixed lights) have been removed; and whether combustible materials (such as foam boards) have been used to cover windows. As at yesterday (January 27), the BD had inspected 322 buildings and found that 13 of them had failed to comply with the relevant fire safety measures. The BD had informed the relevant registered building professionals and contractors on the spot and issued them with warning letters requiring rectification in seven days. Among them, two cases had failed to make rectification by the deadline, and two cease works orders had been issued. Depending on the situation, the BD may also consider instigating prosecution and/or disciplinary action under the BO, or referring the cases to the relevant law enforcement department for appropriate action,"" the spokesman continued."

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is my pleasure to join all of you here in Bangkok, a city that blends ancient heritage with modern dynamism. Let me begin by wishing all of you a joyful and prosperous year of 2026.

  In just a few weeks, we will welcome the Year of the Horse. In Chinese culture, the horse symbolises vitality, speed, and the courage to break new ground. These qualities resonate deeply not only with Hong Kong's innovation and technology (I&T) development, but also with Thailand's dynamic progress in digital transformation and its ambition under the Thailand 4.0 vision.

Shared Momentum: Thailand's Digital Rise and Hong Kong's I&T Transformation

  Throughout my stay in Bangkok in the past two days, I have been impressed that Thailand has made significant strides in recent years in terms of strengthening its digital infrastructure, nurturing start-ups, advancing smart manufacturing, and promoting specific sectors such as healthtech, agritech, and greentech. These developments align closely with Hong Kong's strengths and lay fertile ground for deeper collaboration between our two economies. 

A Clear Blueprint: Hong Kong's Strategic I&T Vision

  Hong Kong is currently moving full speed ahead in building a world-class I&T ecosystem. The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government published the Hong Kong I&T Development Blueprint in 2022, setting out major directions and strategies for the next five to ten years, with a clear vision to propel Hong Kong towards becoming an international I&T centre. Our focus is on industries that are strategically important to us, namely life and health technology; AI and robotics; as well as advanced manufacturing and new energy.

  To accelerate Hong Kong's development into an international I&T centre, the Hong Kong SAR Government has introduced a series of forward-looking policies and measures to enhance our I&T ecosystem. Our objective is to leverage our strengths in upstream R&D (research and development), and at the same time speed up the commercialisation of R&D outcomes in the mid-stream, and promote downstream development of industries. Of most significance are three HK$10-billion initiatives - (i) the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme which fosters transformation of R&D outcome; (ii) the New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme which provides matching funds for the setting up of smart production lines in Hong Kong; and (iii) the I&T Industry-Oriented Fund which encourages market capital to invest in strategic industries. Together, they represent a combined investment of roughly US$3.9 billion, which is around 121 billion Thai Baht, dedicated to driving I&T development in our city.

  Hong Kong's I&T landscape is characterised by ""three major I&T parks"" and ""five key R&D institutions"". This ecosystem is designed to accelerate technological advancement, attract global talent, and strengthen the city's position as a rising international I&T hub. We are also embracing international co-operation through our InnoHK Platform, which has forged partnerships with over 30 world-renowned universities and research institutes across 12 economies, establishing 30 cutting-edge research laboratories. We welcome universities and research institutes in Thailand to join us on this meaningful venture.

New Infrastructure: A Gateway Connecting Chinese Mainland and the World

  Hong Kong is the perfect destination for Thai companies that wish to connect with the Chinese Mainlandmarket. On this, I am excited to share that the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone officially opened last month. Situated right next to Shenzhen, the Hong Kong Park is envisioned to develop into a world-class hub for technological innovation that connects the Chinese Mainland with the international community. We are also delighted that the Central People's Government of China has reaffirmed its support for Hong Kong to develop into an international I&T centre in the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development.

  Indeed, over the past few years, the Hong Kong SAR Government has facilitated about 500 leading I&T enterprises or those with potential to develop, set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. This clearly demonstrates Hong Kong's strategic role as a gateway for companies and investors venturing into the Chinese Mainland and the broader Asian and Middle East markets.

Start-up Growth: A Launchpad for Global Entrepreneurs

  Today, Hong Kong stands as one of the most dynamic and fast-growing destinations for start-ups in Asia. As of 2025, our city is home to 5 200 start-ups, an impressive increase of 11 per cent compared to last year, and a rise of around 40 per cent compared to that of 2021. More than a quarter of these founders are non-locals. This speaks volumes about Hong Kong's openness, global connectivity, and strong appeal as a launchpad for ambitious entrepreneurs from around the world.

  Beyond the numbers and polices, what truly defines Hong Kong's I&T landscape is our people, our talent. Home to five of the world's top 100 universities, Hong Kong's academic excellence continues to fuel our robust R&D capability and cultivate an ever-expanding pool of I&T talent. 

  Besides, Hong Kong has long been known for its agility and entrepreneurship spirit. Our bilingual and business-friendly environment, simple tax system with low tax rate, and world-class logistics and infrastructure, all make Hong Kong a fertile ground for global tech talent and enterprises, including those from Thailand and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

Global Recognition: Hong Kong's Rising I&T Competitiveness

  Our efforts are bearing fruit, as reflected in Hong Kong's performance in various I&T-related international rankings. Notably, Hong Kong was ranked third worldwide in the ""Technology"" Factor and fourth overall in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025 published by the International Institute for Management Development. Even more encouraging, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster ranked first globally for the first time in the Global Innovation Index 2025 Ranking of World's Top 100 Innovation Clusters published by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

A Year of New Possibilities

  We warmly welcome our friends from Thailand to visit Hong Kong, discover the vibrant and exciting city first-hand, and explore new opportunities for collaboration. Whether in R&D, talent exchange, start-up development, or investment, Hong Kong stands ready to connect and grow with you.

  My thanks go to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Bangkok, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, InvestHK and the Thai-Hong Kong Trade Association, for organising this meaningful gathering. I wish everyone an enjoyable evening, good health and continued success in the coming Year of the Horse. Thank you."

We are also embracing international co-operation through our InnoHK Platform, which has forged partnerships with over 30 world-renowned universities and research institutes across 12 economies, establishing 30 cutting-edge research laboratories. We welcome universities and research institutes in Thailand to join us on this meaningful venture.

New Infrastructure: A Gateway Connecting Chinese Mainland and the World

  Hong Kong is the perfect destination for Thai companies that wish to connect with the Chinese Mainlandmarket. On this, I am excited to share that the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone officially opened last month. Situated right next to Shenzhen, the Hong Kong Park is envisioned to develop into a world-class hub for technological innovation that connects the Chinese Mainland with the international community. We are also delighted that the Central People's Government of China has reaffirmed its support for Hong Kong to develop into an international I&T centre in the 15th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development.

  Indeed, over the past few years, the Hong Kong SAR Government has facilitated about 500 leading I&T enterprises or those with potential to develop, set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. This clearly demonstrates Hong Kong's strategic role as a gateway for companies and investors venturing into the Chinese Mainland and the broader Asian and Middle East markets.

Start-up Growth: A Launchpad for Global Entrepreneurs

  Today, Hong Kong stands as one of the most dynamic and fast-growing destinations for start-ups in Asia. As of 2025, our city is home to 5 200 start-ups, an impressive increase of 11 per cent compared to last year, and a rise of around 40 per cent compared to that of 2021. More than a quarter of these founders are non-locals. This speaks volumes about Hong Kong's openness, global connectivity, and strong appeal as a launchpad for ambitious entrepreneurs from around the world.

  Beyond the numbers and polices, what truly defines Hong Kong's I&T landscape is our people, our talent. Home to five of the world's top 100 universities, Hong Kong's academic excellence continues to fuel our robust R&D capability and cultivate an ever-expanding pool of I&T talent. 

  Besides, Hong Kong has long been known for its agility and entrepreneurship spirit. Our bilingual and business-friendly environment, simple tax system with low tax rate, and world-class logistics and infrastructure, all make Hong Kong a fertile ground for global tech talent and enterprises, including those from Thailand and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

Global Recognition: Hong Kong's Rising I&T Competitiveness

  Our efforts are bearing fruit, as reflected in Hong Kong's performance in various I&T-related international rankings. Notably, Hong Kong was ranked third worldwide in the ""Technology"" Factor and fourth overall in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025 published by the International Institute for Management Development. Even more encouraging, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster ranked first globally for the first time in the Global Innovation Index 2025 Ranking of World's Top 100 Innovation Clusters published by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

A Year of New Possibilities

  We warmly welcome our friends from Thailand to visit Hong Kong, discover the vibrant and exciting city first-hand, and explore new opportunities for collaboration. Whether in R&D, talent exchange, start-up development, or investment, Hong Kong stands ready to connect and grow with you.

  My thanks go to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Bangkok, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, InvestHK and the Thai-Hong Kong Trade Association, for organising this meaningful gathering. I wish everyone an enjoyable evening, good health and continued success in the coming Year of the Horse. Thank you."

​運輸及物流局局長就強制安裝和佩戴安全帶新規定會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2026-01-28 21:03,2026-01-28 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800734.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（一月二十八日）下午就強制安裝和佩戴安全帶新規定會見傳媒的談話內容：

運輸及物流局局長：各位傳媒朋友、香港市民，我留意到有傳媒及市民對實施佩戴安全帶新規定的關注，我在此作簡單回應。首先，政府推行佩戴安全帶規定的初心及原意由始至終只有一個，就是希望保障乘客安全，而佩戴安全帶以保障乘客安全的做法在國際間常見。在香港而言，我們把現時乘客乘坐的士、公共小巴須佩戴安全帶的規定，延伸至涵蓋專營巴士及其他相關商用車輛，目的只有一個，就是安裝及佩戴安全帶能保障市民寶貴的生命，這是我們的原意及初衷。

新規定在周日（一月二十五日）開始實施，這數天大家正在適應及習慣。我們曾表示在新規定實施初時會法、理、情兼備，希望透過教育及宣傳協助市民，大家一起同行，適應安排。過往我們在的士或小巴推行相關規定時，也留意到市民反映使用時的情況，我們也很希望與大家一起適應這安排及落實好安排。

就乘客佩戴安全帶的討論其實並非新鮮事物，過去曾發生涉及專營巴士或載有學童的非專營巴士的嚴重巴士意外，大家最深刻印象的當然是在大埔發生的嚴重巴士意外，造成多人死傷。在香港而言，我們看到過去一段時間，在二○一八年前後，無論在公路或市區也曾發生嚴重巴士意外。國際研究顯示，若乘客佩戴安全帶，當車輛迎頭相撞或翻側時，能減低死亡風險四成，亦可減低重傷風險近七成。就此議題的討論醞釀多年，每當發生嚴重交通意外，社會也很關注，政府亦很重視市民的關注，所以其實是一個進程。

新規定近日實施，市民提出了不同意見，我們與巴士公司亦密切留意。一方面，我們聽到經常乘坐巴士的市民反映他們會佩戴安全帶，認為能保障他們寶貴的生命。另一方面，我們也聽到傳媒朋友提出不同情境及情況，包括安全帶是否清潔、在拉出來時的鬆緊程度、配置是否方便、使用時乘客可能要上、落車等。我們有細心聆聽，而運輸署及專營巴士公司也會一一聆聽市民回饋的意見。例如在清潔方面，我們會促請巴士公司盡快跟進及改善。其他例如在使用裝置時或拉出安全帶時是否方便、鬆緊程度等，這些涉及操作及裝置的問題，我們也很樂意及積極跟進和改善。

最後，我想重申，我們明白整體而言市民需要時間適應新規定，因此，在適應期內，我們在推行及執法方面會法、理、情兼備，希望人性化處理，亦會以勸喻為主。同時，我期望並已要求運輸署及專營巴士公司接下來要加強對乘客的宣傳及教育，包括如何協助長者及其他乘客的需要等，要多做宣傳教育工作。在此，我很樂意向各位傳媒朋友及市民表示，保障市民安全是政府的初心，我們願意與市民同行，攜手盡快適應及習慣新規定，務求可全方位提升乘坐專營巴士或其他商用車輛的安全性，加強保障乘客安全。

記者：局長，剛才提到現時社會對於佩戴安全帶的規例有很多迴響，有否考慮暫緩相關措施？有市民指罰則過高，有否考慮調整罰則？第二個問題關於有研究指巴士的企位比座位更危險，有否考慮取消巴士的企位？

運輸及物流局局長：首先，九成香港市民均利用公共交通出行，而當中乘坐專營巴士的為數不少。如大家曾乘坐巴士應知道，香港有跨區的長途巴士路線，亦有一些市區的短途路線，部分會途經高速路段，不同情況皆有。當然大家會提出，譬如有些車廂內設有企位，若要裝置安全帶，可以如何理順這些情況呢？大家都看到安全帶可以保障乘客的安全，因此我們盡量以保障更多市民的安全為上。

因應目前實際環境，屬於集體運輸的專營巴士除了座位，亦設有企位。佩戴安全帶是加強保障乘客安全的其中一個方法。巴士公司已在站立位置加設防滑地面，亦有提供防滑和加長的扶手。最重要的是，香港過往多次經歷嚴重的巴士意外，每次我們聚焦這個課題，有哪些方面能夠加強保障的，我們都盡量做。巴士的相關硬件設備和裝置，以及其限速系統，能提升和鞏固巴士的穩定性，減少翻側的情況，是一套整全的配套措施。政府、專營巴士公司和公共交通工具特別是專營巴士的乘客需要共同努力，保障自身安全，以防範再有類似的嚴重巴士意外發生。

記者：就大埔二○一八年巴士車禍的調查報告，當中沒有建議要強制立法懲罰沒有佩戴安全帶的乘客，甚至運輸署當年亦有引述一些文件稱不宜強制。另外，外地有不少地方已豁免短途或有企位的巴士強制佩戴安全帶，如果立法是因應當年的報告和外地例子，這個說法會否有誤導？另外，立法之前並沒有進行公眾諮詢，會否覺得太倉促、諮詢不足？

運輸及物流局局長：首先，就加強商用車輛包括專營巴士的乘客安全，是一個經多年討論和醞釀的題目。傳媒朋友都看到，過去有很多嚴重巴士意外仍歷歷在目，除了大埔二○一八年的嚴重巴士意外，二○○九年在將軍澳亦有巴士轉彎時翻側，早於一九九八年在灣仔的天橋亦有巴士在轉彎時翻側。二○二一年，一輛載有學童的非專營巴士在大涌橋路發生意外翻側，當時正正是因為學童佩戴了安全帶，因此全數在車上的學童都可幸地只受輕傷。由此可見，佩戴安全帶作為加強保障乘客自身安全的其中一個方法的討論並非新事物，而是經醞釀和討論多年，而每次意外發生後，社會都關注和期望政府盡快落實有關措施。

第二，我留意到社會上有市民就要求坐在有配置安全帶的座位的乘客佩戴安全帶的規定反映意見，當然我們明白有些車輛會途經公路或者市區，亦設有企位，但整體而言，我們一定要盡量加強保障每一位乘客的安全，這是我們的目標和前提，要朝着這個目標進發。市民反映他們可能坐着、站立或準備上落車時面對一些不便或不適應的情況，我們會多聽意見，就裝置、清潔情況、使用時的便利程度等，盡量並盡快跟進和改善，以助市民適應。

記者：剛才提到會檢討裝置，有議員提議不如和小巴一樣，轉為繫於腰間的兩點式安全帶，可更方便乘客，局方會否考慮？

運輸及物流局局長：我認為最重要的前提是車輛有安裝安全帶，而市民亦會佩戴，這樣就可真正達到保障專營巴士乘客安全的最大目標。至於安全帶的設計、裝置和操作，包括清潔程度、使用時如何確保有最大保障而又能便民等個別情況，我們聽到議員提出的意見，希望推行和實施一段時間後再不時檢視如何盡量改善和優化。我認為這些都是很好的意見和回饋，我們會就這方面多做教育和宣傳，接下來透過巴士公司，希望和不同乘客多些直接溝通，我們很樂意多聽意見。多謝大家。"

Michael (Council Chairman of City University of Hong Kong, Professor Michael Ngai), Professor Lee (Provost and Deputy President of City University of Hong Kong, Professor Lee Chun-sing), Dr and Mrs Banga (Founding Patrons of the Indra and Harry Banga Gallery, Dr Harry Banga and Mrs Indra Banga), Alvin (Director of the Indra and Harry Banga Gallery, Professor Alvin Yip), curators and exhibiting professors, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is a pleasure to join you for the opening of the ""Prototyping: 創新演煉"" Exhibition and to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Indra and Harry Banga Gallery. Please allow me to extend my warm congratulations to the City University of Hong Kong on this remarkable occasion.

I had the pleasure of visiting the exhibition just now. It vividly illustrates how technologies developed in Hong Kong can be translated into real-world applications, and how artists and scientists can co-create works that engage a broader audience. This spirit of enterprise and collaboration is precisely what Hong Kong needs to strengthen both our arts and innovation ecosystems, and to nurture the next generation of versatile talent.

Over the past decade, the Banga Gallery has become a flagship venue of the City University and a pioneer in cross-disciplinary exhibitions. It plays a vital role in promoting cultural heritage and fostering dialogue among diverse cultures and civilisations. As a platform for innovative experimentation, the Gallery serves as a living laboratory where new ideas are explored, refined, and shared. Its exhibitions have inspired practitioners across the region and contributed to the ongoing development of Hong Kong's cultural institutions and ecosystem.

As our community looks to new pathways to generate economic value, the Gallery's experience serves as a good point of reference. Consumers nowadays increasingly seek novel, personalised experiences, placing greater emphasis on emotional connection and meaning. The intersection of art and technology offers valuable insights into how innovative products and services can be developed, ones that resonate with the public and create new markets.

That is why the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is committed to advancing the development of arts, culture, and the creative industries. We see this not only as a means to cultivate new economic drivers, but also as a powerful way to enhance Hong Kong's global appeal, enrich the cultural life of our community, and reinforce our unique role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

On innovation and technology (I&T), our ambition is equally clear: we are fully committed to promoting I&T, injecting fresh momentum into our economy, and creating high-quality career opportunities for our people. Talent is the cornerstone of this endeavour. We must continue to promote science and technology across society, and ignite a passion for innovation and discovery-especially among our young people.

In this regard, the Gallery's work is both meaningful and impactful. It demonstrates how cross-sector collaboration can expand horizons, foster community connections, and inspire the next generation of talent.

In closing, allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Gallery, the Banga family, and all patrons for your generous support and the good work done.

I wish the exhibition every success. And as the Year of the Horse is drawing near, taking this opportunity I wish you good health, happiness and blessings in the Year of the Horse. Thank you."

"Hong Kong highlighted as ""super-connector"" at 12th Transpacific Entrepreneurial Conference",2026-01-28 20:00,2026-01-28 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012700694.htm,"The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (Toronto) (Toronto ETO) reaffirmed Hong Kong's unique role as a global business gateway at the 12th Transpacific Entrepreneurial Conference, held on January 28 (Hong Kong time).

The Conference, themed ""TransPacific Economic Diversification: New Investment Opportunities"", was held in a hybrid format connecting Hong Kong, Canada, and Asia, bringing together entrepreneurs, investors, and business leaders to explore emerging trade and investment prospects between Asia and Canada. The annual Conference is a signature initiative of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, jointly presented with the Hong Kong-Canada Business Association and supported by Toronto ETO and Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK).

In his opening speech, the Director of the Toronto ETO, Mr Bill Wong, described Hong Kong as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"", highlighting the city's distinct advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. These include its highly internationalised business environment, world-class professional services, common law system aligned with international practices, and simple and competitive tax regime, all of which position Hong Kong as a natural bridge between the Chinese Mainland and global markets.

Mr Wong noted that, despite global trade challenges, during the first 11 months of 2025, Hong Kong's exports and imports of goods both grew by over 14 per cent. Hong Kong also reclaimed its position as the world's leading initial public offering venue, raising approximately US$35 billion, contributing to a year of economic growth expected to reach 3.2 per cent.

He also pointed out that Hong Kong's competitiveness continues to receive strong international recognition. In 2025, Hong Kong was ranked the world's freest economy by the Canadian-based Fraser Institute, third globally in terms of competitiveness, as well as among the global financial centres.

Looking ahead, Mr Wong highlighted initiatives announced in the latest Policy Address to further strengthen Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"". These include the establishment of a new task force to support Mainland enterprises in expanding overseas through Hong Kong and the launch of the ""Economic and Trade Express"" platform, which brings together the efforts of the overseas Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices, InvestHK and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to assist overseas companies in accessing Asian and Chinese Mainland markets via Hong Kong.

As Hong Kong will help create more opportunities for businesses, he encouraged Canadian and international entrepreneurs to leverage the strengths of Hong Kong as a dynamic platform for growth, innovation, and transpacific economic diversification.

The 12th Transpacific Entrepreneurial Conference included six panel discussions with over 30 speakers from leading companies in different sectors. The Deputy Head of Investment Promotion of InvestHK Toronto Office, Ms Grace Lau, shared insights at the panel themed ""Diversified Entrepreneurs - New Investment Opportunities""."

王國彪亦指出，儘管全球貿易面對挑戰，香港二○二五年首十一個月的貨物進出口均錄得超過14%的增長。香港亦重奪全球首次公開招股（IPO）集資額最高的市場地位，集資約350億美元，帶動二○二五年經濟增長預計達3.2%。

他續稱，香港的競爭力持續獲得國際高度肯定。於二○二五年，香港獲加拿大菲沙研究所評為全球最自由經濟體；在世界競爭力及多個環球金融中心指數亦位列全球三甲。

展望未來，王國彪強調最近發表的《施政報告》提出多項措施，進一步鞏固香港「超級聯繫人」的角色，包括成立新專責小組，協助內地企業透過香港「走出去」，以及推出「經貿一站通」功能平台，整合香港駐海外經濟貿易辦事處、投資推廣署及香港貿易發展局的力量，協助海外企業以香港作為進入亞洲及中國內地市場的市場。

香港能為商界創造更多機會，他鼓勵加拿大及國際企業家把握香港作為促進增長、創新及跨太平洋多元化經濟動力平台的優勢。

第十二屆跨太平洋企業家會議共有六個專題討論，逾30位來自不同界別的頂尖企業講者參與其中。投資推廣署多倫多辦事處投資推廣副總監劉慧恩亦在題為「多元化企業家 — 嶄新投資機遇」的專題討論上分享真知灼見。"
立法會：保安局副局長就「促進陸路跨境交通」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-01-28 19:56,2026-01-28 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800708.htm,"​以下是保安局副局長卓孝業今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議就何敬康議員動議的「促進陸路跨境交通」議案的總結發言：

主席：

我非常感謝何議員的議案，六位議員的修正案，以及各位議員就議案提出的寶貴意見。我在此就陸路口岸運作情況，以及提升陸路口岸通關效率的措施作簡要總結，並說明政府的後續工作方向。

在粵港澳大灣區發展藍圖下，粵港市民跨境往來日益頻繁。去年，在運作中的八個陸路口岸總出入境人次約2.8億，較二○二四年增加約13%，當中，內地訪客人次約3 300萬，較二○二四年增加約12%。

與此同時，跨境私家車及貨運車流量亦穩步上升。

面對持續增長的通關需求，特區政府一直與澳門、內地相關市政府及部委緊密合作，透過前瞻性規劃和持續協調，從靈活調配人手、善用資訊科技及完善口岸設施等多個方面提升陸路口岸的整體通關能力，便利粵港兩地居民雙向奔赴。

在口岸運作及管理方面，口岸部門透過多管齊下的措施，確保過關人流及車流暢順有序。為應對節假日期間的跨境需求，口岸部門已建立成熟的跨部門協作機制。由警務處、入境事務處（入境處）及香港海關等組成的跨部門聯合指揮中心會在節假期期間運作，實時監察各口岸的人流及車流情況，並按需要迅速調整人手部署，加開臨時櫃枱及車輛檢查通道。此外，粵港澳三地已建立口岸熱線及即時通報機制，就車流、人流及突發情況保持密切聯繫，以便各方作出相關部署。

在科技應用方面，特區政府持續引入創新科技提升通關效率及管理水平。香港海關去年第四季在羅湖口岸和落馬洲支線口岸引入影像分析系統，提升旅客清關效率和執法成效。入境處亦計劃於今年第二季在港珠澳大橋香港口岸設立全港首個「無感通關」試點，讓合資格市民透過人面辨識科技核實身分，實現不停頓過關。

去年九月，保安局亦推出一個一站式「口岸通」資訊平台，提供各口岸實時旅客、私家車及過境穿梭巴士的輪候時間，以協助市民規劃行程。下一階段，平台將引入AI（人工智能）評估，提升準確度。

展望未來，提升陸路口岸基礎建設應對持續增長的旅客流量至為重要，其中，港深兩地正全力推進皇崗口岸和沙頭角口岸的重建項目。重建後的皇崗口岸將會實施「一地兩檢」安排及嶄新的「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式。至於沙頭角口岸則會採用「跨河建」的安排重建，並實施「合作查驗、一次放行」。我們於去年十二月完成港方的工程可行性研究，並就收回土地建議刊憲。政府會繼續與深圳市政府緊密合作，積極推進重建項目，為跨境旅客帶來更大便利。

我們亦有留意議員對通關時間的意見。陸路口岸的開放時間由港深兩地政府協商，並須獲得中央批准。延長通關時間涉及兩地口岸運作，須審慎考慮一籃子因素，包括實際需要、兩地資源的有效運用、人手安排及相關口岸的交通配套等。在現行落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋口岸提供24小時旅客出入境清關服務基礎上，我們會密切留意旅客通關需要，視乎實際需要適時與內地有關當局協商延長個別口岸的旅檢通關服務時間。兩地政府亦會因應節假日通關需求，協商特別通關安排，便利兩地人民往來。

最後，我再次感謝各位議員在辯論中提出許多寶貴意見，保安局會認真研究，並與相關政策局及部門通力合作，透過靈活調配資源、科技應用、跨部門協作及粵港協同，持續完善陸路口岸通關能力、便捷度及旅客體驗感，促進香港與其他粵港澳大灣區城市的互聯互通。多謝主席。"
Import of poultry meat and products from areas in Hungary and Japan suspended,2026-01-28 19:56,2026-01-28 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800539.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (January 28) that in view of a notification from the Ministry of Agriculture of Hungary about an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Békés County in Hungary, and a notification from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan about an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza in Chiba Prefecture in Japan, the CFS has instructed the trade to suspend the import of poultry meat and products (including poultry eggs) from the above-mentioned areas with immediate effect to protect public health in Hong Kong.

A CFS spokesman said that Hong Kong has currently established a protocol with Hungary for the import of poultry meat but not for poultry eggs. According to the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong imported about 110 tonnes of frozen poultry meat from Hungary, and about 1 540 tonnes of frozen poultry meat and about 219.73 million poultry eggs from Japan in the first nine months of last year.

""The CFS has contacted the Hungarian and Japanese authorities over the issues and will closely monitor information issued by the World Organisation for Animal Health and the relevant authorities on the avian influenza outbreaks. Appropriate action will be taken in response to the development of the situation,"" the spokesman said."

屋宇署提醒業界遵守棚網抽樣檢測新制度（附圖）,2026-01-28 19:33,2026-01-28 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800678.htm,"​屋宇署今日（一月二十八日）舉辦講座，提醒業界須遵守棚網抽樣檢測新制度的要求，以及大廈維修工程進行期間須遵從的消防安全事項。屋宇署會繼續巡查大型維修工程的樓宇，發現違規行為會即時要求糾正並作出懲處。

自去年十二月公布《註冊承建商作業備考》85（《作業備考》85），訂明外牆棚網抽樣檢測新制度，署方陸續收到註冊承建商呈交的棚網檢測報告及棚網上架通知（當中包括但不限於透過建造業議會集體採購棚網的註冊承建商）。為進一步協助業界加強了解及遵從新制度，屋宇署今日下午在九龍灣建造業零碳天地舉行講座。

屋宇署發言人表示：「計及線上線下出席情況，約650名承建商和棚業分判商出席講座。署方藉此再次向業界講解《作業備考》85中詳列的新制度安排，並提醒業界必須嚴格遵從《作業備考》85所載的檢測及上架要求，包括在現存樓宇進行相關工程前，必須先按要求抽取棚網樣本並取得符合認可阻燃效能標準的測試報告後，方可將棚網上架。」

署方重申會嚴格執行有關制度，並表示已開始進行巡查和抽驗工作，如發現承建商未有遵從《作業備考》85所載的檢測要求便把棚網上架，又或署方對於已上架棚網進行現場抽取樣本的測試結果未能達到認可阻燃標準，署方將根據《建築物條例》命令即時停工及拆除不符合標準的棚網，待根據《作業備考》85取得符合認可阻燃效能標準的測試報告後才可以再次鋪設棚網。另外，署方會嚴肅跟進違規事件，包括採取適切的懲處行動。

屋宇署在講座中亦提醒業界在進行樓宇維修工程時，必須留意及遵從署方以及其他相關部門如消防處和勞工處要求的消防安全預防措施，包括妥善保養防火屏障；妥善貯存易燃物料及避免囤積；可燃物料（例如發泡膠板）因有機會令火勢蔓延，不得鋪設於外牆及窗戶；必須就暫時阻隔或更換逃生途徑的防火屏障（包括逃生樓梯及防護門廊的防火門或防火固定窗）提供符合消防安全標準的替代措施等。

發言人續表示：「為確保工程的施工方式不會對住戶或公眾構成消防安全風險，屋宇署自去年底就進行大型維修工程的樓宇展開特別巡查行動，例如防火屏障（包括防火門及防火固定窗）有否被拆除、有否用可燃物料（例如發泡膠板）鋪設於窗戶等。截至昨日（一月二十七日），屋宇署共巡查了322幢樓宇，發現其中13幢樓宇沒有遵從相關消防安全預防措施，已即場通知相關註冊建築專業人士及註冊承建商並發出警告信，要求於七日內糾正，其中兩宗個案欠妥情況在期限內仍未獲糾正，署方已發出停工令，並考慮根據《建築物條例》提出檢控及／或採取紀律處分，或轉介相關執法部門採取懲處行動。」"
LCQ14: Handling scaffolding on external walls of buildings left unremoved for prolonged periods,2026-01-28 19:11,2026-01-28 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800623.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Vincent Cheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (January 28):

Question:

The fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po has aroused public concern regarding the safety hazards posed by some scaffolding on the external walls of residential buildings which has been left unremoved for prolonged periods. Furthermore, it has been reported that the owners' corporation (OC) of a tenement building had a dispute with the building maintenance works consultant and contractor, resulting in the external wall scaffolding remaining erected for as long as two years. The Buildings Department (BD) has noted the potential risks posed by the scaffolding, and issued orders requiring its removal. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Government earlier on issued orders requiring relevant contractors to remove scaffold nets on the external walls of buildings undergoing maintenance across Hong Kong, of the number of buildings involved in such orders, with a breakdown by the 18‍ districts across the territory; whether it has compiled statistics on how long the scaffolding of such buildings has been erected; if so, of the number of those which have been erected for more than two years;

(2) whether the relevant government departments currently require OCs or management companies of buildings which need to erect scaffolding for maintenance to declare information such as the duration for which the external wall scaffolding remains erected and the expected removal date; if so, of the number of external wall scaffoldings which have remained erected for more than two years without being removed, with a breakdown by the 18 districts across the territory; if not, whether the authorities will consider requiring relevant persons to submit such information;

(3) given that according to the information provided in the authorities' reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025-2026, as of 2024, among the Category 1 and Category 2 buildings covered by ""Operation Building Bright 2.0"", the percentages of those having completed the prescribed repair works were only 12.6 per cent and 35.6 per cent respectively, whether the Government has examined how many of the buildings which have not yet completed the repair works currently still have external wall scaffolding erected, with a breakdown by Category 1 and Category 2 buildings;

(4) whether it has ascertained the reasons for the delayed removal of scaffolding that has been erected on the external walls of buildings for prolonged periods; if so, of the details; regarding those buildings with scaffolding that cannot be removed due to delay in maintenance works, whether the Government will provide appropriate assistance to OCs and property owners that have difficulties, so that they can expedite the completion of the works and the removal of scaffolding;

(5) of the circumstances where the BD will serve orders on OCs or property owners requiring the removal of scaffolding on the external walls of buildings; of the number of the relevant orders issued by the BD over the past five years and the number of instances in compliance with such orders; how the Government will deal with parties that fail to comply with such orders (including those OCs and property owners that cannot afford the removal costs); and

(6) of the number of cases where the BD removed the scaffolding on the external walls of buildings on behalf of property owners or OCs over the past five years; among such cases, of the number of cases where the Government successfully recovered the removal costs from the relevant property owners or OCs?

Reply:

President,

Our reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Government announced on December 3, 2025 that for all buildings undergoing major repair works with scaffolding nets installed on their external walls, such nets must be removed and works on the external walls be ceased. After the Buildings Department (BD) required net removal and issued the relevant orders to cease works, scaffolding nets of a total of 230 private buildings were removed. The breakdown by District Council (DC) district is tabulated below:

  ​Currently, temporary scaffolding erected for carrying out works does not require approval from the BD. Therefore, the BD does not maintain statistics on the duration of scaffoldings erected. Generally speaking, scaffolding should be removed upon completion of works involving external walls. According to the records received by the BD on commencement of works, it is believed that among the aforementioned 230 buildings, only six buildings had scaffoldings erected for more than two years, which were located in Central and Western, Eastern, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun and Wan Chai districts.

(3) As at the end of 2025, the ratio of Category 1 buildings and Category 2 buildings under the ""Operation Building Bright 2.0"" as mentioned in the question with repair works completed (Note 1) rose to 13.2 per cent (277 buildings) and 40 per cent (892 buildings) respectively. The remaining 1 822 Category 1 buildings and 1 354 Category 2 buildings are at different stages of building inspection or building works. According to the information available to the BD in November last year, only 46 Category 1 buildings and 236 Category 2 buildings among those buildings had scaffolding erected on their external walls.

(4) Scaffolding should be removed upon completion of works involving external walls and generally should not remain erected for years. The actual timing for scaffolding removal is subject to various factors, such as changes in the scale and scope of works, or other unforeseen circumstances (such as inclement weather), which may lead to delay in scaffolding removal. Moreover, contractual issues related to the works, such as disputes over works progress or costs, may also lead to delay in scaffolding removal.

The Development Bureau, in collaboration with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, is partnering with relevant statutory bodies and professional organisations to provide professional advice to Owners' Corporations and owners in need on building maintenance matters, such as issues related to works contracts and tendering, as well as property and facility management, through preparation of information packages, district seminars and more.

(5) and (6) If scaffolding erected on the exterior of a private building is found to be dangerous or likely to become dangerous, the BD may issue an order under section 26 of the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123) requiring owner to remove the scaffolding. Based on experience, this mostly involves weather conditions that render scaffolding unsafe.

If the owner fails to remove scaffolding within the specified time frame, the BD may consider applying the provisions of the BO to carry out works specified in the order. Upon completion of works, the BD will recover relevant costs of the works, supervision charges, and surcharges from the owner. If the owner fails to make payment within the specified period after the BD issues an invoice, the BD will issue a certificate of arrears and register it at the Land Registry, constituting a first charge on the premises. Interests of the outstanding amount will be calculated at 10 per cent per annum to protect the Government's right to recover the costs. For owners who fail to comply with order without reasonable excuse, the BD will consider taking prosecution action.

The numbers of orders issued by the BD concerning scaffolding, orders complied with, and default works completed in the past five years are tabulated below:

Note 1: There are two categories of buildings under the ""Operation Building Bright 2.0"" (OBB 2.0). Category 1 buildings are those with owners who are prepared to take up the organisation of inspection and repair works for their buildings under the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS). Owners of eligible buildings may apply to the Urban Renewal Authority within the specified time frame. Category 2 buildings are those with outstanding MBIS notices and the owners concerned have difficulties in co-ordinating the requisite inspection and repair works. The BD proactively selects Category 2 buildings on a risk basis (i.e. not upon application by owners) and exercises its statutory power to carry out the requisite inspection and repair works in default of owners, and seeks to recover the cost from owners concerned afterwards. Eligible owners of Category 2 buildings may claim subsidies under the OBB 2.0 to cover all or part of such cost.

Note 2: The number of orders complied with or the number of completed default works does not necessarily correspond to the orders issued in the same year.

For cases with default works completed, the BD is currently following up on the recovery of the relevant costs."
​立法會十四題：處理樓宇外牆長期未拆的棚架,2026-01-28 19:11,2026-01-28 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800620.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

大埔宏福苑火災引起市民關注部分長期未拆的住宅樓宇外牆棚架的安全隱患。此外，據報有唐樓的業主立案法團（法團）與大廈維修工程顧問及承建商發生糾紛，導致外牆棚架維持搭建長達兩年，屋宇署指該棚架有潛在風險並發出命令要求拆除。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府早前發出命令，要求相關承建商拆除全港正進行維修的樓宇外牆棚網，該命令所涉及的樓宇數目為何，並按全港18區列出分項數字；有否統計，該等樓宇的棚架已搭建多久；如有，當中有多少已搭建逾兩年；

（二）現時相關政府部門有否要求須搭建棚架以進行維修的大廈法團或管理公司，申報外牆棚架維持搭建的時間，以及預計拆除日期等資料；如有，有多少個外牆棚架已維持搭建逾兩年而仍未拆除，並按全港18區列出分項數字；如否，當局會否考慮要求相關人士提交有關資料；

（三）鑑於根據當局回覆本會議員就二○二五至二○二六財政年度開支預算的問題時所提供的資料，截至二○二四年，「樓宇更新大行動2.0」所涵蓋的第一類別和第二類別樓宇中，已完成訂明修葺工程的百分比分別僅有12.6%和35.6%，政府有否檢視，有多少幢未完成修葺工程的樓宇現時仍有外牆棚架搭建，並按第一和第二類別樓宇列出分項數字；

（四）有否了解該等搭建已久的大廈外牆棚架遲遲未有拆除的原因；如有，詳情為何；對該等因維修工程延誤而未能拆除棚架的大廈，政府會否向有困難的法團和業主提供適切支援，以令其可加快完成工程及清拆棚架；

（五）屋宇署在甚麼情況下會向法團或業主發出命令，要求拆除大廈外牆棚架；過去五年，該署發出相關命令的數目，以及該等命令獲遵辦的數目為何；對於未有遵辦命令的人士（包括該等無力支付清拆費用的法團及業主），政府會如何處理；及

（六）過去五年，屋宇署代業主或法團拆除大廈外牆棚架的個案數目為何；當中政府成功向相關業主或法團追回清拆費用的數目為何？

答覆：

主席：

就提問的各部分，現分別回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府於二○二五年十二月三日宣布，所有正進行大型維修工程的樓宇，如果外牆設有棚網，須將棚網下架並停止外牆工程。屋宇署發出下架和相關的停工令後，共230幢私人樓宇的外牆棚網已經移除，按區議會分區分布表列如下：

現時，為進行工程而豎設的臨時棚架並不需要屋宇署審批。因此，屋宇署並無備存棚架搭建時間的統計數字。一般而言，棚架理應於完成涉及外牆的工程後便可清拆。根據屋宇署收到的工程展開通知書紀錄，上述230幢樓宇相信只有六幢樓宇的棚架搭建超逾兩年，分布於中西區、東區、深水埗、屯門及灣仔區。

（三）截至二○二五年底，問題提及的「樓宇更新大行動2.0」第一類別和第二類別已完成修葺工程的樓宇（註一）比例已分別升至13.2%（277幢）及40%（892幢）。其餘的1 822幢第一類別樓宇和1 354幢第二類別樓宇正處於不同的驗樓或工程階段。根據屋宇署去年十一月底所掌握的情況，當中有46幢第一類別樓宇和236幢第二類別樓宇的外牆有搭建棚架。

（四）棚架理應於完成涉及外牆的工程後便可清拆，一般不應搭建多年。拆除棚架的實際時間受多種因素影響，例如工程規模和範圍改動，或其他不可預見的因素（例如惡劣天氣），因而需要延遲清拆棚架時間。另外，如涉及工程合約問題，例如工程進度及費用爭議，亦有可能會導致棚架延遲清拆。

發展局正聯同民政及青年事務局夥拍相關法定機構和專業組織，籌備透過資訊包和地區講座等形式，為有需要的業主立案法團及業主提供大廈維修相關的專業意見，例如工程合約與招標、物業及設施管理等方面相關的事宜。

（五）及（六）若發現在私人樓宇外部所搭建的棚架變得危險或可能變得危險，屋宇署可根據《建築物條例》（第123章）第26條發出命令，着業主拆除該棚架。根據經驗，這情況大多涉及天氣狀況導致棚架變得危險。

如業主未能於指定時限拆除該棚架，屋宇署可考慮根據《建築物條例》的規定，由署方代辦命令所指明的工程，並會於完工後向業主收回相關工程費用、監督費及附加費。若屋宇署在發出繳款單後，有關業主未有如期付款，屋宇署會發出欠帳證明書，並將其在土地註冊處註冊，構成該處所的第一押記，而未償還款項利息會以年率10厘計算，以保障政府追討費用的權益。對未有遵從命令而又沒有合理辯解的業主，屋宇署會考慮採取檢控行動。

過去五年，屋宇署就棚架發出命令、獲遵辦的命令及完成代辦工程的數目表列如下：

註一：「樓宇更新大行動2.0」（「2.0行動」）涵蓋兩類樓宇。第一類別樓宇為該些業主有意根據強制驗樓計劃自行為其樓宇籌組檢驗及修葺工程的樓宇，合資格樓宇的業主可於指定期限內向市區重建局提出申請。第二類別樓宇則為仍未遵辦強制驗樓通知、而相關業主在統籌所需的檢驗及修葺工程上有困難。屋宇署會按風險主動挑選第二類別樓宇（即非由業主提出申請），行使其法定權力代業主進行所需的檢驗及修葺工程，並於事後向業主追討有關費用。第二類別樓宇的合資格業主可申領「2.0行動」的津貼，抵償工程涉及的全數或部分費用。

註二：命令遵辦數目或完成代辦工程數目並不一定涉及同年發出的命令。

就已完成代辦工程的個案，屋宇署正在跟進收回相關費用的工作。"
​香港海關檢獲懷疑受管制屬瀕危物種活龜及仙人掌（附圖）,2026-01-28 18:58,2026-01-28 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800648.htm,"香港海關昨日（一月二十七日）在深圳灣管制站檢獲兩隻和四株懷疑受管制屬瀕危物種的活龜及仙人掌，估計共值約二千元。

立法會︰發展局局長就「優化白石角交通網絡及社區設施」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-01-28 18:55,2026-01-28 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800667.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上就「優化白石角交通網絡及社區設施」議員議案的總結發言全文：

主席：

多謝各位議員的意見，剛才廖副局長（運輸及物流局副局長廖振新）為我們解說了白石角站的技術挑戰和附近未來的交通配套優化安排。接下來，我只想補充幾點。

現時白石角是大埔區的一部分。剛才很多議員都提到區內欠缺配套設施，但正因為白石角是大埔區的一部分，我們規劃設施時難免會以大埔區整區為基礎。現時區內主要社區及康樂活動設施主要集中在大埔市中心，現時有八個社區會堂或社區中心，亦設有圖書館、體育中心、游泳池等。不過我們理解這些設施對白石角居民而言，需要區內有交通配套才能方便前往，所以我們希望藉着推展白石角綜合發展項目時，盡量在計劃內增加有利民生的社區配套。

我希望今日的發言讓社會和議員明白，政府推出白石角綜合發展項目研究，其政策目標並無改變，而且是多個政策目標混於一體，包括希望借助增加一個鐵路站，更好提升科學園的地位和更好服務當區的工作及居住人口。第二，我們希望更好地服務教育大學的學生和提升教育大學作為教育樞紐一部分的吸引力。第三，藉着釋放土地，也讓我們有機會借助公私營合作，為剛才我提到的好設施提供財務支撐。有這麼多政策目標，自然對成本有壓力，包括我提及過我們不但要建新車站，還要考慮車站建成後如何增設行人連接設施，讓出行市民能從這個車站跨過吐露港公路到達科學園和附近的民居。

另外，我們搬遷運動中心、為新的運動場徵地，也因為有新人口遷入而要提升基建設施等等。我聽到有議員問政府是否「計唔掂數」，其實我仍然相信「有志者，事竟成」，但始終要「計數」。所以我今日亦提出，我們現正探討除了在教大運動場遷置後的用地上發展住宅和其他配套，亦可能要探討在區域外另外增加土地，希望增加整個項目的可持續性及財務可行性，所以其實都需要有一些拆牆鬆綁。

今天的議案辯論，我們聽取了很多寶貴的意見。我們往後在總結這個發展項目的建議方案前，一定會多加考慮。但在剛才的發言，我也聽到很多議員表示應盡量加入多些各類型的公共設施。然而這些設施越多，恐怕自然會對整個項目的財務可行性再增加壓力。我們未必可以全數將議員剛才建議的所有公共設施一一實現，但會研究在資源許可的情況下將一些與民生息息相關的設施納入項目內。

現時這個研究已進入最後關鍵階段，我們主要正在進行細化成本分析的工作，以及因應成本分析，一定要在區內和區外找到足夠的發展土地去支撐，起碼減低政府在這方面的成本壓力，因為真的希望社會和議員都明白，政府現時有很多土地發展項目，特別是北部都會區項目，都在全速推進中。可能在第一季完成這些分析會有難度，不過我們都會盡力在今年盡快公布發展建議。

屆時我們期待和在座各位議員合作，在地區做好解說工作，讓市民明白我們不但要車站、不但要搬遷教大運動場，亦需要在財務可以支撐的情況下進行這些工作，為社會帶來裨益。多謝主席。"
立法會十六題：醫療保健產品的推廣,2026-01-28 18:45,2026-01-28 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800586.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上林琳議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據報近年市面上出現不少不同類型的醫療保健器械或產品，而部分該等器械或產品使用了由本地初創企業及大學科研團隊所研發的創新技術。然而，有醫學專業界別人士反映，該等器械或產品的效用未有足夠獨立臨床研究數據及其他醫學數據的支持。有意見認為，該等器械或產品以聲稱具備特定醫學用途作宣傳，可能令公眾（尤其長者）誤解其實際效用，難以保障消費者的權益與安全。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）對於市面上出現越來越多結合創新技術、聲稱具有保健作用的器械或設備，在該等產品進行廣泛推廣前，政府有何機制評估及確認其採用技術的安全性，以及其聲稱效果是否具備科學實證；

（二）鑑於現時《不良廣告（醫藥）條例》（第231章）（《條例》）規管有關「藥物、外科用具或療法」的廣告，使用新研發的創新技術的醫療保健器械或產品是否受《條例》規管；如是，就該等器械或產品在其宣傳中含有預防、改善或緩解疾病的表述時，當局如何判斷相關宣傳有否違反《條例》，以及有何監察措施以識別並跟進違規的宣傳；如否，當局會否考慮檢視現行相關法例以加強規管該等器械或產品；

（三）過去五年，違反《條例》中有關「禁止或限制發布的廣告所涉及的疾病及病理情況」相關規定的個案宗數、相關判罰，以及所涉廣告內容分別為何；及

（四）為同時鼓勵創新與保障公眾健康，政府會否採用更具前瞻性的規管機制（例如為研發具有改善健康功效的器械或產品的科研團隊提供早期法規諮詢，以免該等產品違反相關條例），以及加強公眾教育，提醒市民應更審慎評估聲稱具有保健效用的新興器械或產品的功效？

答覆：

主席：

就林琳議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局和衞生署後，現回覆如下：

香港銳意成為國際醫療創新樞紐，以制度創新配合科技創新，推動生物醫藥技術新質生產力，加快病人獲得先進診療。政府正加快改革藥物器械審批制度，提升藥械的監管水平，並積極推動創新醫藥械研發成果轉化。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》宣布，政府會於二○二六年內成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」（中心），並向立法會提交藥物及醫療器械監督管理條例草案，有序整合西藥、中藥和醫療器械的監管職能，務求令中心盡快成為國際認可的藥械權威監管機構，推動本港發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐。醫務衞生局和衞生署亦正推進有關規管醫療器械的立法準備工作，因應近年國際間最新規管趨勢，全面檢討擬議規管架構，將於年內向立法會提交立法建議。

規管醫療器械

香港現時尚未訂立專門法例規管醫療器械，惟視乎有關產品的特性和特點，一些產品已受現行法例規管，如《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章）、《消費品安全條例》（第456章）及《商品說明條例》（第362章）。正如上述，政府計劃於年內就規管醫療器械向立法會提交立法建議，完善規管架構。

為保障公眾健康，衞生署自二○○四年起參考全球協調醫療器械規管專責小組（現為國際醫療器械監管機構論壇）的建議，設立自願性的「醫療器械行政管理制度」，透過審批表列醫療器械，以確保符合其安全、品質和性能的相關標準，並推行貿易商的制度和產品推出市場後的監察系統。即使未有法定規管，目前已有超過8 900項醫療器械在表列制度下表列。創新醫療器械必須通過科學實證包括臨床試驗，提供可靠數據以確定其安全性及效能，市民若因有需要使用醫療器械，在臨床應用之前應徵詢醫生等醫護專業人員以作判斷。

規管醫藥相關的廣告

針對創新技術的醫療保健器械或產品所發布的廣告，同樣受到《不良廣告（醫藥）條例》（《條例》）（第231章）規管。為避免市民尋求不當方法治理某些病況，現時《條例》禁止／限制任何人發布相當可能導致他人以預防或治療《條例》內附表1及2所訂明的疾病或病理情況（註一），而使用任何藥物、外科用具或療法的廣告。《條例》亦禁止／限制口服產品於廣告內作出附表4所指明的六類聲稱（註二）。

衞生署按機制審查醫藥相關廣告，包括當中的整體內容及個別字眼，如發現其內容涉嫌違反《條例》規定，會依法處理。二○二一年至二○二五年期間，衞生署合共審閲了超過20萬條在本港不同媒體發布的廣告，包括報紙、雜誌、宣傳單張、招牌、海報，以及電台、電視和互聯網上的廣告等。針對個別個案情況，衞生署會按機制發出警告或啓動起訴程序。在上述年份，衞生署已就違反《條例》的廣告發出超過2 200封警告信，在發出警告信後涉嫌違反《條例》的相關廣告內容已被移走或刪除。對於接獲警告信後仍不移走或刪除相關廣告內容的個案，衞生署會按機制啓動起訴程序。違例者首次定罪可被判罰款50,000元及監禁六個月；就同一條所訂的罪行再被定罪，則可處罰款100,000元及監禁一年。

政府會繼續密切留意其他地方的規管措施及本地的市面情況，適時檢視《條例》以更有效規管包括醫療保健器械或產品在內的醫藥廣告。

註一：附表1及2所訂明的疾病或病理情況，如心臟或心血管系統疾病、肌與骨骼系統疾病。

註二：附表4所指明的聲稱，如調節體內糖分或葡萄糖及／或改變胰臟機能，調節血脂或膽固醇。"
LCQ16: Marketing of medical and health products,2026-01-28 18:45,2026-01-28 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800579.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Nixie Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (January 28):

Question:

  It has been reported that in recent years, many different types of medical and health devices or products have emerged in the market, of which some have employed innovative technologies developed by local start-ups and university research teams. However, some members of the medical profession have relayed that the efficacy of such devices or products is not sufficiently supported by independent clinical research and other medical data. There are views that the promotions of such devices or products claiming to serve specific medical purposes may lead to misunderstanding among the public (especially the elderly) about their actual efficacy, rendering it difficult to protect the rights and interests as well as safety of consumers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) regarding the increasing number of devices or equipment incorporating innovative technologies and claiming beneficial health effects emerging in the market, of the mechanism put in place by the Government to assess and verify the safety of the technologies employed, as well as whether the claimed effects are supported by scientific evidence, prior to extensive marketing of such products;

(2) given that the existing Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap. 231) (the Ordinance) regulates advertisements relating to ""medicine, surgical appliance or treatment"", whether medical and health devices or products employing newly developed innovative technologies are regulated by the Ordinance; if so, regarding such devices or products containing promotional statements about the prevention, improvement or alleviation of diseases, how the authorities determine whether such promotions have contravened the Ordinance, and of the monitoring measures in place to identify and follow up on non-compliant promotions; if not, whether the authorities will consider reviewing the existing relevant legislation to step up the regulation of such devices or products;

(3) of the number of cases in which the requirements relating to ""diseases and conditions in respect of which advertisements are prohibited or restricted"" under the Ordinance were contravened in the past five years, the relevant penalties imposed, and the contents of such advertisements; and

(4) to encourage innovations while safeguarding public health, whether the Government will adopt a more forward-looking regulatory mechanism (e.g. providing early legal advice to research teams developing health-promoting devices or products to prevent such products from contravening the relevant ordinances), and step up public education to remind members of the public to exercise greater caution in evaluating the efficacy of emerging devices or products claiming beneficial health effects?

Reply:

President,

  The reply, in consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Department of Health (DH), to the question raised by the Hon Nixie Lam is as follows:

  Hong Kong is committed to developing into an international health and medical innovation hub, where technological innovation is complemented by institutional innovation, fostering new quality productive forces in biomedical technology and expediting patients' access to advanced diagnostic and treatment services. The Government is expediting the reform of the approval mechanism for drugs and medical devices to raise regulatory standards and spearhead the translation of research findings on innovative drugs and medical devices into practical applications.

  The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address announced that the Government will set up the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) in 2026 and submit the Medical Products Regulation Bill to the Legislative Council, in order to systematically consolidate the regulatory functions for Western and Chinese medicines as well as medical devices. The objective is to establish the CMPR as an internationally recognised regulatory authority for medical products as soon as possible and foster the development of Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. The Health Bureau and the DH are making preparations for legislating medical device regulation. A comprehensive review of the proposed regulatory framework is being conducted, having regard to international regulatory trends in recent years. A legislative proposal will be submitted to the Legislative Council this year.

Regulation of medical devices

  While there is no specific legislation to regulate medical devices in Hong Kong, some products are regulated by existing pieces of legislation, such as the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance (Cap. 456) and the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap. 362), depending on the characteristics and features of the products concerned. As mentioned above, it is the Government's plan to introduce a legislative proposal on regulating medical devices to the Legislative Council this year to improve the regulatory framework.

  To safeguard public health, the DH introduced a voluntary Medical Device Administrative Control System (MDACS) in 2004, drawing on recommendations from the Global Harmonization Task Force (now known as the International Medical Device Regulators Forum). The system involves approving a list of medical devices to ensure their compliance with relevant safety, quality and performance standards, establishing a trader listing system, and implementing a post-market monitoring system for products. Although there is currently no statutory regulation in place, more than 8 900 medical devices have already been listed under the MDACS. Innovative medical devices must undergo scientific validation, including clinical trials, to provide reliable data demonstrating their safety and efficacy. Members of the public in need should consult healthcare professionals such as medical practitioners before clinical use of medical devices.

Regulation on medical advertisements

  Advertisements for innovative medical and health appliances or products are also subject to the regulation under the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Ordinance) (Cap. 231). To prevent the public from seeking improper management of certain health conditions, the Ordinance prohibits/restricts the publication of advertisements that will likely lead to the use of any medicine, surgical appliance or treatment for the purpose of preventing or treating diseases or conditions (note 1) specified in Schedules 1 and 2 to the Ordinance. The Ordinance also prohibits/restricts orally consumed products to make six groups of claims (note 2) specified in Schedule 4 in advertisements.

  The DH screens medical advertisements, including the overall content and individual wording, based on its established mechanism. Appropriate actions will be taken in accordance with the law against any contravention of the Ordinance. From 2021 to 2025, the DH reviewed over 200 000 advertisements published across various media in Hong Kong, including newspapers, magazines, leaflets, signs, posters, as well as radio, television and internet advertisements. Depending on the circumstances of individual cases, the DH will issue warnings or initiate prosecution proceedings based on its established mechanisms. During the aforementioned years, the DH issued over 2 200 warning letters concerning advertisements that contravene the Ordinance. After the issuance of warning letters, relevant advertisement contents suspected of contravening the Ordinance were removed or deleted. For cases where the relevant advertisement content is still not removed or deleted upon receipt of warning letters, the DH will initiate the prosecution proceedings based on its established mechanism. Upon first conviction, an offender is liable to a fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months; for subsequent convictions for an offence under the same provision, an offender is liable to a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor the regulatory measures in other jurisdictions as well as the local market situation, and will review the Ordinance as appropriate to strengthen the regulation of medical advertisements, including those relating to medical and health appliances or products.

Note 1: Diseases or conditions specified in Schedules 1 and 2, such as diseases of the heart or cardiovascular system and diseases of the musculo-skeletal system.

Note 2: Claims specified in Schedule 4, such as regulation of body sugar or glucose and/or alteration of the function of the pancreas and regulation of blood lipids or cholesterol."
DH follows up seriously on case of suspected unauthorised access to medical records,2026-01-28 18:30,2026-01-28 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800601.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) announced today (January 28) that a Dental House Officer (DHO) under non-civil service terms is suspected of unauthorised access to others' medical records. The DH has referred the case to law enforcement agencies for a criminal investigation. If any improper conduct and unlawful acts are substantiated, the DH will seriously follow up according to established procedures.

​The DH earlier received an enquiry from a member of the public referred by the Electronic Health Record Registration Office, who was concerned about the reason for receiving an SMS notification about his electronic health records (eHRs) being accessed by the DH healthcare officer despite his not having used the DH's services recently. The DH immediately initiated an investigation and preliminarily discovered that a DHO under non-civil service terms had repeatedly accessed the medical records of individuals without their consentthrough the clinical information management system of the school dental clinic and eHealth, involving 16 individuals who were not the DHO's patients. The DHO concerned claimed that the 16 individuals were known to the DHO.

The DH has reported the case to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, the Commissioner for Electronic Health Record and the Dental Council of Hong Kong, and has notified the affected individuals. The Dental House Officer concerned has been suspended from duty.

According to the Dentists Registration Ordinance (Cap. 156), local dental graduates are required to undergo an internship before obtaining full registration in Hong Kong. The introduction of the internship aims to strengthen the clinical experience of local dental graduates in real-life settings, through which they will become familiar with the dental practice in Hong Kong and hone their communication skills with patients. This ensures that, in addition to mastering professional knowledge, they also develop sound practical skills and a professional attitude, enabling them to exercise clinical judgements in different situations and meet the demands of the dental practice effectively.

During the two-week orientation programme for the DHOs, the DH has clearly explained the professional conduct and code of practice to which they must strictly adhere. Additionally, the regular professional development programmes organised by the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) for the DHOs during the internship have covered the professional responsibility and ethical conduct a dentist should possess, as well as the relevant provisions of legislation on safeguarding patients' personal information. In response to this incident, the Faculty of Dentistry of the HKU will strengthen the training of the dental students and dental interns on the aspects of information technology (IT) security.

To prevent similar incidents from reoccurring, the DH will review and optimise the existing internal system security measures. All staff and healthcare personnel have been reminded to strictly observe the DH's internal guidelines on IT security and the use of eHealth by healthcare personnel to ensure that they fully understand the importance of safeguarding patients' personal information.

According to the DH's stipulated internal guidelines, healthcare personnel must pay attention to protecting patients' privacy and comply with relevant laws and regulations, including the Electronic Health System Ordinance (Cap 625). At the same time, healthcare personnel must obtain consent from the patients and adhere to the principles of ""Need to Know"" and ""Patient Under Care"" when accessing patients' medical records through any of the DH's clinical information management systems and eHealth. The relevant guidelines are consistent with the Code of Practice promulgated by the eHealth. Healthcare personnel are required to carefully review these internal guidelines before applying for an eHealth account and to sign the application form confirming their understanding and commitment to comply with the relevant requirements. In addition, all the electronic health records accessed through eHealth are tracked for verification to prevent abuse.

The DH has attached great importance to the conduct and integrity of its staff (including contract staff) and has an established mechanism to regulate staff conduct and discipline. If an employee is suspected of misconduct, the DH will conduct a thorough investigation and handle all cases impartially."
立法會十二題：加強物業維修及消防安全的管理,2026-01-28 18:20,2026-01-28 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800562.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上葛珮帆議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，鑑於大埔宏福苑於維修工程期間發生五級火警，政府應明確釐清物業管理公司或業主立案法團（法團）在樓宇大型修葺工程（大維修）中的角色、善用科技協助排查和檢討，以及優化樓宇消防安全的管理。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否檢視物業管理公司或法團在樓宇大維修各階段（包括前期招標、施工過程及完工驗收）的權責劃分，並研究可否在大廈公契內訂明，物業管理公司須在大維修的不同階段提供涉及樓宇管理範疇的意見，供持份者參考；

（二）會否參考內地經驗，設立建設工程監理制度，並由屋宇署委聘一名獨立監督，負責大維修的監督工作（包括審閱維修顧問報告、維修建議、物料建議、維修標書內容及標書分析報告等），並協調工程項目各相關持份者的角色，以杜絕圍標及提升工程的監管能力、安全及效能；

（三）據悉宏福苑火災中出現火警鐘不響、消防喉沒有水，以及樓宇消防門經常不關閉的情況，當局會否善用科技，在樓宇規劃中，強制採用智慧消防與安全科技標準，包括設立物聯網火警偵測系統並在公共關鍵點安裝聯網傳感器，以在異常情況時即時傳送警報至物業管理公司和住戶手機；增設智能自動滅火裝置；及利用建築信息模擬技術進行火災模擬與疏散分析以優化布局等；

（四）據悉國家在宏福苑火災發生後，要求全國部署開展高層建築重大火災風險隱患排查整治行動，政府會否參考內地經驗，檢視全港樓宇的消防隱患，以及全面善用科技優化樓宇滅火設計，並配合教育及廣泛宣傳，提升市民大眾的防火安全意識；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（五）會否參考澳門的《分層建築物共同部分的管理法律制度》，研究立法或在大廈公契規定，大廈必須設立共同儲備基金，以承擔非預見性的開支，以及其他保養樓宇共同部分而產生的必要開支；

（六）會否善用政府的空間數據共享平台建立一個高精密度的宏福苑可視化三維數碼地圖模型，並整合相關數據，以深度調查與檢討火災事故（例如模擬重演、成因分析與檢視制度等）；及

（七）會否以地理區塊鏈科技建立物業大維修全流程資訊管理平台，以區塊鏈技術協助監察使用的建築物料是否合乎標準和追蹤其採購來源，平台也可記錄與樓宇大維修項目相關的資料（包括法團會議紀錄、業主會議紀錄、所有投標公司的背景資料、中標公司的盡職審查和整個施工流程等），實現不可篡改的全鏈透明追蹤，從而有效降低人為造假風險並提升行業質素？

答覆：

主席：

樓宇安全是宜居城市的基石，亦是政府高度重視的課題。大埔火災事件突顯了樓宇維修工程管理、嚴遵消防安全規定以及提升樓宇管理的重要性。政府相關部門正積極檢視如何進一步完善物業管理及工程監督的權責與規管架構，以及應用科技以提升樓宇維修和消防安全。

就提問的各部分，經諮詢民政及青年事務局及保安局後，現分別回覆如下：

（一）私有財產權不僅賦予權利，亦附帶樓宇管理和維修的責任。業主共同擁有私人大廈公用部分的同時，亦須共同承擔相關部分的管理和維修責任。《建築物管理條例》（《建管條例》）旨在提供一個法律框架，讓業主透過成立業主立案法團（法團），以具獨立法律地位的法人團體形式，代表全體業主執行大廈管理事務。其中，根據《建管條例》第16條，當法團成立後，業主對公用部分的各項權利與責任，均由法團行使和履行。換言之，法團在法律上有責任妥善管理和維修大廈的公用部分，包括進行有關樓宇大維修的工程。

與此同時，在物業維修過程中，持牌物業管理（物管）公司須按與業主／法團簽訂的合約，參與工程項目的協調溝通等工作。此外，物業管理業監管局（物監局）已根據《物業管理服務條例》（《物管條例》）發出《處理物業建築工程》操守守則（守則），以及相關的「良好作業指南」，以協助物管公司專業而有效地處理建築工程。其中，守則訂明物管公司的一般角色及責任，例如在工程進行前在物業的顯眼地方張貼通告，通知業主及相關人士有關工程的詳情、於工程進行期間作出適當監察及記錄、於工程完成後作適當清理並妥善修復因工程引致損毀的設施等。

如物監局有合理原因懷疑持牌人沒有遵守守則行事，可對其展開調查。調查完成後，如確認存在違紀行為，物監局可進行聆訊，並根據《物管條例》作出處分，包括口頭警告或書面譴責、罰款、對牌照施加條件、更改牌照的條件、暫時吊銷牌照或撤銷牌照等。

（二）目前樓宇維修工程大多為二級小型工程，只須聘用承建商進行工程。因應大埔火災事件，政府正進一步檢視《建築物條例》，建議將大型樓宇維修工程升格為一級小型工程，日後除了要聘請承建商，還須聘用第三方專業人士，提交訂明圖則和預防措施，以及監工計劃書，並由該名獨立於承建商的專業人士協助業主監工。屋宇署會加強抽查和執法，如發現未按圖則和計劃書進行工程，會作出懲處。

另一方面，發展局聯同巿區重建局（市建局）自二○一六年引入「招標妥」服務，由獨立顧問就大型樓宇維修工程為業主就工程範疇是否符合強制驗樓計劃要求提供獨立第三方的專業意見，以及工程項目參考價格等。經檢視後，政府會加強巿建局的「招標妥」服務，包括制定更嚴謹的顧問及承建商「預審名單」，除考慮技術和人手要求、犯罪和紀律處分紀錄，亦會考慮更多反映表現的指標，顧問和承建商亦須通過警方和廉政公署的背景審查，才能納入名單並參與投標，制度亦會引入除名安排和定期檢視名單。此外，市建局會為參加「招標妥」平台的業主進行招標和評標工作，如果有關業主申領政府的樓宇維修資助，作為資助條件，須接受市建局決定的顧問和承建商；至於其他沒有申領政府維修資助的大廈，市建局亦會向業主提供中標建議。就申領政府維修資助的大廈，工程開展後，市建局會要求顧問和承建商在重要工程節點，例如大幅修改工程範圍或增加工程費用等，向市建局報告，以便市建局向業主給予獨立意見。

政府正與巿建局就上述改革方向的細節進行商討，相信將可吸引具質素的顧問和承建商參與樓宇維修工程，同時減低顧問、承建商和個別業主之間可能作出非法串連的機會，整體推動建築業界健康發展。

（三）消防處於去年底引進「物聯網火警偵測系統」先導計劃以提升舊式樓宇消防安全水平，目前，在港島、九龍及新界區的十幢六層或以下舊式樓宇安裝「物聯網火警偵測系統」，並讓有關樓宇免卻裝設消防喉轆、消防水缸和水泵等消防裝置，進一步協助目標樓宇業主以更便捷及安全的方式遵從消防安全指示。

「物聯網火警偵測系統」具備實時監察及迅速傳輸火警訊號的功能，當偵測到火警時，會即時通知消防處通訊中心，讓消防處在火警最初期即使未有人報警的情況下，仍能第一時間調派消防車輛處理火警事故。此外，物聯網系統具備監控系統狀態的功能，當個別偵測器損壞時，系統會即時發出訊號通知消防處及服務供應商作出跟進行動。物聯網系統也會收集火警數據，有助消防處利用大數據分析相關風險因素。

消防處正持續評估先導計劃的成效，預計於今年第二季完成首階段評估。如果效果理想，會考慮讓「物聯網火警偵測系統」在所有相關樓宇應用。

另外，消防處積極鼓勵市民使用獨立式火警偵測器等設備，以增強初期火災的預警與自救能力。近年，市場出現具備智能聯動功能的獨立式火警偵測器，可與家庭監控鏡頭及智能手機應用程式相互連接，當偵測器發出火警訊號時，用戶不僅能即時收到警報通知，更可透過遠程監控畫面即時查看家中實際狀況，從而迅速判斷火勢情形，並採取最合適的應對措施。消防處會持續透過社交平台短片和社區講座等，向公眾推廣智能消防設備。

在建築信息模擬技術（BIM）的應用方面，消防處積極配合政府推動BIM在建造業的應用，並研究開發專用的BIM平台，善用自動核查等功能審批建築圖則中的消防裝置及設備，從而提升審批效率。

消防處亦會研究結合BIM 資料庫與物聯網設備以實時監測消防系統的可行性，並將持續研究相關技術以強化建築物的防火與逃生設計。

（四）在宏福苑大火後，政府已經即時成立了「強化消防安全治理工作組」，推行包括巡查執法、科技應用和宣傳教育等方面的即時措施及中長期方案，以提升消防安全水平。

在巡查及執法方面，消防處的專責巡查隊已於今年一月十三日完成首階段對256幢正在進行大維修的樓宇的消防裝置和設備的排查。另外，消防處全天候快速應變小隊去年十二月成立以來已出動183次，對火警現場的消防裝置和設備進行即時核查與執法。此外，消防處正展開為期兩個月行動，排查約1 500幢較高風險樓宇的火警警報系統。

在科技應用方面，消防處會繼續積極關注各種高科技消防裝備的最新趨勢，適時引入技術成熟及安全可行的相關裝備，以提升滅火及救援效能。

宣傳和教育方面，消防處持續透過報章專訪，新聞稿及短片等不同形式的宣傳渠道，以及舉辦各式活動，向市民宣傳基本的消防安全知識。消防處亦為市民提供更多基礎消防安全訓練，並委任他們成為消防處社區應急先鋒。此外，消防處剛在應急先鋒計劃下增設樓宇應急先鋒，專門為物管人員、法團代表和住戶提供有關樓宇消防安全的訓練，例如消防裝置及設備的正確使用方法、管理和保養責任；進行消防巡查時應注意的事項等。這些樓宇應急先鋒可協助辨識屋苑範圍内是否出現安全隱患，並參與消防巡查及向消防處或物管公司報告風險。另一方面，在地區層面，政府加強18區地區防火委員會在防火推廣、宣傳、巡查及統籌方面的角色。

（五）現行《建管條例》第20條規定，法團必須設立並維持一項常用基金，以支付法團按《建管條例》及公契規定行使權力或執行職責的費用，以及大廈日常的一般支出。此外，法團亦可設立備用基金，以應付緊急情況或常用基金不足時的需要。業主就這兩項基金所需繳付的金額，由業主按大廈的需要而釐定。

隨着越來越多大廈樓齡漸長，為確保其結構安全，相關大廈需要進行不同規模的維修工程。為減輕業主在面對維修時所承受的財政壓力，社會上有建議設立強制維修儲備基金，以便提前為未來維修作好資金準備。由於此建議涉及大廈維修及保養事宜、業主的承受力及意願等，政府各相關部門會進行研究並聽取各持份者意見。

（六）政府於二○二五年十一月二十八日就大埔宏福苑發生的火災成立了由消防處牽頭的跨部門調查專組。調查專組正調查火警起因及火警蔓延的原因，在過程中會審視所有相關證據並善用一切可行科技協助調查工作。

（七）政府對透過科技加強監察建築物料標準或追蹤建築物料持開放態度。以棚網為例，屋宇署於二○二五年十二月十九日發出作業備考，以確保鋪設於外牆棚架的防護物料符合阻燃效能標準，當中要求註冊承建商應採用可靠系統（如二維碼、近距離無線通訊裝置、射頻識別等技術），以便查核及追蹤物料批次。根據作業備考的要求，建造業議會在早前提供特事特辦的集體採購阻燃保護網安排時，使用區塊鏈技術確保採購流程透明，從建立訂單、匯報生產進度、實驗所測試、物流運送到收貨簽署，系統會將每個關鍵節點的數據寫入區塊鏈，形成清晰而不可更改的責任軌跡，防止日後被更改或造假，為業界作出良好示範。由於工程涉及的物料多元多樣，屋宇署會按風險為本的原則，審視現行機制下尚有哪類建築物料需進行加強監管物料標準或追蹤。

另外，《建管條例》對保存文件訂有明確要求，而於二○二五年七月生效的《2024年建築物管理（修訂）條例》進一步就未有妥善保存會計帳目、會議紀錄、招標文件及委任代表文書的行為引入刑事責任，至於保存文件的形式則可由法團管委會決定。"
LCQ12: Enhancing management of property maintenance and fire safety,2026-01-28 18:20,2026-01-28 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800564.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Elizabeth Quat and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (January 28):

Question:

There are views that in light of the outbreak of a No.5 alarm fire during maintenance works at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the Government should clearly define the respective roles of property management companies (PMCs) and owners' corporations (OCs) in major building repair works (overhauls), leverage technology to assist in inspection and review, and improve the management of building fire safety. In this regard, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will review the delineation of the respective powers and responsibilities of PMCs or OCs at various building overhaul stages, including early-stage tendering, construction, and completion inspection, and study the feasibility of stipulating in deeds of mutual covenant that PMCs shall provide advice on building management for stakeholders' reference at different overhaul stages;

(2) whether it will, drawing on the Mainland's experience, establish a Construction Project Management System under which the Buildings Department appoints an independent supervisor responsible for oversight of overhauls (including examination of maintenance consultants' reports, maintenance recommendations, material recommendations, maintenance tender details, and tender analysis reports) and co-ordinate the roles of all relevant stakeholders in works projects, so as to eradicate bid-rigging and enhance regulatory oversight, safety and efficiency of projects;

(3) as it is learnt that during the fire disaster at Wang Fuk Court, fire alarms did not go off, fire hydrants were not supplied with water, and fire doors in the buildings were found to be often left open, whether the authorities will leverage technology in building planning by mandating the adoption of intelligent firefighting and safety technology standards, including establishment of Internet of Things fire detection systems and installation of online sensors at critical public locations to instantly transmit alerts to PMCs and residents' mobile phones in the event of abnormal situations; addition of intelligent automatic fire extinguishing devices; and utilisation of Building Information Modelling technology to conduct fire simulations and evacuation analyses for improvement of layouts;

(4) as it is learnt that following the outbreak of the Wang Fuk Court fire, the country mandated nationwide deployment to launch an inspection and rectification campaign targeting major fire risks and hazards in high-rise buildings, whether the Government will, by drawing on the Mainland's experience, examine fire hazards in all buildings across the territory, and comprehensively leverage technology to improve building firefighting designs, while working in parallel to raise public awareness of fire safety through education and extensive publicity; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) whether it will consider, by drawing reference from Macao's Legal Regime for the Administration of the Common Parts of the Condominium, studying the enactment of legislation or stipulation in deeds of mutual covenant requiring buildings to establish a common reserve fund to cover unforeseen expenditures and other necessary expenses arising from the maintenance of their common parts;

(6) whether it will leverage its Common Spatial Data Infrastructure to create a high-precision 3D digital Visualisation Map model of Wang Fuk Court and integrate relevant data for an in-depth investigation and review of the fire incident, such as through simulated re-enactment, cause analysis and system review; and

(7) whether it will establish a whole-process information management platform based on geoblockchain technology for property overhaul projects, and make use of blockchain technology to assist in monitoring standards compliance of the construction materials in use and tracing their procurement sources, while the platform can also record information relevant to the building overhaul projects, including records of OCs' and owners' meetings, background information of all bidding companies, due diligence on successful bidding companies and the entire construction process, so as to realise immutable, transparent whole-chain traceability, thereby effectively reducing the risk of human falsification and enhancing industry quality?

Reply:

President,

Building safety is the foundation of a liveable city and a subject to which the Government attaches great importance. The fire incident in Tai Po has highlighted the importance of management of building maintenance works, strict compliance with fire safety requirements, and the enhancement of building management. Relevant Government departments are actively reviewing how to further clarify the responsibility and improve the regulatory framework regarding property management and works supervision, as well as the application of technology to enhance building maintenance and fire safety.

Having consulted the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the Security Bureau, the replies to the various parts of the question are as follows:

(1) Private property rights not only confer entitlements but also entail responsibilities for management and maintenance. When owners jointly own the common areas of private buildings, they must collectively undertake the management and maintenance responsibilities for these areas. The Building Management Ordinance (BMO) aims to provide a legal framework that allows owners to perform building management duties on behalf of all owners by establishing an owners' corporation (OC) as an independent legal entity. Specifically, under section 16 of the BMO, after the establishment of an OC, all rights and responsibilities of the owners regarding the common parts of the building are exercised and fulfilled by the OC. In other words, the OC is legally obligated to properly manage and maintain the common areas of the building, including major repair works related to the building.

Meanwhile, during the repair process of properties, licensed property management companies (PMCs) have to participate in co-ordinating and communicating for the project in accordance with the contracts signed with owners or the OC. In addition, the Property Management Services Authority (PMSA) has issued the Code of Conduct on ""Handling Building Works"" (the Code) and relevant Best Practice Guide under the Property Management Services Ordinance (PMSO) to assist PMCs in handling building works in a professional and effective manner. Among other things, the Code stipulates the general roles and responsibilities of PMCs, such as posting notices in prominent areas of the property before the commencement of works to inform owners and relevant parties about the details of the works, conducting appropriate monitoring and record-keeping during the works period, and carrying out proper clear-up after completion and adequately restoring damaged facilities due to the works.

If the PMSA has reasonable grounds to suspect that a licensee has failed to comply with the Code, it may initiate an investigation. Upon completion of the investigation and if a disciplinary offence is confirmed, the PMSA may conduct a hearing and impose penalties according to the PMSO, including verbal warnings or written reprimands, fines, imposing or varying a condition of the licence, temporarily suspending the licence, or revoking the licence.

(2) At present, most building maintenance works are designated as Class II minor works, for which only the appointment of a contractor is required for carrying out the works. In response to the fire incident in Tai Po, the Government is further reviewing the Buildings Ordinance with a proposal to upgrade major building maintenance works to Class I minor works. In the future, apart from appointing a contractor, it will also be necessary to appoint a third-party building professional to submit prescribed plans, precautionary measures, and supervision plans. This building professional, who must be independent of the contractor, will assist the owners in supervising the works. The Buildings Department (BD) will step up audit checks and enforcement action. Penalties will be imposed if works are found not to be carried out in accordance with the submitted plans.

On the other hand, the Development Bureau, in collaboration with the Urban Renewal Authority (URA), introduced the ""Smart Tender"" service in 2016. Independent consultants would provide owners with independent third-party professional advice on major building maintenance works, covering areas such as whether the scope of works compiles with the requirements of the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme and the reference prices for the works projects, etc. Upon review, the Government will strengthen the URA's ""Smart Tender"" service, including the formulation of a more rigorous ""pre-qualified list"" of consultants and contractors. In addition to considering technical and manpower requirements as well as records of criminal convictions and disciplinary actions, more indicators reflecting performance will be taken into account. Consultants and contractors must also pass background checks by the Police and the Independent Commission Against Corruption before they can be included in the list and participate in tendering. Delisting arrangements and regular reviews of the list will also be introduced. Furthermore, the URA will conduct the tendering and tender assessment work for owners participating in the ""Smart Tender"" platform. If the owners concerned have applied for Government subsidies for building maintenance, they must accept the consultants and contractors determined by the URA as a condition for the subsidies. As for other buildings that have not applied for Government maintenance subsidies, the URA will also provide recommendations on the successful bidder to the owners. For buildings applying for Government maintenance subsidies, after the commencement of works, the URA will require consultants and contractors to report to the URA at critical project junctures, such as significant amendments to the scope of works or increases in project costs, so that the URA may offer independent advice to the owners.

The Government is currently discussing the details of the above reform directions with the URA. It is believed that the above will attract quality consultants and contractors to participate in building maintenance works, while reducing opportunities for illicit collusion among consultants, contractors and individual owners, thereby promoting the healthy development of the construction industry as a whole.

(3) The Fire Services Department (FSD) introduced the Pilot Scheme on the Internet of Things Fire Detection System (IoT FDS) at the end of 2025 with the objective of enhancing fire safety standards in old buildings. At present, the IoT FDS is being installed in ten old buildings of six storeys or less across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. This allows the buildings concerned to be exempted from the installation of fire service equipment such as fire hose reels, fire water tanks, and water pumps, further assisting owners of the target buildings to comply with Fire Safety Directions in a more convenient and safe manner.

The IoT FDS offers real-time monitoring and rapid transmission of fire alarm signals. Upon detection of a fire, the system will instantly alert the Fire Services Communications Centre to handle the incident, enabling the prompt dispatch of fire appliances at the incipient stage of a fire, even in circumstances where no report has yet been made by the public. Moreover, the IoT FDS incorporates a system status monitoring function. If an individual detector malfunctions, the system will instantly transmit a signal to notify the FSD and the service provider to initiate follow-up actions. In addition, the system collects fire-related data to support the FSD's application of big data analytics in assessing relevant risk factors.

The FSD is conducting ongoing evaluations of the effectiveness of the Pilot Scheme. The first phase of assessment is expected for completion in the second quarter of 2026. Subject to satisfactory results, consideration will be given to extending the IoT FDS to all relevant buildings.

In parallel, the FSD actively promotes the use of standalone fire detectors to strengthen warning during the incipient stage of a fire and self-rescue capabilities among the public. In recent years, the market has seen the introduction of smart standalone fire detectors with interconnectivity functions, enabling integration with home surveillance cameras and smartphone applications. When the detector emits a fire alarm signal, users will not only receive instant alert notification but can also view live footage of the home's actual conditions via remote monitoring, thereby facilitating rapid assessment of the fire situation and enabling the most appropriate response. The FSD will continue to promote smart fire safety equipment to the public through short videos on social media and community seminars.

With regard to the application of Building Information Modelling (BIM), the FSD is fully aligned with the Government's initiative to promote the wider adoption of BIM within the construction industry. The department is examining the development of a dedicated BIM platform to leverage functions such as automated checking for reviewing fire service installations and equipment in building plans, thereby improving the efficiency of the approval process.

The FSD will also examine the feasibility of integrating BIM databases with IoT devices to enable real-time monitoring of fire services systems. Research efforts on related technologies will continue to strengthen fire prevention measures and evacuation design in buildings.

(4) Following the fire at Wang Fuk Court, the Government immediately established the Task Force on Strengthening Fire Safety Governance to implement both immediate measures and medium-to-long-term initiatives in inspection and enforcement, technology application, publicity and education, with the aim of enhancing fire safety standards.

For inspection and enforcement, the FSD's dedicated inspection team completed the first phase of inspections on fire service installations and equipment (FSIs) in 256 buildings undergoing major repair works on January 13 this year. In addition, since its establishment in December last year, the FSD's round-the-clock Quick Response Team has been deployed 183 times to conduct immediate on-site inspections and enforcement of FSIs at fire scenes. Furthermore, the FSD has launched a two-month operation to inspect the fire alarm systems of approximately 1 500 higher-risk buildings.

For technology application, the FSD will continue to closely monitor the latest trends in advanced fire service equipment and will, in a timely manner, introduce technologies that are proven to be mature and safe, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of firefighting and rescue operations.

For publicity and education, the FSD will continue to promote basic fire safety knowledge to the public through various channels, including newspaper interviews, press releases, short videos, and a wide range of activities. The FSD also provides additional basic fire safety training to members of the public and appoints them as FSD Community Emergency Responders. Furthermore, under the Community Emergency Responder Scheme, the FSD has newly established the Building Emergency Responders which provides specialised training for property management personnel, representatives of OCs, and residents on building fire safety, such as the correct usage, management, and maintenance responsibilities of FSIs, as well as key considerations when conducting fire inspections. These Building Emergency Responders can assist in identifying potential safety hazards within housing estates, participate in fire safety inspections, and report risks to the FSD or PMCs. Besides, at the district level, the Government has strengthened the role of the 18 District Fire Safety Committees in fire prevention promotion, publicity, inspections and co-ordination.

(5) Section 20 of the BMO stipulates that an OC must establish and maintain a general fund to cover the expenses incurred in exercising its powers or performing its duties under the BMO and the deed of mutual covenant, as well as the day-to-day general expenses of the building. In addition, an OC may also set up a contingency fund to meet emergency needs or shortfalls in the general fund. The amount to be contributed by owners to these two funds is determined in accordance with the needs of the building by the owners.

As more buildings age, ensuring their structural safety requires repair works of varying scales. To alleviate the financial pressure on owners when handling repairs, there have been suggestions in the community to establish a mandatory repair reserve fund, enabling advance financial preparation for future repairs. Since this proposal involves matters related to building maintenance and repairs, the affordability and willingness of owners, etc, the relevant Government departments will conduct research and gather views from stakeholders.

(6) On November 28, 2025, following the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the Government established an Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force led by the FSD. The task force is investigating both the cause of the fire and the reasons for its spread, reviewing all relevant evidence and making full use of available technologies to assist in the investigation.

(7) The Government maintains an open attitude towards the use of technology to enhance the monitoring of building material standards or the tracking of building materials. Taking scaffolding nets as an example, the BD issued a Practice Note on December 19, 2025 to ensure that protective materials overlaid on external wall scaffolding meet fire retardant performance standards. The Practice Note requires Registered Contractors to adopt reliable systems (such as QR codes, Near Field Communication (NFC) devices, or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology) to facilitate the verification and tracking of material batches. In accordance with the requirements of the Practice Note, the Construction Industry Council previously provided a special arrangement for collective procurement of fire-retardant protective nets and utilised blockchain technology to ensure the transparency of the procurement process. From order placement, reporting of production progress, laboratory testing, and logistics delivery to the signing of receipt, the system records data from every key juncture to the blockchain. This forms a clear and immutable audit trail to prevent future alteration or falsification, setting a good example for the industry. As the materials involved in construction works are diverse, the BD will adopt a risk-based approach, and review which other types of building materials under the existing mechanism require enhanced regulation over material standards or tracking.

Separately, the BMO sets out clear requirements for the retention of documents. The Building Management (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, which came into effect in July 2025, further introduces criminal liability for failure to properly keep books of account, minutes of meetings, tender documents, and instruments of proxy. As for the format of document retention, it may be decided by the management committee of the OC."

Question:

  The Chief Executive proposed in the 2022 Policy Address the development of a ""Round-the-Island Trail"" (Island Trail) on Hong Kong Island to connect a number of promenades and countryside walking trails between the northern part of Hong Kong Island and the Southern District. To date, 85 per cent of the Island Trail has been connected. Regarding further improvements to its connectivity and accessibility, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that a number of waterfront sites in the Central and Western District have not been designated as land for the waterfront promenade due to operational needs or private ownership, etc, whether the Government has studied extending the waterfront promenade to these sites; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will conduct such studies;

(2) as there are views pointing out that the road section outside New Praya in Kennedy Town lacks a footpath for public use, and the entrance to Belcher Bay Promenade is separated by a bus terminus and obstructed by old trees, whether the Government will construct a boardwalk along the waterfront of the praya to connect the waterfront spaces on both sides, so as to enhance the accessibility of the Island Trail; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the works progress of the uncompleted road sections of the waterfront promenade in the southern part of Hong Kong Island, and the respective construction timetables?

Reply:

President,

  The ""Round-the-Island Trail"" (the Trail) spans approximately 60 kilometres, connecting the harbourfront promenades on the northern shore of Hong Kong Island and a number of existing promenades and countryside walking trails in the Southern District. The project commenced in phases since 2023 to expedite the connection of the missing links of the Trail and improve some of the existing sections. So far, 85 per cent of the Trail has been connected , with the target of connecting 90 per cent of the Trail within next year and completing the remaining works by the end of 2031.

  The reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Following the opening of the Eastern Section of the East Coast Boardwalk last month, the approximately 13-kilometre long harbourfront from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan has now been connected. Regarding the waterfront sites in the Central and Western District, most of them are connected in the form of promenades. While certain waterfront sites cannot offer promenades due to reasons such as operational needs or private ownership, pedestrian links are provided in the vicinity of the sites which connect to the adjacent waterfront areas. These sites in the Central and Western District are as follows:

(i) Shun Tak Centre: The lot is privately owned and primarily used for vehicular access at-grade. Pedestrian links are available in the vicinity which connect to other waterfront areas. However, these paths are rather circuitous involving several pedestrian walkways surrounding the Shun Tak Centre and crossing roads, or taking a nearby footbridge and through the Centre's shopping mall. The Government will continue to liaise with the landowner to explore options for enhancing the at-grade pedestrian access at this location.

(ii) Western District Public Cargo Working Area (WDPCWA): Part of the waterfront areas within the WDPCWA was previously released and converted to the Belcher Bay Promenade which has been popular among the public. It is necessary to continue using the remaining areas for loading, discharging and handling sea cargoes, serving the districts of Hong Kong Island west and outlying islands. The WDPCWA accounts for about 10 per cent of the total cargo handling volume of all public cargo working areas in Hong Kong. At the rear of the WDPCWA, pedestrian walkways are now available, connecting the promenade at both ends of the WDPCWA. To enhance accessibility and visitors' experience, the Development Bureau is carrying out beautification works on this pedestrian road section, including enhancing outdoor installations and wayfinding signage, which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of this year.

(iii)China Merchants Wharf: The lot is also privately owned. There is a pedestrian walkway on Sai Ning Street behind the wharf which connects the promenade on both sides of the private lot. Although currently the lot is primarily used as warehouse and pier, it has been rezoned under the relevant Outline Zoning Plan for integrated development of commercial, leisure, and tourism related uses, paving the way for the owner to change the land use through redevelopment. The concerned owner shall provide promenade along the waterfront for public use when undertaking redevelopment. The Government stands ready to discuss with the owner the feasible options put forward, with a view to providing more harbourfront spaces.

(2) To provide a safe and relaxing experience for visitors to enjoy the sunset view at the New Praya, Kennedy Town, we are considering utilising the streamlined mechanism under the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance amended last year to construct a boardwalk or seawall along the waterfront areas through small-scale reclamations or other solutions that do not require reclamation to provide pedestrian walkways. We target to put forth proposals for consultation in the second quarter this year. As regards the entrance to the Belcher Bay Promenade, although it is adjacent to a bus terminus and some large trees, as mentioned by the Hon Judy Chan, the road space meets the accessibility requirements and does not affect the overall connectivity. We will keep in view its usage and explore the feasibility to undergo enhancement with relevant departments from time to time.

(3) Projects which the Government completed last year in the Southern District to connect the Trail include the footbridge connecting the Cyberport Road and Waterfall Bay Park and the new walking trail between South Bay Beach and Chung Hom Kok Road. The walking trail construction between Tai Tam Road near Pacific View and Lo Fu Shan Catchwater, as well as the beautification works at Hairpin Beach open space, will be completed in the second and third quarters this year respectively. In addition, construction of two walking trail sections will commence this year, connecting Cape D'Aguilar Road to Shek O Beach, and Victoria Road to Sandy Bay rocky shore respectively. They will be completed by the end of this year.

  ​After connecting 90 per cent of the Trail by next year, the remaining 10 per cent with a length of about 6 kilometres mainly include sections such as Shau Kei Wan to Heng Fa Chuen, and the following sections in the Southern District: Brick Hill to Mills & Chung Path, Heung Yip Path to Shum Wan Pier Drive, Waterfall Bay Park to Kellett Bay Promenade, etc. These sections involve more technical considerations and complex works, such as slope improvement. We strive to largely complete them by the end of 2031. Regarding the road section along Big Wave Bay Road, where road space is very narrow, given the cost-effectiveness and the impact on nearby residences, it may not be suitable to construct a walking trail there. We are considering alternative proposals, such as rerouting the Trail via Dragon's Back, which has been recognised as Asia's Best Urban Hiking Trail.

  In taking forward the Trail or enhancing the waterfront, we have adopted the approach of ""tackling the simple issues first before the difficult ones"" as well as the ""incremental approach"", both of which are pragmatic and beneficial to the public. The Development Bureau will continue to follow this approach to provide more popular waterfront spaces and walking trails. Thank you, President."

The case has been reported to the Hospital Authority Head Office via the Advance Incident Reporting System."
立法會九題：推動本地農業發展,2026-01-28 17:30,2026-01-28 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800308.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上陳凱欣議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）和蔬菜統營處分別於一九九四年和一九九八年推出屬自願性質的「信譽農場計劃」（該計劃）及「好農夫信譽蔬菜」品牌，以鼓勵農場生產優質及安全食用的蔬菜。此外，據報現時本港有兩間私營有機認證機構（認證機構），提供有機食物認證服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年從事耕作活動的農場數目及耕地面積分別為何，並按（i）信譽農場、（ii）持有上述認證機構發出認證的農場及（iii）其他農場列出分項數字；

（二）過去五年，每年本地蔬菜及水果的產量分別為何，並按（i）信譽農場、（ii）持有上述認證機構發出認證的農場及（iii）其他農場列出分項數字；

（三）現時分別有多少個本地和內地農場參與該計劃，當中有多少個農場為「非活躍運作」（即其耕地已荒置並且沒有進行商業生產農作物）；過去五年，每年有多少個信譽農場因沒有活躍運作而被漁護署除名；

（四）現時成為信譽農場的資格為何；是否知悉，上述認證機構頒發有機認證的條件為何；漁護署會為參與該計劃和持有有機認證的農場提供何等支援和便利措施；

（五）過去五年，每年當局抽查本地蔬菜和水果的次數，以及當中驗出不合格樣本的個案宗數分別為何，並按（i）信譽農場、（ii）持有上述認證機構發出認證的農場及（iii）其他農場列出分項數字；當局會如何跟進不合格的樣本，包括會否向其來源農場作出調查；

（六）現時成為「信譽零售商」的條件為何；漁護署有否統計有多少個「信譽零售商」只出售來自信譽農場的農產品，以及有否要求有出售非信譽農場農產品的零售點透過標示區別有關農產品；及

（七）鑑於政府於二○二三年發表的《漁農業可持續發展藍圖》提出建立本地農業品牌，當局會否考慮整合該計劃和上述認證機構的有機認證服務，推出中央認證制度為本地農產品進行分級認證，以提高該等產品的吸引力和認受性？

答覆：

主席：

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）及蔬菜統營處（菜統處）於一九九四年攜手推行屬自願性質的「信譽農場計劃」，鼓勵本地農民採用優良園藝操作、環保作物生產方法和正確及安全使用農藥，藉此協助業界建立品牌。漁護署為參與計劃的農場（「信譽農場」）提供技術指導和農場測檢服務；而「信譽農場」生產並經菜統處批銷的農作物（包括新鮮蔬菜和瓜果等作物，「信譽蔬菜」）則由菜統處認可的「信譽零售商」出售。「信譽農場計劃」自一九九五年起推展至由港人在內地經營的農場。為增加市民的認識和信心，菜統處自一九九八年起以「好農夫信譽蔬菜」的品牌在零售層面宣傳和推廣「信譽蔬菜」，並為「信譽零售商」設計標誌和標示牌，方便市民識別。

就有機農場認證方面，香港有機資源中心是現時香港主要的有機認證機構，該機構獲漁護署的「農業持續發展基金」撥款進行「有機認證系統管理和營運及其支援和有機認證宣傳教育項目」，為農民提供自願性的認證服務，並為本地有機農產品進行宣傳及教育活動。截至二○二五年十二月，該機構認證了124個有機農場（「認證有機農場」）。至於另一間有機認證機構（即香港有機認證中心）沒有申請「農業持續發展基金」，自二○一二年三月起已沒有再更新其網頁上有關其認證的本地農場資料，漁護署亦沒有此資料。

就陳凱欣議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）及（三）根據漁護署的記錄，過去五年「信譽農場」、「認證有機農場」及其他農場的數目和耕地面積分別詳列如下：

（四）「信譽農場計劃」屬自願參與性質，參與計劃的農場須符合漁護署訂立的良好農業規範，包括正確使用除害劑及記錄耕作活動等。漁護署會抽檢收割前的農作物樣本作殘餘農藥測試，並指導農民安全使用農藥、採用環保作物生產方法和優良園藝操作以提升農作物的質素及打造優質和安全的品牌。

另外，香港有機資源中心參照國際有機農業運動聯盟的標準，制訂有機作物生產標準，並為本地農場提供有機認證服務。獲認證的農場需須遵守有關生產標準內的操作規定，並作妥善生產記錄。香港有機資源中心亦會對已獲認證的農場進行檢查，確保其生產的農作物符合標準。

為協助推動有機耕作，漁護署透過「有機耕作支援服務」向有意申請及已經獲得有機認證的農場提供技術支援，包括園藝技巧、土壤施肥管理和病蟲害防治等，並會派員實地視察及化驗土壤、灌溉水和農作物樣本，以協助農場取得及續領有機認證。

（五）食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（食安中心）持續透過食物監測計劃，按照風險為本的原則從進口、批發和零售／餐飲層面抽取食物樣本化驗。過去五年，食安中心抽檢本地出售蔬菜和水果的樣本數目分別為23 314個、22 434個、21 166個、19 979個和18 970個。食安中心沒有備存蔬菜或水果樣本的分項數字，亦沒有備存抽檢樣本屬本地生產或進口蔬果的資料。

當驗出不合格的樣本，食安中心會追溯該樣本的來源並採取適當的跟進行動，包括指令商戶將涉事批次的食品停售及下架等。如屬本地生產蔬果，食安中心亦會通知漁護署作出跟進。過去五年驗出的除害劑殘餘不合格本地樣本數目分別為三個、一個、兩個、兩個和一個，合共九個樣本當中，四個屬「信譽農場」，五個屬其他農場。食安中心過去五年沒有驗出重金屬含量不合格的本地蔬果樣本。

此外，漁護署會到「信譽農場」和「認證有機農場」抽檢收割前的農作物樣本作殘餘農藥測試及重金屬測試。過去五年，漁護署抽檢的樣本數目及驗出不合格的樣本數目表列如下：

當發現有「信譽農場」的農作物樣本懷疑含有超出標準的農藥殘餘或重金屬含量，漁護署會即時要求該農場延遲採收農作物，並加強巡視及再次抽樣，以確保他們正確使用農藥及出售前農作物已符合標準。於六個月內違規三次的農場會被取消「信譽農場」資格。

如來自「認證有機農場」的農作物樣本不合格，漁護署與香港有機資源中心會到該農場進行跟進調查，並要求農場停止出售該批農作物。如確認違反有機作物生產標準，香港有機資源中心會暫停或吊銷該農場的有機認證資格。

（六）商戶如有意申請成為「好農夫信譽蔬菜」品牌的零售商，需要提供於菜統處長沙灣蔬菜批發市場的購貨記錄，並經菜統處派員到訪零售點實地作營運情況評估合格後，才會獲簽發「信譽零售商」資格。

由於各零售商一般需要多樣化的蔬菜及瓜果種類以滿足營運和客戶需求，因此菜統處不會強制「信譽零售商」只能出售來自「信譽農場」的農產品。為方便公眾識別，菜統處會向「信譽零售商」發出「好農夫信譽蔬菜」的標誌和標示牌，並鼓勵零售商在貨架上透過標示牌區分「信譽蔬菜」與其他農產品。此外，菜統處會不定期安排到訪「信譽零售商」抽查其農產品樣本作化驗監測。截至二○二五年底，「信譽零售商」有217間，全部不只出售「信譽蔬菜」。

（七）為提升本地漁農產品的競爭力，漁護署會於今年年中為政府認可的各類優質本地漁農產品推出新的統一品牌，配合清晰的認證、檢測和溯源機制，突顯產品的優質價值，加強消費者信心。新統一品牌會取代現時分別為漁農業作品牌推廣的「優質養魚場計劃」和「信譽農場計劃」，而所有現時參與這兩個計劃的合資格漁農場將會全數加入新統一品牌的認證計劃，以便集中宣傳推廣。

至於有機農場認證方面，獲得國際有機農業運動聯盟認可的香港有機資源中心將會繼續根據其有機作物生產標準為農場提供有機認證服務，確保農場符合有機作物生產的要求，而獲其認證的有機農場亦可同時加入上述新統一品牌的認證計劃，以提升其產品的競爭力。

註一：過去五年間，每年分別有11個、11個、12個、12個和12個農場同時屬於「信譽農場」及「認證有機農場」，主要因為部分農場在申請有機認證期間仍繼續參與「信譽農場計劃」。

註二：由於部分「信譽農場」選擇透過直銷或其他渠道出售蔬菜，「信譽蔬菜」的批銷量逐年減少。

註三：其他農場的農作物產量中包含本地「信譽農場」種植的非「信譽蔬菜」的產量（即不是經由菜統處批發的農作物），漁護署沒有備存兩者的分項估算。

註四：樣本中的農藥殘餘含量高於香港法例第132CM章《食物內除害劑殘餘規例》附表1列明的最高殘餘限量，或重金屬含量高於香港法例第132V章《食物攙雜（金屬雜質含量）規例》列明的含量上限，會被視為不合格樣本。

註五：樣本中含有香港法例第132CM章《食物內除害劑殘餘規例》提及的或其他人工合成除害劑，或重金屬含量高於香港法例第132V章《食物攙雜（金屬雜質含量）規例》列明的含量上限，會被視為不合格樣本。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-28 17:30,2026-01-28 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800527.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月二十八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-28 17:30,2026-01-28 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800526.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 28), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
LCQ9: Promoting development of local agriculture,2026-01-28 17:30,2026-01-28 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800312.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (January 28):

Question:

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) and the Vegetable Marketing Organization launched the voluntary Accredited Farm Scheme (the Scheme) and the ""Good Farmer"" brand for ""accredited vegetables"" respectively in 1994 and 1998 to encourage farms to produce quality vegetables that are safe for consumption. In addition, it has been reported that there are currently two private agencies (certification organisations) in Hong Kong which provide organic food certification services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of farms engaged in farming and their respective cultivated area in each of the past five years, with a breakdown by (i) accredited farms, (ii) farms with certifications issued by the aforesaid certification organisations, and (iii) other farms;

(2) of the local production of vegetables and fruit in each of the past five years, with a breakdown by (i) accredited farms, (ii) farms with certifications issued by the aforesaid certification organisations, and (iii) other farms;

(3) of the number of local and Mainland farms currently participating in the Scheme; among them, the number of farms which are ""inactive"" (i.e. their agricultural land has been abandoned and no commercial crop production is taking place); and the number of accredited farms delisted by the AFCD due to inactivity in each of the past five years;

(4) of the current eligibility criteria for becoming an accredited farm; whether it knows the conditions adopted by the aforesaid certification organisations for granting organic certification; and the support and facilitation measures provided by the AFCD to farms participating in the Scheme and to farms with organic certification;

(5) the number of investigations conducted by the authorities on local vegetables and fruits by way of sample testing in each of the past five years, and the number of cases where unsatisfactory samples were detected, with a breakdown by (i) accredited farms, (ii) farms with certifications issued by the aforesaid certification organisations, and (iii) other farms; and how the authorities follow up on unsatisfactory samples, including whether they will conduct investigations into the farms from which such samples originate;

(6) of the current requirements for becoming an ""accredited retailer""; whether the AFCD has compiled statistics on the number of ""accredited retailers"" which sell only agricultural produce from accredited farms, and whether it requires retail outlets selling agricultural produce from non-accredited farms to distinguish such produce by labelling; and

(7) given that the Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries published by the Government in 2023 proposes the building of local agricultural products brand, will the authorities consider integrating the Scheme and the organic certification services of the aforesaid certification organisations to introduce a centralised certification system for grading local agricultural products so as to enhance their attractiveness and recognition?

Reply:

President,

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) and the Vegetable Marketing Organization (VMO) have jointly launched the voluntary Accredited Farm Scheme in 1994, which encourages local farmers to adopt good horticultural practices, environmentally-friendly crop production methods, and the proper and safe use of pesticides, thereby assisting the industry in brand building. The AFCD provides technical support and sample-testing services for participating farms (""accredited farms""). Crops produced by these ""accredited farms"" and marketed through the VMO (including fresh vegetables and fruits, ""accredited vegetables"") is sold by ""accredited retailers"" authorised by the VMO. Since 1995, the Accredited Farm Scheme has extended to cover farms in the Chinese Mainland operated by Hong Kong residents. To enhance public awareness and confidence, the VMO has been promoting ""accredited vegetables"" at the retail level under the ""Good Farmer"" brand since 1998, with logos and signages designed for ""accredited retailers"" for easy identification by the public.

On organic certification service, the Hong Kong Organic Resource Centre (HKORC) is the major organic certification body in Hong Kong. With funding from the Sustainable Agricultural Development Fund (SADF) administered by the AFCD, the HKORC has launched a project on ""Management, Operation and Support for an Organic Certification System, and Publicity and Education of Organic Certification"" to provide farmers with voluntary certification service, and carry out publicity and education activities to promote local organic agricultural products. As at December 2025, the HKORC has certified 124 organic farms (""certified organic farms""). As for another organic certification body, i.e. the Hong Kong Organic Certification Centre, it has not applied for the SADF. Since March 2012, its website has not been updated with information about local farms it certified. The AFCD does not have such information either.

Reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan is as follows:

(1) and (3) According to the AFCD's records, the respective numbers and cultivated areas of ""accredited farms"", ""certified organic farms"" and other farms over the past five years are tabulated as follows:

The AFCD conducts regular visits to ""accredited farms"" in both Hong Kong and the Mainland. If a farm was found left fallow for a long time or no longer engaged in commercial production, its ""accredited farm"" status would be lifted. The number of farms withdrew from the Accredited Farm Scheme over the past five years due to operational inactivity is tabulated as follows:

(2) According to the AFCD's records, the total local crop production volumes from 2021 to 2025 were approximately 15300tonnes, 15100tonnes, 15800tonnes, 15300tonnes and 15400tonnes respectively. The AFCD does not maintain a breakdown of vegetable or fruit production. The production of ""accredited vegetables"" from ""accredited farms"", as well as crops from ""certified organic farms"" and other farms over the past five years are as follows:

(4) Participation in the Accredited Farm Scheme is voluntary in nature. Participating farms are required to adhere to the good agricultural practices drawn up by the AFCD, such as the proper use of pesticides and the keeping of cultivation records. The AFCD will carry out pre-harvest sampling of crops for pesticide residue analysis, and provide guidance to farmers on the proper use of pesticides, adoption of environmentally-friendly crop production methods and good horticultural practices, so as to enhance the quality of crops and create a premium and safe brand.

On the other hand, the HKORC has established a set of organic crop production standards with reference to the standards set out by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, and provides organic certification service to local farms. Farms being certified are required to comply with the operational rules specified in these production standards and maintain proper production records. The HKORC also conducts inspections of certified farms to ensure that their produce meets the standards.

To facilitate the promotion of organic farming, the AFCD provides technical support to farms that intend to apply for or have already obtained organic certification through the ""Organic Farming Support Service"", including support in horticultural skills, soil fertility management, pest and disease control, and deploys staff for on-site inspections and sampling of soil, irrigation water and crops for testing, thereby assisting farms in acquiring and maintaining their organic certification.

(5) The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department implements the Food Surveillance Programme to collect food samples for testing at the import, wholesale and retail/catering levels under a risk-based principle on an ongoing basis. Over the past five years, the CFS collected and tested 23314, 22434, 21166, 19979 and 18970 vegetable and fruit samples for sale locally. The CFS does not keep a breakdown of vegetable or fruit samples, nor does it keep the information of whether the samples collected were locally produced or imported.

When an unsatisfactory sample was detected, the CFS will trace its source and take appropriate follow-up actions, including instructing the vendors to stop selling and remove from shelves the affected batch of food. If the vegetable or fruit is locally produced, the CFS will also refer the case to the AFCD for follow-up. Over the past five years, the number of unsatisfactory local samples detected with pesticide residues exceeding the limits were three, one, two, two, and one respectively. Among the nine samples in total, four were from ""accredited farms"" and five were from other farms. The CFS has not detected any local fruit or vegetable sample with unsatisfactory heavy metal content over the past five years.
​
Moreover, the AFCD will visit ""accredited farms"" and ""certified organic farms"" to conduct pre-harvest sampling of crops for testing of pesticide residues and heavy metal. The number of samples collected by the AFCD for testing and that with unsatisfactory findings over the past five years are tabulated as follows:

When crop sample from an ""accredited farm"" is suspected of containing pesticide residues or heavy metal content exceeding the prescribed limits, the AFCD will immediately require the farm to delay the harvesting of the crops and step up inspections and collect follow-up samples to ensure pesticides have been used properly and that the crops meet the food safety standards before being sold. Farms with three violations within six months will have their ""accredited farm"" status lifted.

If crop sample from a ""certified organic farm"" is unsatisfactory, The AFCD and the HKORC will visit the farm for follow-up investigation and require the farm to stop the sale of the concerned batch of crops. If a non-compliance with the organic crop production standard is confirmed, the HKORC will suspend or revoke the organic certification of the farm.

(6) Vendors who wish to apply to be retailers to sell ""accredited vegetables"" using the ""Good Farmer"" brand must provide records of purchase at the Cheung Sha Wan Vegetable Wholesale Market of the VMO and satisfy the on-site operational assessment conducted by the VMO staff at the retail outlets before they are qualified as ""accredited retailers"".

Since retailers often need to provide a diverse range of vegetables and fruits to meet operational and customer demands, the VMO will not mandate ""accredited retailers"" to sell agricultural products from ""accredited farms"" alone. For easy identification by the public, the VMO will disseminate ""Good Farmer"" logos and signages to ""accredited retailers"", and encourage them to display the signages on shelves to differentiate ""accredited vegetables"" from other agricultural products. In addition, the VMO will arrange visits from time to time to ""accredited retailers"" for random sampling of agricultural products for testing. As at end-2025, there were 217 ""accredited retailers"" and all of them are not just selling ""accredited vegetables"" alone.

(7) To enhance the competitiveness of local agricultural and fisheries products, the AFCD will launch a new unified brand for a wide range of government-recognised high-quality local agricultural and fisheries products in mid-2026. This will be supported by clear certification, testing and traceability mechanisms to highlight the premium value of the products and strengthen consumer confidence. The new unified brand will replace the existing Accredited Fish Farm Scheme and Accredited Farm Scheme which promote fisheries and agricultural products respectively. All eligible fish and crop farms currently participating in these two schemes will be fully integrated into the certification programme under the new unified brand for focused promotion and marketing.

As for the certification of organic farms, the HKORC accredited by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements will continue to provide organic certification service to farms based on the organic crop production standards it has promulgated, ensuring that farms comply with the organic production requirements. ""Certified organic farms"" may also participate in the abovementioned certification programme under the new unified brand to enhance their competitiveness.

Note 1: In each of the past five years, there were respectively 11, 11, 12, 12, and 12 farms classified as both ""accredited farms"" and ""certified organic farms"" at the same time. This was because some farms continued to participate in the Accredited Farm Scheme while applying for organic certification.

Note 2: Since some ""accredited farms"" choose to distribute vegetables through direct sales or other channels, the market throughput of ""accredited vegetables"" has gradually decreased year on year.

Note 3: The production of crops from other farms includes crops grown by local ""accredited farms"" that are not ""accredited vegetables"" (i.e. crops not marketed through the VMO). The AFCD does not maintain the breakdown of the concerned items.

Note 4: Samples with a pesticide residue content higher than the maximum residue limit specified in Schedule 1 of the Pesticide Residues in Food Regulation (Cap. 132CM), or with a heavy metal content higher than the maximum level specified in the Food Adulteration (Metallic Contamination) Regulations (Cap. 132V), are regarded as unsatisfactory.

Note 5: Samples containing pesticides mentioned in the Pesticide Residues in Food Regulation (Cap. 132CM) or other synthetic pesticides, or with a heavy metal content higher than the maximum level specified in the Food Adulteration (Metallic Contamination) Regulations (Cap. 132V), are regarded as unsatisfactory."
立法會：運輸及物流局局長就「促進陸路跨境交通」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-28 17:20,2026-01-28 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800530.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上就何敬康議員動議的「促進陸路跨境交通」議案的開場發言︰

主席：

自香港特別行政區成立以來，香港與內地加快融合。而自《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》於二○一九年公布以來，粵港澳三地政府緊密合作，按照國家政策，推動大灣區的經濟融合和深化互聯互通，推進高質量建設大灣區。加上受惠於內地居民訪港政策的持續開放，北上南下雙向奔赴更趨常態化，對粵港澳三地交通聯繫需求帶來顯著增長，隨之而至的是無盡機遇。

香港擁有世界級運輸基礎設施，以及以鐵路為骨幹的公共交通系統，相互配合提供多元化的交通模式；交通網絡配合新增通關口岸發展，亦配合各原有口岸提升通關能力。特區政府持續與粵、澳政府逐步升級運輸基建設施及跨境交通服務，同時持續制定粵港與港澳車輛創新通行政策和配套交通管理措施，香港至今已增設至共九個陸路管制站。政府因應各口岸的性質和定位，規劃合適的公共交通接駁服務，以滿足顯著增加的陸路跨境出行需求。

在跨境軌道交通方面，羅湖及落馬洲支線作為鐵路口岸，由港鐵公司提供東鐵線過境服務；來往落馬洲支線口岸的過境旅客亦可使用專營巴士、專線小巴及的士服務。二○一八年高速鐵路（高鐵）香港段通車，為跨境旅客提供一個嶄新和更直接連通全國網絡的鐵路出行選擇。現時高鐵連接48 000公里的國家高鐵網絡，由二○二六年一月二十六日起直達110個內地站點，每日開行最少212班車。憑着「一地兩檢」的便捷通關安排，以及高效及舒適的服務，高鐵香港段吸引大量旅客選用，累計客量已突破一億人次，是大灣區一小時生活圈的重要組成部分，亦鞏固了香港作為區域交通樞紐的地位。特區政府會聯同港鐵公司繼續與內地當局持續提升高鐵服務，充分發揮高鐵的社會經濟效益及與全國高鐵網絡互聯互通的優勢。

至於道路交通方面，現時設有多條專營巴士及小巴路線往來香港不同地點與各陸路口岸，照顧市民的跨境出行需要。政府規劃公共交通服務網絡時，會綜合考慮乘客需求、口岸的設計和空間、實際路面及交通情況等，致力維持本地往來各口岸運輸系統的高效率，並會監察各公共交通服務情況，適時指導及協調本地公交服務營辦商。因應各個道路管制站的通關能力，更設有合適和足夠的跨境巴士、口岸穿梭巴士及跨境出租車服務。為配合新皇崗口岸啓用，運輸署現正規劃合適的公共交通服務，包括專營巴士、專線小巴及的士直達口岸，而連接新田站和深圳新皇崗口岸的北環線支線預計可於二○三四年或之前與北環線主線同步開通。在出行高峰期間，尤其是在長假期期間，政府會一如以往與各交通服務營辦商制定預案，提前安排額外人手及車輛，靈活應對需求及加快疏導旅客，亦會與內地和澳門相關單位協調，增發跨境巴士特別加班配額以增加服務班次。

另一方面，粵港澳三地政府按現行跨境私家車常規配額的機制，有序增加跨境私家車數目。香港及澳門當局共同管理港澳私家車常規配額制度，兩地政府一直密切留意配額的使用情況並適時檢討和優化安排。目前，港澳配額已增至約17 000個。正如我們於二○二四年六月向立法會交通事務委員會報告，我們會劃出一部分新增配額，開放予所有香港永久性居民和香港註冊公司申請，即申請人不受現時申請資格所限，而澳門已於早前開始推行，以期進一步用好港珠澳大橋和促進港澳之間的人員流動。至於粵港私家車的常規配額制度，就有關建議研究粵港私家車「一車多關」的安排，即容許持有粵港兩地車牌的私家車，除了按原有指定口岸過境外，亦可以選擇其他口岸往來粵港兩地，特區政府歡迎有關建議，以期進一步便利粵港兩地的交通往來。我期待稍後聆聽各位議員的意見。

主席，秉持創新求變的精神，提升大灣區人員和車輛流動的便捷度，在二○二三年七月我們推出「港車北上」，並剛於去年底開通「粵車南下」，兩項措施雙配合，深化粵港兩地市民雙向奔赴。「港車北上」推出至今廣受香港市民歡迎，出行車次佔大橋車流量約四成。「粵車南下」用家亦反應良好，實施至今，口岸停車場有超過2 000車次預約使用，而入境市區部分有超過2 500宗申請，預約則超過1 000宗，節假日特別受歡迎。隨着更多申請陸續獲批，更多參加者會按出行需要和計劃預約來港。在「港車北上」方面，粵港兩地已持續優化安排，包括驗車、續期、出行預約縮短期限並取消平日星期二、三的預約安排。同樣地，政府會繼續按確保安全、有效分流、完備配套和簡便申請四大策略，穩步增潤「粵車南下」安排，亦會和廣東有關部門持續檢視使用情況和改善安排。

政府在牌證方面亦已推出便利化措施，尤其是利用科技提速提效。我們感謝立法會通過修例，自二○二五年十月起運輸署容許網上申請及發出電子版本的國際通行許可證，而申請人在申請時只需提交許可證生效當日有效的保險證明，減少保險有效期在許可證申請處理期間被消耗的情況。在封閉道路通行許可證方面，運輸署已豁免指定跨境駕駛計劃的車輛，例如參加「港車北上」的車輛，申請人只需向運輸署申請參與計劃的資格，毋須申請許可證；以及延長其他跨境車輛封閉道路通行許可證有效期至最長60個月，免卻配額持有人每年為許可證續期的需要。在「免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照」（「免試簽發」）安排方面，申請人可預先透過網上預約系統，或憑「電子即日籌」使用櫃位服務遞交申請，全面取代現場派籌，以確保有需要人士公平有序地使用有關服務。為準備全面推行網上預約櫃位服務，運輸署數月來一直如火如荼地展開籌備工作優化系統，現正進行最後階段工作，確保系統穩定性，包括強化虛擬排隊系統、利用「智方便」和透過人工智能核實申請人的身分、使用一次性密碼核實等。我們極力爭取盡快推出全面網上預約，運輸署同時亦積極研究利用人工智能技術處理「免試簽發」申請程序，讓申請人可於新網上平台上載申請文件供系統作初步審批，然後按其預約時段前往牌照事務處核實文件正本，更好確保申請過程順暢快捷。

在口岸服務方面，政府一直密切監察各邊境管制站的運作，便利香港與內地居民雙向往來。面對持續增長的跨境出行需求，特區政府一直與內地相關部委緊密合作，從多個方面包括規劃協調、調配人手、完善口岸設施等提升陸路口岸的整體通關能力。

主席，我謹此陳辭，並樂意聽取各位議員的意見。稍後本人和保安局副局長會一一作出回應。"
立法會七題：公營醫療收費改革的推行情況,2026-01-28 17:13,2026-01-28 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800248.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上陳克勤議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

公營醫療收費改革的各項措施於本年一月一日起實施。然而，有不少市民反映醫療費用減免的申請程序繁複，有機會延誤求診病人的治療。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，在本年一月一日實施新急症室收費前及後，四類分流類別（即「危殆」、「危急」、「緊急」，以及「次緊急和非緊急」）的求診人數變化分別為何；

（二）是否知悉，現時已申請醫療費用減免（包括全數減免及部分減免）的人數分別為何，以及該等數目佔預計合資格申請醫療費用減免總人數的百分比分別為何；

（三）鑑於申請醫療費用減免者須提交電子錢包（例如PayMe／支付寶／微信支付）戶口號碼、其過去六個月的交易及結餘紀錄截圖等若干文件，政府是否知悉，醫院管理局（醫管局）有否統計至今每宗申請個案平均所需提交的文件數目及頁數為何；

（四）據報醫管局表示，醫療費用減免申請人交齊所須文件後最快即日可獲審批，政府是否知悉（i）至今獲即日審批的個案數目及（ii）其佔所有申請個案數目的百分比，以及（iii）審批每宗個案的平均所需時間為何；

（五）是否知悉，現時市民前往公立醫院／診所的醫務社會服務部、所住地區的社會福利署綜合家庭服務中心等其他指定服務單位遞交醫療費用減免申請時的平均輪候時間為何；醫管局會否考慮增加18區地區康健中心或地區康健站，作為申請醫療費用減免所設的指定服務單位；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（六）鑑於醫管局於本年一月至三月的過渡期內，容許有經濟困難的病人可先獲「有條件減免」醫療費用，但須在三個月內補交相關文件，政府是否知悉，至今有關申請的數目及其所佔病人總數的百分比為何，以及醫管局會在何種情況下延長過渡期；

（七）鑑於現時醫療費用減免的最長有效期為18個月，政府是否知悉，醫管局會否在減免期完結前提醒病人須再次申請減免；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；鑑於醫管局表示，再次申請減免的病人只須確認家庭財政狀況不變便無須再提交文件作審查，該局會否向該等個案進行抽查；及

（八）鑑於不少市民表示，希望加強監察關乎公眾利益的公營醫療收費事宜，政府會否參考其他涉及政府收費的法例的做法，修訂《醫院管理局條例》（第113章）第18條，透過附屬法例形式列出醫療費用，讓本會可審議有關醫療收費的事宜；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳克勤議員的提問，經諮詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現回覆如下：

公營醫療收費改革旨在透過改革資助架構，引導市民善用醫療資源、減少浪費濫用，與此同時全方位加強對「貧、急、重、危」四類病人的醫療保障，從而提升醫療系統的可持續性，並強化公營醫療系統來應對人口老化、慢性疾病日益普遍及醫療資源持續緊張等挑戰，發揮全民安全網的作用。改革的各項措施已自二○二六年一月一日起順利推行。

（一）公營醫療收費改革實施以來初見成效，公立醫院急症室整體求診人次有所減少，第四／五類別次緊急及非緊急病人數目顯著下降。第一／二類別危殆／危急病人即使數目上升仍能全面達標獲優先救治，而第三類別緊急病人接受治療的平均等候時間亦有所下降。急症室做到集中資源救急扶危，急症病人救治效率獲得提升。

下表載列二○二五年（全年）、二○二五年一月一日至一月二十五日及二○二六年一月一日至一月二十五日醫管局轄下各個分流類別的急症室就診總人次及每日平均就診人次。

註：各個分流類別的就診人次，不包括（i）首次就診而未有分流類別的就診人次，以及（ii）急症室覆診人次。

數據顯示，二○二六年一月一日至一月二十五日共有119 733名病人前往醫管局轄下18間急症室就診，較去年同期顯著減少近15%，其中6 719名病人分流類別為危殆及危急，較去年同期上升4.8%，但優先救治全面達標（危殆即時獲救治、危急於15分鐘內獲救治），而此類病人在新收費機制下獲全數豁免急症室收費，優於收費改革前需要繳費；53 621名病人分流為緊急，較去年同期下跌7.2%，次緊急及非緊急則為59 393人，較去年同期大減超過兩成達21.1%。

此外，比較醫管局急症室服務二○二六年一月一日至一月二十五日數字與去年同期數字：


分流類別為緊急的病人，於30分鐘內就診服務承諾達標比率，由78.3%增加至86.9%，而平均等候時間亦由25分鐘縮短至20分鐘；
五類分流類別中，次緊急及非緊急病人佔比由54.0%減少至49.6%；及
次緊急及非緊急病人平均等候時間由144分鐘減少至120分鐘。


急症室最新數據反映公營醫療收費改革，能有效幫助最有需要的「貧、急、重、危」病人中的「急」類病人。急症室的資源更能導向於處理危急病人，部分非緊急或有其他醫療需要的病人尋求急症室以外合適的醫療服務亦有助減低整體輪候時間及急症室人滿之患，達到公營醫療收費改革的初衷，將資源集中及有效治療有緊急醫療需要的病人及改善急症室就醫環境。

（二）、（四）及（五）作為公營醫療收費改革的重要部分，醫管局同時擴大了醫療費用減免機制。除改革前後均受惠於全額醫療費用豁免的約60萬人（即綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受助人及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人）外，其他合資格低收入人士估計由過往約30萬大幅增至約140萬，即額外增加110萬低收入人士潛在可以受惠，令有限的醫療資源可更精準投放幫助最有需要的「貧、急、重、危」中的「貧」類病人，確保不會有病人因為經濟原因而未能接受醫療服務。

自公營醫療收費改革實施以來，醫管局批出的醫療費用減免申請較以往以倍數大幅增加。截至二○二六年一月二十五日，收費改革不足一個月內，醫管局已批出107 865宗醫療費用減免申請（當中包括104 365宗獲批全數豁免及3 500宗獲批部分減免），數目已遠高於過往每年約14 000名病人獲批減免，亦即到目前為止已至少有額外93 000多名病人受惠於醫療費用減免放寬後的安全網，從改革前需付全費，改為現時獲得費用減免，顯示改革有效加強支援低收入家庭及弱勢社群。近日數據顯示，醫管局每日平均接獲醫療費用減免申請宗數已由高峰期超過5 900宗減至約4 800宗。

各公立醫院已加派人手，包括服務大使、專隊職員及義工等，協助解答病人查詢及分流處理醫療費用減免申請等安排。根據各指定服務單位的批核紀錄，大部分個案均可於即日完成辦理申請手續。目前平均約82%申請個案成功即日獲批減免，部分聯網更超過90%，相關個案可於即日獲發醫療費用減免證明書。

為方便合資格病人可於應診前獲批醫療費用減免證明書，醫管局建議病人可以在就診前預留約一至兩個月時間開始辦理申請手續。醫管局現時已接受預約診期為兩個月內的病人申請醫療費用減免。預約診期為超過兩個月後或未有任何預約的市民現階段無須急於申請。

現時屬醫管局或社會福利署的公職人員獲授權批核醫療費用減免的申請，醫管局經評估後認為足以應付目前申請需求。由於處理醫療費用減免牽涉病人及家庭成員的個人資料、經濟狀況、病歷、健康狀況等，亦關乎公帑運用，必須小心謹慎處理。地區康健中心由不同的非政府機構營運，並有其不同的使命和提供不同服務，現階段未有需要考慮利用地區康健中心處理醫療費用減免申請。

（三）醫療費用減免機制旨為經濟有困難而有醫療需要的病人提供援助，確保他們不會因經濟原因而得不到適當的醫療照顧，故必須進行經濟審查，而事實上亦並非所有人皆符合資格獲減免。醫管局基於善用公帑必須審慎處理每宗申請，病人亦有責任提供完整、準確、真確及合適的資料，以供評估和核對，令援助能確實幫助真正有需要的病人。醫管局在確保不會有病人因為經濟困難而未能接受合適醫療服務的同時，亦必須秉持審慎運用資源的原則，讓有限及珍貴的公共資源不被濫用。

醫療費用減免的申請以家庭為基礎作資格評估。一般而言，病人和被納入經濟審查的家庭成員需要遞交的文件包括身份證明、同住證明、收入證明和資產證明。每個申請個案需要遞交的文件數量視乎不同因素，包括病人的家庭成員數目、病人及其被納入經濟審查的家庭成員的經濟及資產狀況等，例如持有較多銀行戶口或資產結構及分布複雜的人士會需要遞交較多文件。然而，一般因經濟困難而符合醫療費用減免申請人士為低收入家庭，資產較簡單，審批過程對相關人士並不複雜。

除擴大醫療費用減免機制，以幫助最有需要的「貧、急、重、危」病人中的「貧」類病人外，公營醫療收費改革所得的額外資源將全數用於提升公營醫療服務，特別是增加對「貧、急、重、危」病人中的「重、危」類病人的資助，包括增設一萬元收費上限，令多病重病須長期住院或頻密使用醫院服務的病人多一重保障，同時醫管局亦會繼續擴大藥物名冊引入符合效益的新藥，並且增加標準醫療用器械及耗材的資助。政府亦會將安全有效的創新藥械納入安全網，通過撒瑪利亞基金為未能負擔昂貴治療的病人提供額外資助。

（六）為了處理新增的醫療費用減免申請，醫管局在二○二六年一月至三月過渡期間採取特別彈性安排，為有經濟困難而需即日或緊急接受治療，但又未能提供相關文件完成經濟審查的病人，發出「有條件減免」豁免全額或部分醫療費用。有關病人只需簽署聲明書及聲明大概經濟狀況，便可獲批有效期為三個月的全額或部分的「有條件減免」，並可即時使用減免醫療費用，確保他們不會因為有經濟困難而未能接受適切的醫療服務。截至二○二六年一月二十五日，醫管局已批出的107 865宗醫療費用減免申請中，56 862宗為「有條件減免」申請。

合資格的病人須在三個月內補交相關文件，通過審查後便可獲發正式醫療費用減免證明書。如病人未能於三個月限期內提交文件或未符合相關申請資格，屆時必須清繳所有應繳的費用（如有）。為了確保醫療資源運用恰當，並防止被濫用，醫管局會定期隨機覆查已批核的個案。

醫管局將會密切留意醫療費用減免申請情況，檢視過渡性安排。

（七）在公營醫療收費改革實施後的醫療費用減免機制下，費用減免的最長有效期由以往的12個月延長至18個月，減少病人需重複申請的次數。為了進一步便利市民，醫管局亦已減少重複核實病人收入和資產資料的需要，病人如需於最多18個月內再次申請減免，只需簽署聲明書確認家庭財政狀況不變，無須重新提交經濟文件作審查。

正如前文所述，醫療費用減免機制旨在為經濟有困難而有醫療需要的病人提供援助，確保他們不會因經濟原因而得不到適當的醫療照顧。病人是否需要在減免期完結後再作申請視乎病人當時的醫療需要和經濟狀況。病人可以參考醫療費用減免證明書上列明的減免有效期，並且在有效期完結時檢視自己的財務狀況和醫療需要，再自行判斷是否需要在覆診前再作申請。

由於醫療費用減免機制涉及公帑運用，病人有責任提供完整、準確、真確及合適的資料，以供醫管局評估和核對申請，讓真正有需要的病人獲得援助。而在遞交申請或提供聲明書後，及在醫療費用減免證明書有效期間，如病人家庭的財政或家庭狀況有變，有可能導致影響其獲得醫療費用減免的資格，病人必須立刻通知醫管局，並提供所有相關資料重新審查。

為了確保醫療費用援助制度健全及防止被濫用，醫管局會定期覆查已批核的個案，包括上述因病人家庭的財政或家庭狀況有變而需重新接受經濟審查，以及於18個月內再次申請，經簽署聲明書確認家庭財政狀況不變而無須重新進行經濟審查的個案。

（八）根據《醫院管理局條例》（第113章）第4和18條，醫管局須就公眾使用醫院服務須付的費用，向醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長建議恰當的政策，但須顧及不應有人因缺乏金錢而不能獲得適當醫療的原則。醫衞局局長可就醫管局行使釐訂收費相關權力發出指示，而醫管局須予遵從。根據第18條釐訂的收費，必須刊憲公布。政府及醫管局一直廣泛聽取持份者就公營醫療收費改革意見，並致力提升資訊透明度。自二○二五年三月二十五日公布收費改革方案以來，醫衞局和醫管局除於二○二五年四月向立法會衞生事務委員會作簡報外，亦主動約見不同政團、專業團體、醫護人員、病人組織及相關諮詢架構，作詳細講解及交流。同時，當局於二○二五年四月及十二月分別舉行區議會簡報會，並製作專題網頁、資訊套、短片及宣傳刊物，協助市民了解新安排。此外，醫衞局和醫管局會按既有機制每兩年檢討一次收費改革的實施情況和成效，持續監察改革進度。政府現時並無計劃修訂《醫院管理局條例》（第113章）與醫院服務收費相關的安排。"
LCQ7: Implementation of fees and charges reform for public healthcare,2026-01-28 17:13,2026-01-28 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800253.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hak-kan and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (January 28):

Question:

The various measures under the fees and charges reform for public healthcare have been implemented starting from January 1 this year. However, many members of the public have relayed that the application procedures for medical fee waivers are complicated, which may delay treatment for patients seeking consultation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the respective changes in the numbers of persons seeking consultation under the four triage categories (i.e. ""critical"", ""emergency"", ""urgent"" as well as ""semi-urgent and non-urgent"") before and after the implementation of the new accident and emergency fees on January 1 this year;

(2) whether it knows the respective current numbers of persons who have applied for medical fee waivers (including full and partial waivers), and the respective percentages of such numbers in the estimated total number of persons eligible to apply for medical fee waivers;

(3) given that applicants for medical fee waivers are required to submit certain documents such as screenshots of the account numbers of e-wallets (e.g. PayMe/Alipay/WeChat Pay), transaction records for the past six months and balance, whether the Government knows whether the Hospital Authority (HA) has compiled statistics on the average number of documents and pages required to be submitted for each application to date;

(4) as it has been reported that HA has indicated that applicants for medical fee waivers may be granted approval as quickly as the same day after submitting all required documents, whether the Government knows (i) the number of cases approved on the same day to date and (ii) its percentage in the total number of applications, as well as (iii) the average time required for approving each case;

(5) whether it knows the current average waiting time for members of the public to submit applications for medical fee waivers at other designated service units such as the Medical Social Services Units of public hospitals/clinics and the Social Welfare Department's Integrated Family Service Centres in their localities; whether HA will consider the inclusion of District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses in all 18 districts as designated service units for applications for medical fee waivers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(6) given that while HA allows patients who cannot afford medical expenses to first receive ""conditional waivers"" for medical fees during the transition period from January to March this year, they need to submit relevant documents within three months, whether the Government knows the number of such applications to date and its percentage in the total number of patients, and under what circumstances HA will extend the transition period;

(7) given that the current maximum validity period for medical fee waivers is 18 months, whether the Government knows whether HA will remind patients to reapply for waivers before expiry of the waiver period; if HA will, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; as HA has indicated that patients reapplying for waivers are only required to confirm no change in household financial condition without resubmitting documents for review, whether HA will conduct random checks on such cases; and

(8) given that many members of the public have expressed the hope to strengthen the monitoring of fees and charges for public healthcare concerning public interests, whether the Government will, with reference to the approach of other legislation relating to government fees and charges, amend section 18 of the Hospital Authority Ordinance (Cap. 113) to set out the medical fees by way of subsidiary legislation, so that this Council can deliberate on matters relating to medical fees and charges; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hak-kan is as follows:

The fees and charges reform for public healthcare aims to, through reforming the subsidisation structure, guide the public to make optimal use of healthcare resources, reduce wastage and abuse, and enhance healthcare protection for the four categories of ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients on all fronts, thereby enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare system and strengthening the public healthcare system to cope with the challenges posed by an ageing population, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, persistent strain on healthcare resources, etc., and serve as a safety net for all. The various measures under the reform have been successfully implemented since January 1, 2026.

(1) Since the implementation of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare, there have been signs of initial success, with an overall decrease in the number of attendances at Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) of public hospitals and a significant drop in semi-urgent and non-urgent (Category IV and V) cases. Critical and emergency (Category I and II) cases have been accorded priority in treatment with the service pledge target fully met, despite a rise in the number of such cases. The average waiting time for urgent (Category III) patients to receive treatment has also decreased. Resources at A&Es are more effectively focused on critical and emergency care, resulting in improved efficiency in treating emergency patients.

The table below sets out the total A&E attendances and the average daily attendances by triage category of the HA for (i) the full year of 2025; (ii) January 1-25, 2025; and (iii) January 1-25, 2026.

Note: The attendance figures for each triage category exclude (i) first attendances without a triage category assigned; and (ii) follow‑up attendances at A&Es.

According to the statistics, from January 1 to 25, 2026, a total of 119 733 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA, representing a significant decrease of nearly 15 per cent compared to the same period last year. Among those cases, 6 719 patients were triaged as critical and emergency cases, which despite showing an increase of 4.8 per cent compared to the same period last year, were all accorded priority in treatment in full compliance with the service pledge target (i.e. immediate treatment for critical cases and treatment within 15 minutes for emergency cases). These patients were exempted from A&E fees under the new fees and charges mechanism, which was better off than before the reform where they were required to pay. A total of 53 621 patients were triaged as urgent cases, representing a decrease of 7.2 per cent compared to the same period last year. A total of 59 393 patients were classified as semi-urgent and non-urgent cases, marking a substantial decrease of 21.1 per cent compared to the same period last year.

Moreover, comparing the statistics of HA A&E services from January 1 to 25, 2026 with the figures over the same period last year:


For patients triaged as urgent cases, the percentage of those being treated within 30 minutes - meeting the service pledge target - increased from 78.3 per cent to 86.9 per cent, with the average waiting time reduced from 25 to 20 minutes;
Among the five triage categories, the proportion of semi‑urgent and non‑urgent patients decreased from 54.0 per cent to 49.6 per cent; and
The average waiting time for semi‑urgent and non‑urgent patients decreased from 144 minutes to 120 minutes.


The latest statistics of A&Es indicate that the fees and charges reform for public healthcare can effectively help the ""acute"" patients among the ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients who are most in need. Resources of A&Es are now better directed towards critical and emergency patients. Directing some non-urgent patients or patients with other medical needs to seek more appropriate healthcare services other than A&Es can also help reduce the overall waiting time and alleviate overcrowding at A&Es, thereby achieving the original intent of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare to concentrate resources and treat patients with urgent medical needs more effectively, as well as improving the clinical environment at A&Es.

(2), (4) and (5) As an essential component of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare, the HA has concurrently expanded its medical fee waiver mechanism. In addition to the some 600 000 people who have been benefiting from medical fee waivers both before and after the reform (including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above and Level 0 Voucher Holders of the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly), the number of other eligible low-income individuals is estimated to significantly increase from approximately 300 000 to about 1.4 million, i.e. an additional 1.1 million low-income individuals can potentially benefit. This enables limited healthcare resources to be more precisely directed to help the ""poor"" patients among the ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients who are most in need, while ensuring that no patient is denied medical care due to lack of means.

Since the implementation of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare, the number of medical fee waiver applications approved by the HA has significantly increased by multiple times compared with the past. As at January 25, 2026, less than one month since the fees and charges reform, the HA has approved 107 865 medical fee waiver applications (including 104 365 full waivers and 3 500 partial waivers). This figure far exceeded the annual number of approximately 14 000 patients who were approved to receive medical fee waivers in the past. In other words, at least an additional of over 93 000 patients to date have already benefitted from the safety net under the enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism, from having to pay the fees and charges in full before the reform to now receiving fee waivers, demonstrating that the reform has effectively strengthened support for low-income families and underprivileged groups. Recent data show that the HA receives an average of about 4 800 medical fee waiver applications per day, down from the peak of over 5 900 applications per day.

Public hospitals have deployed additional manpower, including service ambassadors, designated teams and volunteers, to assist with arrangements such as answering patient inquiries, triaging and processing the medical fee waiver applications. According to approval records at various designated service units, the application process could be completed for most cases within the same day. So far on average approximately 82 per cent of applications were successfully approved on the same day of application, with some hospital clusters reaching over 90 per cent. Medical fee waiver certificates for these cases were issued on the same day.

To facilitate eligible patients in obtaining medical fee waiver certificates before their appointments, the HA advises patients to begin the application process approximately one to two months before their scheduled appointments. The HA is accordingly now accepting applications for medical fee waivers from patients with scheduled appointments within two months. Citizens with scheduled appointments beyond two months or without any appointments do not need to apply pre-maturely at this stage.

Currently, public officers from the HA or the Social Welfare Department are authorised to approve applications for medical fee waivers. Upon assessment, the HA is of the view that such an arrangement is sufficient to handle the existing demand for such applications. As the handling of medical fee waiver applications involves personal data, financial circumstances, medical records and health conditions of patients and their family members, and concerns the use of public fund, utmost care and caution must be exercised. District Health Centres (DHCs) are operated by various non-governmental organisations, with different missions and service scopes. There is no need at this stage to consider utilising DHCs for processing medical fee waiver applications.

(3) The medical fee waiver mechanism aims to provide assistance to patients with financial difficulties and healthcare needs, ensuring they are not denied medical care due to lack of means. Financial assessment is therefore required and, as a matter of fact, not everyone will be eligible. The HA must handle each application with due diligence for proper use of public funds. Patients also have the responsibility to provide complete, accurate, truthful and appropriate information for assessment and verification to help ensure that assistance reaches patients truly in need. While ensuring that no patient is denied medical care due to lack of means, it is also essential for the HA to uphold the principle of prudent use of resources to prevent the limited and precious public resources from being abused.

Medical fee waiver applications are assessed on a household basis. In general, patients and the family members included in the means test are required to submit documents including proof of identity, proof of residence, proof of income and proof of asset. The number of documents required for each application varies depending on factors such as the number of family members and the financial and asset situation of the patient and that of the family members included in the means test. For example, applicants with multiple bank accounts or more complex asset structure and distribution may need to submit more documents. In general, those who have financial difficulty and are eligible for medical fee waivers are from low-income families with relatively simple asset structure. The assessment process for those persons is not complicated.

Apart from expanding the medical fee waiver mechanism to assist the ""poor"" patients among the ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients who are most in need, all additional resources generated from the fee and charges reform for public healthcare will be wholly utilised to enhance public healthcare services. This includes increasing support for the ""serious"" and ""critical"" patients of the ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients, such as introducing a cap on fees and charges at $10,000 to provide an additional layer of protection for patients with multiple chronic or severe illnesses requiring long-term hospitalisation or frequent hospital services. Concurrently, the HA will continue expanding the HA Drug Formulary to include new cost-effective drugs and increase subsidies for standard medical devices and consumables. The Government will also include safe and effective innovative drugs and medical devices into the safety net, providing additional financial assistance through the Samaritan Fund to patients who are unable to afford expensive treatments.

(6) To handle the additional medical fee waiver applications, the HA has adopted special flexible arrangements during the transition period from January to March 2026 to provide ""conditional waivers"" for full or partial medical fees for patients with financial difficulty who require immediate or urgent medical services but are unable to provide the required documentation for financial assessment. Such patients need only sign a declaration form and state their approximate financial circumstances to be granted a ""conditional waiver"" for full or partial medical fees valid for three months, allowing immediate access to fee reduction. This ensures that no patient is denied adequate medical care due to lack of means. As at January 25, 2026, among the 107 865 medical fee waiver applications approved, 56 862 are ""conditional waivers"".

Eligible patients need to submit relevant documents within three months to receive official medical fee waiver certificates upon passing the assessment. If patients fail to submit the required documents within the three-month deadline or do not meet the relevant eligibility criteria, they will be required to settle all applicable fees (if any). To ensure the appropriate use and prevent abuse of healthcare resources, the HA will conduct regular random reviews of approved cases.

The HA will closely monitor the application situation of medical fee waivers and review the transitional arrangements.

(7) Under the medical fee waiver mechanism after the implementation of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare, the maximum validity period of fee waivers will be extended from 12 to 18 months, reducing the number of times patients need to re-apply. To further facilitate the public, the HA will reduce the need for repeated verification of patients' income and asset information. For re-applications within a maximum period of 18 months, patients will only be required to sign a declaration confirming that there is no change to their household financial situation, without having to re-submit financial documents for assessment.

As aforementioned, the medical fee waiver mechanism aims to provide assistance to patients with financial difficulties and healthcare needs, ensuring they are not denied adequate medical care due to lack of means. Whether a patient is required to re‑apply upon the expiry of the waiver period depends on the patient's prevailing medical needs and financial circumstances. Patients may refer to the validity period indicated on the medical fee waiver certificate and review their financial situation and medical needs upon expiry of the validity period to decide whether a further application is required prior to their next appointment.

As the medical fee waiver mechanism involves the use of public fund, patients have the responsibility to provide complete, accurate, truthful and appropriate information for the HA's assessment and verification to ensure that assistance reaches those truly in need. In the event of any changes in the financial or family circumstances of the patients' household following the submission of an application or declaration, and during the validity period of the medical fee waiver certificate, which may affect the eligibility for medical fee waiver, patients must forthwith inform the HA and provide all relevant information for re‑assessment of their eligibility.

To ensure the integrity of the medical fee assistance system and prevent abuse, the HA will conduct regular reviews of approved cases. This includes both the aforementioned cases where re-assessment is required due to changes in the financial or family circumstances of the patient's household, as well as re-application cases within 18 months where no financial assessment is required upon the patient signing a declaration confirming no change in their household financial situation.

(8) Under sections 4 and 18 of the Hospital Authority Ordinance (Cap. 113), the HA shall recommend to the Secretary for Health appropriate policies on fees for the use of hospital services by the public, having regard to the principle that no person should be prevented, through lack of means, from obtaining adequate medical treatment. The Secretary for Health may give directions to the HA in relation to the exercise of its powers concerning the determination of fees, and the HA shall comply with those directions. Fees determined under section 18 shall be published in the Gazette. The Government and the HA have been actively engaging stakeholders on the fees and charges reform for public healthcare, and are committed to enhancing transparency. Since the announcement of the proposal for the fees and charges reform on March 25, 2025, the Health Bureau (HHB) and the HA have, in addition to briefing the Legislative Council Panel on Health Services in April 2025, proactively met with various political groups, professional bodies, healthcare personnel, patient groups and relevant advisory bodies to provide detailed explanations and exchange views. The authorities also held District Council briefings in April and December 2025 respectively, and produced dedicated webpages, information kits, videos and publicity materials to help the public understand the new arrangements. Furthermore, the HHB and the HA will conduct a review every two years on the implementation and effectiveness of the fees and charges reform and monitor the progress of the reform in accordance with the established mechanism. The Government currently has no plan to amend the provisions of the Hospital Authority Ordinance (Cap. 113) in relation to the arrangements regarding fees for hospital services."
​立法會：運輸及物流局副局長就「優化白石角交通網絡及社區設施」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2026-01-28 17:10,2026-01-28 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800553.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局副局長廖振新今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上就李梓敬議員動議的「優化白石角交通網絡及社區設施」議案的總結發言：

代主席：

我非常感謝李梓敬議員提出的議案，以及陳克勤議員、范駿華議員、梁子穎議員的修正案，並感謝十多位議員在剛才的辯論中提出寶貴意見。就有關白石角站和相關交通議題，我就此作出回應。

運輸及物流局一直和發展局緊密合作，與港鐵公司（香港鐵路有限公司）積極跟進白石角新鐵路站和附近土地發展建議。新鐵路站的規劃一直按計劃同步進行，維持在二○三三年或之前開通的目標。我們和港鐵公司會適時就新鐵路站的鐵路方案進行諮詢。過程中亦會與相關持份者保持溝通，仔細聆聽有關新鐵路站和相關接駁設施的建議和意見。

我們非常理解議員和市民的意見，希望新鐵路站盡快落成，為白石角一帶提供直接和便捷的鐵路服務。

新鐵路站涉及在現有東鐵線上進行工程，具有一定挑戰性。根據港鐵公司的初步評估，新鐵路站工程包括建造月台、調整現有高空電纜及供電系統的設備、路軌及渡線軌道、機電系統、安裝月台幕門，以及於現有鐵路旁進行測試和檢測工作等。

不少工程只能於晚上鐵路停止服務後的非行車時段內進行，並須確保能夠按時恢復東鐵線的正常服務。施工期間亦須考慮東鐵線沿線的恆常維修及其他同時進行的工程項目，以及協調列車調度工作，因此每晚可作施工的非行車時間非常有限，大約只有兩小時。此外，白石角一帶有不少現有的民居，在夜間進行工程時亦須顧及環保相關法例的要求，以及採用適當的施工方法，以減低對居民的影響。

經考慮相關技術限制和其他於運作中鐵路線上興建新鐵路站的經驗，我們現時以二○三三年或之前開通為目標。在詳細設計階段以至施工階段，我們會要求港鐵公司積極研究，盡量考慮採用新建築技術加快工程進度，例如裝配式建築設計、組裝合成建築法等。

港鐵公司於二○二四年三月和八月起，分別加強東鐵線的列車服務，包括平日非繁忙時間，以及周末和假日的列車服務，本地和跨境旅客均有所受惠。政府和港鐵公司會繼續密切留意東鐵線的乘客需求，而港鐵公司會按實際營運情況、乘客量分布和變化等因素，適時調整列車服務。

港鐵公司亦會採取不同措施，多管齊下疏導人流，例如在較繁忙的車站加插短途列車疏導乘客、加強車站月台管理以協助列車開出、提供「車廂載客情況」資訊引導乘客前往較多空間的月台位置上車，讓客量分布更均勻等。

政府會繼續督促港鐵公司因應社區發展、地區人口增長、社區規劃、增建車站等轉變，適時檢視並按需要增加列車班次及數目，繼續為社區提供安全可靠、高效的鐵路服務。

路面交通情況方面，現時白石角一帶的居民主要利用創新路、科學園路及澤祥街迴旋處等出入大埔、沙田及市區。運輸署留意到創新路／科城路路口以及澤祥街迴旋處於繁忙時段較為車多，但整體運作仍然暢順。

政府會考慮不同的交通改善方案，包括透過改善路口工程優化區內交通。政府已有計劃於創新路／科城路路口進行擴闊工程，以及重新分配該路口的綠燈時間，以縮短車龍，提升路口表現。

此外，正在推展的T4號主幹路會提供一條雙程雙線分隔行車道，將沙田路接駁至城門隧道公路及青沙公路，使車輛可直接來往馬鞍山及荃灣／西九龍，無須繞經區內的道路。T4號主幹路落成後，途經澤祥街迴旋處的車流預計會減少，該處交通情況將得到明顯改善。

沙田繞道是《香港主要運輸基建發展藍圖》規劃框架下遠期主要幹道網絡的其中一部分，預計通車後能分流新界東北的交通，為新界東北往返九龍提供吐露港公路以外的選擇。我們明白公眾對盡快落實各項主要運輸基建的期望。如《藍圖》指出，政府須平衡各項因素，包括嚴格審視個別項目對政府的財政影響及對社會的經濟效益，以務實地釐訂各基建項目的優次，並按實際情況考慮最適切的推展安排及時間表。

白石角一帶泊車位供應方面，政府目前關於泊車位的政策，是優先照顧和配合商用車輛的泊車需求，並在整體發展容許的情況下，提供適量的私家車泊車位，但不希望誘使慣常乘搭公共交通工具的市民轉用私家車出行，以免加大路面交通的負荷。

就白石角而言，運輸署一直積極於區內透過短期租約增設路旁泊車位，當中更有一個短期租約停車場──科城路停車場，成功引入多層自動泊車系統以增加泊車位。另外，運輸署亦計劃於優景里停車場增設私家車及電單車泊位，並同時於優景里增設中型及重型貨車夜間泊位。

運輸署會繼續按照《香港規劃標準與準則》，要求新發展項目遵照已提升的商用車輛泊車位及上落貨區標準及私家車泊車位標準。

路面公共交通服務方面，現時白石角和科學園一帶共有27條專營巴士路線及10條專線小巴路線提供服務往返大埔區內其他地點，以至港九新界各區，包括沙田、北區、將軍澳、荃灣、屯門、元朗、油尖旺、觀塘、灣仔及機場等。運輸署一直與相關部門就白石角及香港科學園的發展及基建的進展和有關規劃數據保持溝通，緊密監察附近一帶的公共交通需求。運輸署會因應預計乘客需求，與公共交通營辦商適當調整或加強白石角一帶的公共交通服務，包括按需要調整現有服務的班次、營運時間及走線，或引入新服務等。因應大埔區議會的意見，運輸署在過去兩年亦多次提升白石角和科學園一帶的公共交通服務。

港鐵公司就白石角興建新鐵路站和發展附近土地所進行的技術評估，亦會檢視設置新公共運輸交匯處的需要和合適的地點，包括考慮與新鐵路站的連接。

我再次感謝各位議員對白石角發展和新鐵路站的關注。運輸及物流局會繼續和發展局齊心協力，與港鐵公司積極推進項目，並盡早落成啓用新鐵路站。多謝主席。"
TCU's third quarterly report of 2025 released,2026-01-28 17:05,2026-01-28 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800249.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Transport Advisory Committee:

The Transport Complaints Unit (TCU) of the Transport Advisory Committee received 11 842 complaints and suggestions in the third quarter of 2025, with 346 being pure suggestions.

The complaints and suggestions received during the quarter were mostly related to public transport services (89 per cent), enforcement matters (8 per cent) and traffic conditions (3 per cent).

The number of cases on public transport services increased from 9 384 in the previous quarter to 10 519 this quarter, while that on illegal parking and other enforcement matters increased from 743 to 905. The number of complaints and suggestions on traffic conditions increased from 249 to 299 and those on road maintenance increased from 36 to 57.

Exchange Fund Position at end-December 2025,2026-01-28 17:00,2026-01-28 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800478.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (January 28) published the unaudited financial position of the Exchange Fund at end-December 2025.

The Exchange Fund recorded an investment income of HK$331.0 billion in 2025. The main components were:


gains on bonds of HK$142.2 billion;
gains on Hong Kong equities of HK$33.9 billion;
gains on other equities of HK$74.1 billion;
positive currency translation effect of HK$38.4billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets (Note 1); and
gains on other investments of HK$42.4 billion (Note 2).


Fees on placements by the Fiscal Reserves and placements by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government funds and statutory bodies were HK$16.5 billion (Note 3) and HK$14.7 billion respectively in 2025, with the rate of fee payment at 4.4 per cent for 2025.

The Abridged Balance Sheet shows that the total assets of the Exchange Fund increased by HK$70.4 billion, from HK$4,081.0 billion at the end of 2024 to HK$4,151.4 billion at the end of 2025. Accumulated surplus stood at HK$936.1 billion at end-December 2025.

The Exchange Fund recorded an investment return of 8.0 per cent in 2025 (Note 4). Specifically, the Investment Portfolio achieved a rate of return of 12.4 per cent and the Backing Portfolio gained 5.2 per cent. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP) recorded an annualised internal rate of return of 11.2 per cent since its inception in 2009 up to the end of September 2025.

Commenting on the performance of the Exchange Fund in 2025, the Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, said, ""The global financial markets experienced significant volatility in the first half of 2025 due to factors such as trade conflicts and geopolitical tensions. In particular, following the announcement of a series of tariff measures by the US Government in early April, global equity and bond markets fell sharply. As we entered the second half of the year, the investment environment improved notably, bolstered by the smaller-than-expected impact from trade conflicts as well as the swift advancement of artificial intelligence technology which attracted investment flows. Policy rate cuts by major central banks during the year also helped boost market sentiment.

  ""Overall, the global financial markets showed strong resilience in 2025. Major stock markets saw broad-based gains, with many of them setting record highs. The S&P 500 finished the year up 16 per cent. Benefitting from capital inflows into the Hong Kong stock market, the Hang Seng Index rose by 28 per cent in 2025. The US Treasuries also performed decently on the back of the US Federal Reserve's rate cuts. On foreign exchange, the US dollar depreciated by approximately 9 per cent against other major currencies.

  ""Against this backdrop, the Exchange Fund's investment income in 2025 was a record high. Its bond and equity holdings, and the LTGP all achieved positive returns. The Exchange Fund also registered a positive currency translation effect on its non-Hong Kong dollar assets due to the weakening of the US dollar.

  ""It is exceptional for all main components of the Exchange Fund to record positive returns in a single year. This has occurred only two times over the past 15 years in 2017 and 2020. In addition, the investment of the Exchange Fund entails costs and expenses, such as fees on placements by the Fiscal Reserves and by the HKSAR Government funds and statutory bodies, as well as interest payment on Exchange Fund Bills and Notes and other expenses.""

Mr Yue said, ""The exceptional confluence of multiple favourable factors in the global financial markets in 2025 may not last for a long time. Looking ahead to 2026, factors such as global economic conditions, monetary policies of major central banks, developments in artificial intelligence, and geopolitical conflicts could affect the performance of financial markets. Should market conditions deteriorate, the financial markets could fluctuate significantly.

  ""In the face of the complex and volatile investment environment, the HKMA will continue to adhere to the principle of capital preservation first while maintaining long-term growth. We will continue to manage the Exchange Fund with prudence and flexibility, implement appropriate defensive measures, and maintain a high degree of liquidity. We will also continue our investment diversification to strive for higher long-term returns, and ensure that the Exchange Fund remains effective in achieving its purpose of maintaining monetary and financial stability of Hong Kong.""

Note 1: This is primarily the effect of translating foreign currency assets into Hong Kong dollar after deducting the portion for currency hedging.
Note 2: This is the valuation change of investments held by investment holding subsidiaries of the Exchange Fund. This figure reflects the valuations at the end of September 2025. Valuation changes of these investments from October to December are not yet available.
Note 3: This does not include the 2025 fee payment to the Future Fund because such amount will only be published when the composite rate for 2025 is available.
Note 4: This return excludes the performance of the Strategic Portfolio and only includes the performance of LTGP up to the end of September 2025. The audited full year return will be published in the 2025 annual report."
TAC briefed on Government's proposal to enhance requirements for physical fitness certification of driving licence applicants and holders,2026-01-28 17:00,2026-01-28 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800288.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Transport Advisory Committee:

The Transport Advisory Committee (TAC) was briefed today (January 28) by the Government on the proposal to enhance the requirements for physical fitness certification of driving licence applicants and holders.

The Government attaches great importance to road safety and the physical fitness of drivers. In light of the ageing population and the increasing number of aged commercial vehicle (CV) drivers, the Transport Department (TD) reviewed the physical fitness certification requirements and mechanism, and put forth enhancement measures to further safeguard road safety.

At the meeting, the Government outlined the legislative proposals to tighten the medical fitness requirements. These include (1) enhancing physical fitness requirements by updating the diseases and physical disabilities prohibiting driving, with updated vision standards and additional items applicable to CV drivers; (2) more stringent certification for CV drivers by lowering the age threshold for submitting medical examination certificates from 70 to 65 and shortening the full driving licence validity period to one year to necessitate annual medical check-ups; and (3) empowering the Commissioner for Transport to require reports from any driver with dubious health conditions, with non-compliance potentially resulting in licence cancellation or suspension.

Members were also briefed of the Government's preparatory work in taking forward the proposed measures, including formulation of a comprehensive set of medical guidelines and new medical examination certificates, and the refinement thereof after considering the views of various stakeholders and the feedback collected from the trial health assessment.

  The TAC Chairman, Professor Wong Sze-chun, said, ""Members noted with appreciation the Government's comprehensive review and expressed views on the legislative amendment proposals. We support the Government's direction to adopt a more stringent physical fitness certification requirement for aged CV drivers, including lowering the age threshold to 65 and requiring annual check-ups. A more robust assessment mechanism is essential for enhancing road safety. The more frequent check-ups will raise CV drivers' awareness of their own physical conditions, and facilitate early treatment for those with remediable conditions, thereby extending the safe driving years of aged drivers and supporting the sustainable operation of the industry. Members fully support the Government in moving forward with the legislative amendments and stepping up publicity to ensure the industry is well-prepared for the new requirements.""

The Government will continue with the work and plans to report to the Panel on Transport of the Legislative Council (LegCo) the results of the trial and the legislative proposal in the first quarter of this year, and submit the subsidiary legislation amendments to the LegCo with a view to implementing the new arrangements as soon as possible following the completion of the legislative amendments."

外匯基金截至二○二五年十二月底的財務狀況,2026-01-28 17:00,2026-01-28 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800468.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（一月二十八日）公布外匯基金截至二○二五年十二月底未經審計的財務狀況。

外匯基金在二○二五年錄得3,310億港元的投資收入，其主要組成部分包括:


債券投資收益1,422億港元；
香港股票投資收益339億港元；
其他股票投資收益741億港元；
非港元資產外匯估值上調（註一）384億港元；及
其他投資收益（註二）424億港元。


二○二五年外匯基金支付予財政儲備存款與香港特別行政區政府基金及法定組織存款的息率為4.4%，二○二五年相關費用分別為165億港元（註三）及147億港元。

外匯基金資產負債表摘要顯示，外匯基金的總資產增加704億港元，由二○二四年底的40,810億港元，增加至二○二五年底的41,514億港元。於二○二五年十二月底，外匯基金累計盈餘為9,361億港元。

二○二五年外匯基金的投資回報率為8.0%（註四），其中「投資組合」回報率為12.4%，而「支持組合」為5.2%。「長期增長組合」自二○○九年開展投資至二○二五年9月底的年率化內部回報率為11.2%。

金管局總裁余偉文評論外匯基金在二○二五年的表現時表示：「環球金融市場在二○二五年上半年受貿易摩擦和地緣政治局勢等影響出現明顯波動，特別是美國政府於四月初宣布一系列關稅措施後，全球股市和債市皆曾急劇下挫。踏入下半年，隨着貿易摩擦的影響較預期小，加上人工智能技術快速發展帶動資本投入等因素，投資環境顯著改善。主要央行於年內調低政策利率，亦有助提升市場氣氛。
  
全年而言，環球金融市場表現強韌。主要股票市場普遍上升，並於年內創紀錄新高，其中美國標普500指數全年上升16%；香港股市受惠於資金流入，恒生指數全年上升28%。美國國債在美聯儲減息的環境下，全年亦有不俗的表現。匯市方面，美元兌其他主要貨幣貶值約9%。
  
在此背景下，外匯基金於二○二五年錄得歷年最高的投資收入，其股票、債券以及『長期增長組合』均實現正回報。美元走弱同樣為外匯基金的非港元資產帶來外匯估值上調。

外匯基金各主要組成部分同時錄得正回報的情況非常特殊，在過去15年來只曾於二○一七年和二○二○年出現。而外匯基金的投資亦涉及成本和支出，例如支付予財政儲備存款、政府基金和法定組織存款的費用，以及外匯基金票據及債券利息和其他支出等。」

余偉文表示：「二○二五年全球市場出現多項利好因素疊加的特殊情況未必能長期持續。展望二○二六年，環球經濟狀況、主要央行的貨幣政策、人工智能的發展和地緣政治衝突等因素都可能影響金融市場的表現。如情況轉差，金融市場或會出現較大波動。

面對複雜多變的投資環境，金管局會繼續堅守『保本先行、長期增值』的原則，謹慎而靈活地管理外匯基金。我們會作出適當的防禦性部署，並維持高流動性，亦會持續多元化投資，致力提高外匯基金的長期投資回報，確保外匯基金能繼續有效維持香港的貨幣及金融穩定。」

註一：主要為外幣資產在扣除匯率對沖部分後換算至港元所產生的估值變動。
註二：這是外匯基金投資控股附屬公司持有的投資的估值變動。有關數字反映二○二五年九月底的估值，尚未包括十至十二月份的估值變動。
註三：未包括二○二五年度應支付予未來基金的款項。有關數字需待二○二五年的綜合息率確定後方可公布。
註四：有關回報率不包括策略性資產組合的表現，並只反映長期增長組合截至二○二五年九月底的表現。經審計的全年回報率將於二○二五年年報中公布。"
​交諮會聽取政府簡介有關提升駕駛執照申請人及持有人體格證明要求的建議,2026-01-28 17:00,2026-01-28 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800286.htm,"下稿代交通諮詢委員會發出：

交通諮詢委員會（交諮會）今日（一月二十八日）聽取政府簡介有關提升駕駛執照申請人及持有人體格證明要求的建議。

政府十分重視道路安全及駕駛者的身體狀況。鑑於人口高齡化及年長商用車輛司機人數上升，運輸署就體格證明要求及相關機制進行檢討，並提出一系列優化措施，以進一步保障道路安全。

在會議上，政府概述提升體格要求的法例修訂建議，包括：（一）提升體格要求，修訂禁止駕駛的疾病及身體傷殘項目，加強視覺要求，並就商用車輛司機增設適用項目；（二）對商用車輛司機設定較嚴謹的體格證明要求，把提交體格證明的年齡門檻由七十歲降至六十五歲，並將正式駕駛執照的有效期縮短至一年，即相關司機須每年接受體格檢驗；及（三）賦權運輸署署長在懷疑駕駛人士體格出現狀況時，可要求他們提交醫療報告，如不遵從可取消或暫時吊銷其駕駛執照。

委員亦聽取政府為落實相關建議所進行的籌備工作，包括制訂一套詳細醫療指引及新體格檢驗證明書，並在考慮各相關持份者的意見及就體格評估試驗計劃所收集的意見後加以完善。

交諮會主席黃仕進教授說：「委員欣悉政府進行的全面檢討，並就相關法例修訂建議表達意見。我們支持政府就年長商用車輛司機設定較嚴謹體格證明要求的方向，包括將年齡門檻降至六十五歲及要求一年一檢。更穩健的評估機制對提升道路安全非常重要；更頻繁的體格檢查亦可鼓勵商用車輛司機更關注自身健康情況，有助司機及早就可治療的身體狀況接受治療，從而延長年長司機的安全駕駛年期，有助業界的可持續運作。委員全力支持政府推展有關法例修訂工作及加強宣傳，確保業界為新要求作好準備。」

政府會繼續推展相關工作，計劃於今年第一季向立法會交通事務委員會匯報試驗計劃的成果及立法建議，並會向立法會提交有關的附屬法例修訂，以期在完成法例修訂後盡快實施新安排。"

立法會八題：公營房屋的滲水問題,2026-01-28 16:54,2026-01-28 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800343.htm,"以下是今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上何敬康議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

據報近年有不少公共屋邨、居者有其屋計劃（居屋）及綠表置居計劃（綠置居）屋苑的住戶反映，其單位出現滲水或漏水問題，而相關政府部門跟進及處理有關問題時成效不彰，申訴專員公署亦不止一次就有關政府部門處理滲水問題的程序展開主動調查。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年房屋署接獲多少宗涉及其轄下房屋單位（包括新入伙並已交樓的居屋及綠置居屋苑單位）滲水或漏水的個案，以及當中已成功處理、仍在處理及未能處理的個案數目及比例分別為何；未能處理個案的具體原因為何；

（二）在第（一）項所述的滲水或漏水個案中，有多少個涉及的單位在出租或出售前已存在滲水問題；該等單位的主要滲水源頭，以及房屋署所採取的解決方案為何；

（三）鑑於房屋署在出租或出售單位前，會進行修繕及／或翻新工程，該署就驗收有關滲漏改善工程的標準為何，以及如何確保單位在交付給租戶或買家前，相關滲水問題已有效解決；

（四）據悉滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處（滲水辦）現時以滲水位置濕度為35%或以上作為立案調查的參考標準之一，但有滲水單位的居民反映，房屋署與滲水辦所使用的濕度測量儀器、檢測方法及標準並不一致，導致兩個部門檢測的結果不同，政府會否檢討並統一相關檢測工具與標準，例如考慮要求房屋署使用與滲水辦相同或更精準的儀器及方法，以提升檢測成效；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）當局現時有何具體措施，預防樓齡較高或結構老化的公營房屋單位出現滲水問題？

答覆:

主席：

就何敬康議員的提問，我們現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）香港房屋委員會（房委會）一直致力為市民提供具質素的公營房屋。房委會十分關注公營房屋單位出現滲水或漏水的情況，在單位出租或出售之前，會仔細進行修繕及翻新工程，並在交樓前再作檢查。在每個新建工程項目完成前，房委會的地盤監督小組會就住宅大廈的工程項目進行詳細檢查、測試及驗收。對於個別單位發現的瑕疵，房委會亦會督導承建商按照既定程序積極進行相關的修繕工作。並於每個項目設立「入伙大使」，專責協助居民處理一切有關入伙事宜，當中包括跟進修繕工作進度，就每個需要跟進的修繕項目，協助居民覆檢至符合標準且得到業主或住戶確認為止。

房委會的工程合約經理會利用承建商表現評分制對承建商的品質表現作出評核，該評分制評核範圍包括物料及施工的質量。承建商表現評分制中取得的整體分數會影響有關承建商日後參與投標的機會，從而有效對承建商施加壓力，促使他們做好工作。未來我們會持續檢視收貨流程及標準，以及建築工程規範的要求，並利用科技加強品質監控，以提升公營房屋的品質。

如有公共租住房屋（公屋）租戶反映其單位有滲水或漏水情況，房屋署的目標是在接獲租戶通知後三個工作天內安排上門檢查。檢查由工程人員進行，並配合使用濕度探測及紅外線成像等儀器，以準確辨識滲水源頭，包括牆身、防水層或在牆身內的喉管等。一般情況下，工程可於進入單位後約一星期內完成；實際時間則取決於個案的複雜程度及各方合作情況。若個案涉及上、下層協調、喉管更換或需搭建棚架等，則需額外時間安排。

二○二三年至二○二五年期間，房屋署共接獲有關已出租公屋單位滲水或漏水的個案宗數表列如下﹕

​截至二○二五年仍在處理的個案中，419宗為二○二五年十一月之後接收的個案，主要涉及有關戶主未能配合安排檢測或維修時間，當中並無長期未能處理的個案。超過六成個案來自樓齡30年以上的舊屋邨，滲漏源頭多為浴室地台或牆身，成因主要包括防水層老化、建築物料自然損耗或租戶自行裝修期間損壞防水層或喉管等。房委會一般會為受影響位置重鋪防水層，以徹底根治滲漏問題。房屋署會繼續積極協調檢測或維修的安排，並透過執管措施推動個案順利完成。

此外，為順利處理有關滲水或漏水事宜，房屋署會對拒絶配合檢測或維修的公屋租戶執行屋邨管理扣分制。根據屋邨管理扣分制，不讓房委會或其授權的人士於其居住單位進行滲漏檢查或施工會被扣七分。過去三年，房屋署曾因此對21個公屋租戶扣分。

資助出售單位方面，過去三年共有約23000個單位入伙。房委會收到當中500多個單位（約佔百分之二）的住戶報告，要求協助跟進的漏水或滲水執修的個案數量表列如下：

​上述所有有關資助出售單位的個案，大多牽涉輕微事項，例如在建築期殘留在窗框邊的沙石或調較窗鉸鬆緊而影響窗框的密封性，導致在風雨下有輕微滲漏等，並未發現嚴重情況，而所有個案均已處理。因需要執修的項目比較輕微，超過九成的個案可以在確定安排入屋修繕起計七日內完成執修，其餘個別個案基本上亦會於14日內完成。

（三）及（四）房委會一向注重公營房屋的建屋質素，並有一套嚴謹的機制監察承建商的施工質量。房屋署發布的《建築工程規格資料庫》規定了新發展工程合約的建築物料及造工規格、測試方法和驗收標準。房委會要求承建商在交付前，須按已認可的品質標準，並按照合約條款就工程質素及建築物料的規定完成工程。對於所有新落成的公營房屋單位，房屋署會於室外對窗戶進行加壓噴水測試，於室內對廁所的防水區域進行模擬淋浴的灑水測試。而針對近期受關注的穿牆喉管套通滲水問題，我們在原有的驗收程序中，加入穿牆喉管套通的外部加壓噴水測試及完工交付前的抽樣檢查，另外亦為每個項目的穿牆喉管套通進行額外抽樣，詳細檢查套通周圍的填料是否填滿，以加強質量核查，從而杜絕滲水個案。

房屋署亦一直嚴格監管修繕及翻新工程。房屋署在收回公屋單位後，工程人員會翻查該單位的過往維修紀錄，並到單位進行檢查，以安排適當的維修工作；如發現收回的公屋單位有滲漏情況，工程人員會在檢查單位後，在單位內進行適當維修工程，並在完成工程後進行驗收，以確定單位滲漏情況已獲妥善處理。此外，工程人員亦會在翻新工程進行期間，在場監督關鍵性工序，包括塗刷防水層以確定全面覆蓋相關範圍、進行水密性測試。所有維修工程在完工後均須通過驗收方可出租予公屋申請人。

目前，市場上存在多種濕度測量儀器，各自涵蓋不同的應用範圍、標準規範及誤差容限等參數，房屋署以「預防性維修」及「製造商技術標準」為基礎，着重維持樓宇結構安全及住戶居住環境質素，因此濕度讀數即使未到高水平，房屋署便會開始主動展開進一步檢查及維修，以盡早防止滲水問題惡化。由於觸發行動的門檻較低，反應便會更快，使我們能夠更早進行修復，更好地維護居住環境，此做法更能有效提升滲水處理的速度和質量，亦更符合我們的住戶期望。

（五）自二○○六年起，房屋署一直於公屋單位致力執行「全方位維修計劃」（維修計劃），主動勘察樓齡達10年或以上的屋邨單位室內狀況，藉以提升住戶的居住環境質素，同時優化房委會資產質素和延長其使用年期。維修計劃下，房屋署會主動查找有需要的維修問題，並推廣及教育家居維修保養的知識。維修計劃有助公屋單位得到妥善維修保養，從而減少日後出現滲漏的情況。針對高樓齡屋邨的維修需要，房委會為樓齡介乎10至30年的屋邨，每十年安排一次室內勘察；而樓齡超過30年的屋邨，則每五年一次。維修計劃涵蓋公屋單位內所有由房委會提供的標準設施。

如果公屋租戶有日常維修需要，可以透過「日常家居維修服務」聯絡屋邨辦事處，屋邨辦事處會安排職員上門檢查及適時維修。

我們明白屋邨會隨樓齡增加而老化，未來相關的維修成本亦會變得越來越重。就此，房委會積極規劃舊屋邨的重建計劃。房委會目前正積極進行12個重建計劃，涵蓋不同階段，包括研究、規劃及工程階段，未來會繼續按其政策和四個基本原則，即樓宇的結構狀況、修葺工程的成本效益、是否有合適的遷置資源，以及原址重建的潛力，按實際情況審慎考慮是否重建個別屋邨。"
LCQ8: Water seepage problems in public housing,2026-01-28 16:54,2026-01-28 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800345.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Adrian Ho and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (January 28):

Question:

 It has been reported that in recent years, many residents in public housing estates, Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) courts and Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) courts have relayed that water seepage or leakage problems have occurred in their units, but relevant government departments have been ineffective in following up on and handling the problems, and the Office of The Ombudsman has more than once launched direct investigations into the government departments' procedures for handling water seepage problems. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of cases received by the Housing Department (HD) in each of the past three years involving water seepage or leakage in housing units under the HD (including newly-occupied and handed-over units in HOS and GSH courts), and among them, the respective numbers and proportions of cases which were successfully handled, remained under processing and could not be handled; the specific reasons why the cases could not be handled;

(2) among the units involved in the water seepage or leakage cases mentioned in (1), of the number of units in which the water seepage problems had already existed before the units were rented out or sold; the main sources of water seepage in such units, and the solutions adopted by the HD;

(3) given that the HD carries out repair and/or refurbishment works before renting out or selling its units, of the HD's acceptance standards for the related water seepage or leakage rectification works, and how it ensures that the water seepage problems have been effectively resolved before the units are handed over to tenants or purchasers;

(4) it is learnt that the Joint Office for Investigation of Water Seepage Complaints (JO) currently uses the moisture content level of 35 per cent or above at a seepage area as one of the reference criteria for initiating investigations, but some residents of units with water seepage have relayed that the HD and JO have used different moisture content measuring instruments, testing methods and standards, leading to discrepancy between the two departments' test results, whether the Government will review and align such testing tools and standards, such as considering requiring that the instruments and methods used by the HD should be the same as or more precise than those used by JO, so as to enhance testing effectiveness; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) of the specific measures currently put in place by the authorities to prevent water seepage problems in older and structurally aged public housing units?

Reply:

President,

In response to the question raised by the Hon Adrian Ho, our reply is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) is committed to providing quality public housing for citizens. The HKHA is highly concerned about water seepage or leakage issues in public housing units. Before the units are let or sold, the HKHA will conduct thorough repair and refurbishment works as well as final inspections prior to handover. Prior to the completion of each new construction project, the HKHA's Site Supervision Teams will conduct detailed inspections, tests and acceptance checks on domestic building works. Where defects are identified in individual units, the HKHA will oversee contractors to actively undertake relevant repair works in accordance with the established procedures. An intake ambassador is appointed for each project to assist residents with all matters related to moving in, including the monitoring of progress of repair works and assistance in re-inspecting each repair item until standards are met to the satisfaction of the property owner or resident.

The HKHA's project contract managers will assess contractors' quality of work and performance through the Performance Assessment Scoring System, which evaluates aspects including quality of materials and workmanship. A contractor's future tender bidding opportunities hinge on the overall score it achieved under the system, thereby effectively pressing the contractors to deliver high quality of work. Moving forward, we will continue to review our acceptance procedures and standards as well as construction specifications, and leverage technology to step up quality control, thereby enhancing the quality of public housing.

Should tenants of public rental housing (PRH) report water seepage or leakage in their units, the HD aims to arrange an on-site inspection within three working days of receiving the notification. Inspections are conducted by engineering staff using equipment such as moisture metres and infrared imaging to accurately identify the source of seepage, such as walls, waterproofing layers, or pipes within walls. Generally, repairs can be completed within approximately one week of entering the unit; while the actual time required depends on the complexity of the case and the co-operation of all parties involved. Additional time is required if the case involves co-ordination with neighbouring units above or below, pipe replacement, or the need for scaffolding.

The number of cases received by the HD concerning water seepage or leakage in rented PRH units during the period from 2023 to 2025 is tabulated as follows:




Year
No. of cases received on water seepage or leakage
No. of cases successfully solved
Number of cases being processed
Number of cases unsolved

Among the cases being processed as of 2025, 419 were received after November2025 and are still being processed mainly because the property owners could not cater inspection arrangements or repair schedules. There are no cases remained unsolved for an extended period of time. Over 60 per cent of the cases were found in estates built over thirty years ago, with the source of leakage most commonly found on bathroom floor surfaces or walls. The primary causes include ageing of waterproofing layers, natural deterioration of building materials, or damage to waterproofing layers or pipes during renovations arranged by tenants. The HKHA will generally re-lay waterproofing layers to affected areas to resolve the issue. The HD will continue to actively co-ordinate inspection and repair arrangements and facilitate successful completion of cases by enforcement measures.

Furthermore, to facilitate the smooth handling of water seepage or leakage issues, the HD will enforce the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement against PRH tenants who refuse to co-operate with inspections or repairs. Under this Scheme, refusal to allow the HKHA or its authorised representatives to conduct leakage inspections or carry out works within their units will incur a deduction of seven points. Over the past three years, the HD has deducted points from 21 PRH tenants for the aforesaid reason.

Regarding Subsidised Sale Flats (SSF), over the past three years, there were intakes to about 23000 units. The HKHA received reports from residents of around 500 units (approximately 2 per cent) requesting assistance with follow-up repairs on water leakage or seepage. The relevant case numbers are tabulated below:




Year

The majority of the aforementioned cases about SSF involved minor issues, such as debris left in window frames during construction or adjustments to window hinges affecting the seal, leading to slight water seepage in winds and rains, etc. No serious problem was found, and all cases were resolved. Given the minor nature of the required repairs, over 90 per cent of the cases were completed within seven days after the arrangement of repairs was confirmed. The remaining individual cases were basically completed within 14days.

(3) and (4) The HKHA has always placed great emphasis on the construction quality of public housing and maintains a rigorous system for monitoring contractors' workmanship. The Specification Library issued by the HD stipulates the building materials and workmanship specifications; testing methods; and acceptance standards under new development works contracts. The HKHA requires contractors to complete works in accordance with approved quality standards and contractual provisions regarding workmanship and building materials prior to handover. For all newly completed public housing units, the HD conducts watertightness tests on windows by nozzles with pressure from the outside, as well as simulated shower spray tests on waterproof areas in bathrooms. In response to recent concerns about water seepage through pipe sleeves penetrating walls, we have enhanced the existing acceptance procedures by adding watertightness tests by nozzles with pressure for pipe sleeves and random inspections prior to project completion and handover. Furthermore, additional random inspections are conducted on pipe sleeves for each project to thoroughly inspect whether the packing around the sleeves is fully filled, thereby strengthening quality control and eradicating instances of water seepage.

The HD has consistently maintained rigorous monitoring of repair and refurbishment works. Upon repossession of PRH units, the HD's engineering staff review the units' maintenance records and conduct on-site inspections to arrange appropriate repairs. Should water seepage be identified in a repossessed unit, engineers will undertake necessary repair works upon inspections. Upon completion of the repair works, acceptance checks are performed to ensure that the leakage issue has been properly resolved. Furthermore, during refurbishment works, engineers supervise critical processes on-site, including the application of waterproof coatings to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant areas and conduct watertightness tests. All repair works must pass inspection checks before the unit will be let to PRH applicants.

Currently, various moisture metres are available in the market, each with different parameters such as application scope, standard, and error tolerance. The HD prioritises ""preventive maintenance"" and ""manufacturer technical standards"" to maintain structural safety and the quality of residents' living environments. Consequently, even when humidity readings do not reach high levels, the HD will proactively initiate further inspections and repairs to prevent water seepage issues from worsening at an early stage. This lowers the threshold for triggering actions and enables swifter responses, allowing us to undertake repairs earlier and better maintain the living environment. This approach effectively enhances the speed and quality in addressing water seepage, and it also better fulfils residents' expectations.

(5) Since 2006, the HD has actively implemented the Total Maintenance Scheme in PRH units to proactively assesses the interior condition of units in estates aged 10 years or above, thereby enhancing residents' living environment while optimising the quality and service life of the HKHA's assets. Under the scheme, the HD proactively identifies necessary maintenance issues and promotes knowledge on home maintenance. The scheme facilitates proper maintenance of PRH units so as to reduce future instances of water seepage. With a view to addressing the maintenance needs of older estates, the HKHA arranges indoor inspections every ten years for estates aged between 10 and 30 years, and every five years for those aged over 30 years. The scheme covers all standard facilities within PRH units under the HKHA.

Should PRH tenants have a need for daily maintenance, they may contact estate offices via the Responsive In-flat Maintenance Services. Estate offices will arrange staff to conduct on-site inspections and carry out timely repairs.

We recognise that estates will age, and the associated maintenance costs will become higher with time in future. In response, the HKHA is actively planning redevelopment projects for older estates. The HKHA is currently actively pursuing 12 redevelopment projects at various stages, including research, planning and construction phases. In future, the HKHA will continue to carefully consider redevelopment plans for individual estates based on actual circumstances and in accordance with its policy and four fundamental principles, namely the structural condition of the buildings, the cost-effectiveness of repair works, the availability of suitable rehousing resources, and the potential for redevelopment at the original site."
立法會︰發展局局長就「優化白石角交通網絡及社區設施」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-28 16:53,2026-01-28 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800481.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（一月二十八日）在立法會會議上就「優化白石角交通網絡及社區設施」議員議案的開場發言全文：

主席：

我首先感謝李梓敬議員提出議案，以及陳克勤議員、范駿華議員及梁子穎議員提出修正案。在其他議員表達意見之前，我希望首先講講政府在白石角研究興建鐵路站和進行發展的政策背景，以及我們與運輸及物流局（運物局）以及香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）攜手合作推展這個研究的最新進展，好讓各位議員接下來可以有更深入討論。

白石角綜合發展的政策背景

首先是政策背景。政府於二○二一年《施政報告》宣布為興建東鐵線白石角站及附近的綜合發展進行研究。政府亦邀請了港鐵公司進行這項研究，因為考慮到正正在運作中的鐵路興建一個站，鐵路公司有專業知識處理這項研究。及後，我們在二○二二年《施政報告》進一步表示會研究以二○三三年或之前開通白石角站為目標。

從政策定位方面，我希望各位議員及公眾都明白到，這個項目不是單純「加一個車站」般簡單的項目，而是一個綜合發展的項目，而是正正希望達到多個政策目標。

首先，作為香港科技基礎設施的旗艦，科學園位於白石角吐露港沿岸，佔地約22公頃。自開園以來，科學園一直透過提供國際級創科設施，推動香港成為全球創新科研樞紐。科學園近年致力提升園內設施，例如創新斗室，以吸引創科人才，但的確園區的對外交通連接仍待改善。在此背景下，我們有需要透過鐵路接駁改善園區的對外交通基建，將科學園納入鐵路版圖，這除了便利現時約20 000名於科學園的工作人口外，亦提升科學園的吸引力。

​另一個目標關乎重置教育大學運動中心到本部校園附近。現時，由教育大學本部校園駕車到教大白石角的運動中心需時超過15分鐘。透過重置運動中心並優化當中的體育設施，我們希望既惠及學生的學習體驗，亦可呼應政府促進香港成為國際高等教育樞紐的政策。

第三個目標關乎如何善用重置教大運動中心後釋出的土地。原有運動場用地連同附近適合作住宅發展的用地，可為區內提供更多房屋和議員所關心的配套設施，例如商鋪、行人連接設施、公共運輸交匯處等等。我們亦希望借助房屋發展的機會，善用公私營合作，提供有用的社區設施。

事實上，現時居住於白石角的人口約有24 000人。如計及擬議房屋發展帶來的新增人口後，除了建議中的白石角站以外，的確需要更多的交通配套，完善區內的公共交通網絡。總結發言時，運物局副局長會向大家闡述未來區內各項有關交通的改善措施和工程。

最新進展

我們理解，自以上綜合發展公布以來，我們做研究，不少持份者，包括當區居民、科學園和其創科人員等，都普遍期待白石角站能盡快動工、盡快啓用。

政府和港鐵確實用了較多時間研究這項目，因為當中要克服不少挑戰。首先，要在東鐵線這條營運中的鐵路加建車站殊不簡單，廖副局長（運物局副局長廖振新）稍後會向大家解釋技術困難，但我想指出要在有限時間和有限土地空間，即一條正在營運中的鐵路線再建設一個車站，會拉高工程造價。另外，我們考慮的造價還包括搬遷教大運動場，以及新運動場所在的用地亦需要政府徵收私人土地。我們亦要因應新的發展提升包括食水、污水等基建設施以支持發展。考慮到政府正在同步推行多項土地發展及基建項目，包括北都多個項目，我們的確需要考慮善用市場力量，以協助承擔我剛才所說的各項費用，所以我們現時正探討如何善用白石角教大運動場搬遷後釋出的土地興建私營住宅，而透過私營住宅的發展權支付我剛才所說各個部分的造價。

事實上，考慮到現時原有社區都是以私營住宅為主，我們認為在釋出的用地興建私營住宅亦有其合理性。不過由於白石角住宅發展須在運動場搬遷後才能啓動，其落成時間會是較長遠，起碼10年以外。而視乎進一步分析我剛才所說的成本，我們有可能需要在白石角區域以外再多覓土地興建房屋，透過釋出更多物業發展權，為鐵路站、重置運動場及其他基建設施的成本提供財務支撐。

我們會盡早完成現時正密鑼緊鼓進行、比較複雜的成本分析及財務分析，希望於今年內盡早公布這個綜合發展的具體建議，目前我們仍然以二○三三年或之前開通白石角站為目標。

總結

接下來的時間，我們歡迎議員就今日的辯論提出寶貴的意見，集思廣益。稍後我和運物局副局長會就議員意見再作回應。多謝主席。"
衞生署嚴肅跟進一宗懷疑未經授權閱覽醫療紀錄個案,2026-01-28 16:50,2026-01-28 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/28/P2026012800467.htm,"衞生署今日（一月二十八日）表示，一名按非公務員聘用條款聘用的合約實習牙科醫生懷疑未經授權閱覽他人的醫療紀錄，署方已轉介執法部門進行刑事調查。若證實有違法違規行為，衞生署會按既定程序嚴肅跟進。

衞生署早前接獲電子健康紀錄申請及諮詢中心轉介一名市民的查詢，關注為何其最近在未有使用衞生署服務的情況下，收到短訊指出其醫健通紀錄被衞生署醫護人員閱覽。衞生署即時展開調查，初步發現一名合約實習牙科醫生曾多次在未經授權下，透過學童牙科診所的臨床醫療信息管理系統及醫健通擅自閱覽並非其病人的醫療紀錄，共涉及16人，涉事的合約實習牙科醫生報稱該16名病人是其認識的。

衞生署已向個人資料私隱專員公署、電子健康紀錄專員和香港牙醫管理委員會（牙管會）報告事件，並已通知受影響的人士。有關合約實習牙科醫生已被暫停職務。

根據《牙醫註冊條例》（第156章），本地牙科畢業生須經過實習才可在香港正式註冊。引入實習要求，旨在讓本地牙科畢業生加強於實際工作場景的臨床經驗，從中熟習香港的執業情況，並增進與病人溝通的技巧，以確保他們除了掌握專業知識外，亦具備純熟手藝及專業態度，能在不同狀況下作出臨床判斷，有效應付執業牙醫的工作需要。

衞生署為實習牙科醫生安排為期兩星期的入職培訓時，已向他們清楚講解必須嚴格遵守的專業操守和行為守則，而在實習期內由香港大學牙醫學院為實習牙科醫生定期安排的專業發展課程內容亦涵蓋牙醫應有的專業責任及道德操守，以及保障病人的個人資料的相關法例。因應今次事件，香港大學牙醫學院將會加強牙科學生及實習牙科醫生在資訊科技安全方面的相關培訓。

為避免同類事件再次發生，衞生署將會檢討及優化現有的内部系統安全措施，並已督促所有員工及醫護人員，必須嚴格遵守衞生署制定的資訊科技保安及醫護人員使用醫健通的內部指引，確保他們充分理解保障病人個人資料的重要性。

根據衞生署制定的內部指引，醫護人員在取覽病人的電子健康紀錄時必須注意保護病人私隱及遵守相關法例，包括《電子健康系統條例》（第625章）。同時，醫護人員必須在獲得病人的同意，並符合「有需要知道（Need to Know）」及「病人正接受其護理（Patient Under Care）」的原則下，才可取覽載於任何衞生署的臨床醫療信息管理系統及醫健通内的醫療紀錄。有關指引與醫健通所頒布的實務守則一致，並規定所有醫護人員在申請醫健通戶口前必須細閱指引，並於申請表格上簽署確認已經了解及會遵守相關規定。同時，所有取覽醫健通所載的電子健康紀錄的活動均會被記錄，以供核查，有效防範濫用。

衞生署一直十分重視僱員（包括合約員工）的品行操守，有既定機制規管員工的行為及紀律。如懷疑員工涉及不當行為，署方會嚴肅調查和秉公處理。"
