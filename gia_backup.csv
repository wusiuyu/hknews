主席：

感謝劉國勳議員的議案，以及陳月明議員和周文港議員的修正議案，就「動態規劃及整合土地，加快北都大學教育城發展」提出意見和建議。

教育是強國建設、民族復興之基。二十大報告提出，到二○三五年建成教育強國的目標。國家主席習近平亦在二○二四年九月在全國教育大會上發表重要講話，為國家未來的教育發展提供了清晰及有系統的發展方針。建設教育強國，龍頭是高等教育。在「一國兩制」獨特的制度優勢之下，香港整體教育競爭力在全球排名第二，高等教育高度國際化和多元化，擁有五所世界百強大學，並在最新公布的二○二六年QS（Quacquarelli Symonds）世界大學排名中再創佳績，尤其在學術影響力、研究水平及國際化方面表現卓越。

行政長官在二○二三年《施政報告》提出要建設香港成為「國際教育樞紐，未來人才搖籃」。就此，政府正推展一系列的具體措施，包括提升政府資助的專上院校非本地學生限額，增加「一帶一路獎學金」的名額及逐步增加香港博士研究生獎學金計劃名額等。二○二四年《施政報告》進一步提出政府將致力打造「留學香港」品牌，在推動本地人才培育之餘，吸引優秀的學生和學者來港升學和工作。

在二○二三年公布的《北部都會區行動綱領》之中，政府提出發展「北都大學教育城」（大學城），為專上教育界別提供擴容提質的發展空間。大學城是鞏固香港作為國際教育樞紐的重要建設之一，亦創造空間讓香港的學術及研究在國際發展更上一層樓。大學城將全面配合北部都會區的產業導向發展原則，推進教育科技人才融合發展，推動國際高端人才集聚香港。

另一方面，政府亦繼續積極推動自資與公帑資助專上教育界別的並行發展，鼓勵自資院校進一步利用北部都會區的種種優勢發掘和建立更多有特色的專精範疇，以自負盈虧模式開辦課程，靈活回應社會不同界別不斷轉變的人力需求，為年青人提供多元的升學出路。

就劉議員提出就大學城項目發展進行意向調查，政府正正希望透過集思廣益，探索大學城的最佳發展方向和模式。教育局於二○二三年六月舉辦簡介會向各專上院校，包括大學教資會（大學教育資助委員會）資助大學、職業訓練局及自資專上院校，介紹北部都會區的專上教育用地，並諮詢各院校的初步發展意向及建議。

其後，我們在二○二三年八月邀請有興趣就北部都會區專上教育建設提出意見的院校提交簡略的建議書及作簡介，以及雙向交流。當中，有19所專上院校參與是次諮詢活動及提交建議書。

剛才發展局局長甯漢豪已向大家闡釋了北部都會區的整體規劃綱要及發展進度。現在，我會重點介紹大學城的發展規劃情況，回應議員的議案及修正案。現時，政府在北部都會區內的洪水橋／厦村新發展區、牛潭尾新發展區及新界北新市鎮已預留約90公頃土地，發展大學城。配合北部都會區「產業帶動，基建先行」的概念，專上教育院校在區內將主要以自資模式發展，與中外知名院校以靈活創新的方式，開拓更多品牌課程、研究合作和交流項目，透過區內共享資源和產業聯動提升協同效應，吸引更多海外學術及研究人才來港；同時抓緊國家高速發展的機遇，發揮香港所長，貢獻國家所需。

就議員對大學城用地提出的建議，我想指出土地是珍貴的社會資源。在為北部都會區的專上教育作整體布局及規劃時，我們參考了相關院校早前就大學城發展提交的初步意向，並以實事求是的態度及穩健發展為基礎。綜合考慮各項因素及發展優次，政府已經將大學城用地由最初的約60公頃增加至現時的約90公頃，以配合專上教育界的需求。

我們現正與相關政策局和部門商討預留土地的具體位置、面積、用途及密度等規劃事宜。為提升成本效益和不同院校間的協同效應，在規劃時我們將進一步探討闢設一些供不同院校共用的特別設施和其他附屬設施，例如數據中心、學生宿舍等，並遵循以下四個目標與策略逐步推展相關工作，包括：

（一）產業導向；
（二）支持香港發展成為國際專上教育樞紐；
（三）配合國家發展戰略；以及
（四）產業帶動，按部就班。

在規劃過程中，我們會審慎考慮所有因素，包括可行性、成本效益、如何善用現有的校園設施和公共資源等。教育局會繼續與有興趣參與發展的院校保持聯繫，以考慮推展有關項目的實際安排。在考慮「北都大學教育城」的發展方案時，我們會擇優而取，確保進駐院校可配合大學城的策略及區域發展定位。教育局計劃在二○二六年上半年或更早的時間盡快公布《北都大學教育城概念發展綱要》。

接下來，我和發展局局長會仔細聆聽各位議員的意見。我們會在辯論之後發言，回應大家的建議。

多謝主席。"
立法會︰發展局局長就「動態規劃及整合土地，加快北都大學教育城發展」動議議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-09 20:11,2025-07-09 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900811.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上就「動態規劃及整合土地，加快北都大學教育城發展」動議議案的開場發言全文：

主席：

首先，我感謝劉國勳議員提出這項動議辯論，亦多謝陳月明議員和周文港議員提出的修正案，讓政府特別是我作為發展局局長和教育局局長蔡若蓮，今日有機會聆聽各位議員對加快發展北都大學教育城的想法和建議。

北都（北部都會區）對香港社會和經濟發展至關重要，對香港與大灣區其他城市發展高質量合作，以至更好融入國家發展大局，意義重大。我們一直都說，北都的規劃以「產業帶動」，提供約3 000多公頃新發展土地，推動不同產業，當中這些產業包括專上教育產業的多元發展。

自行政長官在二○二三年《施政報告》提出《北部都會區行動綱領》以來，我們就北都大學教育城先後發表了一些規劃建議，並一直與教育局協作，在土地規劃和造地方面作出部署。我們目前已經在洪水橋／厦村新發展區、牛潭尾新發展區及新界北新市鎮合共預留約90公頃土地，發展北都大學教育城，推動香港成為國際專上教育樞紐，打造「留學香港」品牌。

當中洪水橋大學城用地面積約為五公頃。正如剛才議員提到，洪水橋／厦村新發展區「走得比較前」一點。我們現已制定法定城規圖則，所以有關土地最早可於明年內完成平整，供發展大學之用。用地亦位於洪水橋新發展區市中心，鄰近未來屯馬綫洪水橋站及港深西部鐵路洪水橋總站，交通可以說是非常便捷。

至於牛潭尾和新界北新市鎮，根據我們去年底公布的發展建議，兩個新發展區現時規劃作大學城的用地面積分別約為46公頃及40公頃。正如陳月明議員剛才所建議，該兩個大學城的定位應要盡量配合其周邊的產業定位，發揮聯動效能、相得益彰的效果。牛潭尾既然位處北都的創新科技地帶，鄰近新田科技城及當中的河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區，所以牛潭尾有關的大學城用地設有大型的綜合醫教研醫院及第三所醫學院，再加上大學用地。至於新界北新市鎮，因應區內發展口岸經濟，以及現代物流、綠色產業、先進建造業和先進製造業和其他新興產業，該處的大學城地帶具備條件推動院校與區內產業協同發展，並善用該區與深圳緊密聯繫的優勢，加強兩地教育交流合作。

我們已於今年年初就牛潭尾和新界北新市鎮的土地用途建議進行了為期兩個月的公眾參與活動。我們正分析所收集到的意見，並很快會制訂建議發展大綱圖，進行《環境影響評估條例》下的環境影響評估，以及進行工程詳細設計。我們在完成法定城規程序後，會在這兩個新發展區優先開發屬於大學城的用地。我們現時計劃預計牛潭尾由政府主導的土地平整工程，最早可於二○二七年展開，首批大學城用地最早可於二○二九年完成平整；而新界北新市鎮的大學城用地，已納入該區的「優先發展區」內，按現時初步時間表，政府主導的土地平整工程最早可於二○二八／二九年展開，首批大學城用地最早可於二○三○／三一年完成平整。我們亦會參考教育局和院校的需求後，探討進一步提速的空間。事實上有一點是值得強調的，在我們規劃和造地的同時，教育局正同步制定「北都大學教育城概念發展綱要」。用地分配工作亦可在此階段進行，無須等待用地完成平整，以便獲分配用地的院校可提前作好準備，例如院校亦需要籌集資金、進行校園設計和招募教學和其他人員等，所以待土地完成平整後，院校可以馬上進場，開展他們的建造工程。

劉國勳議員提出的議案和大家的修正案其中一個建議，是增加洪水橋預留作大學城的用地。事實上，我們整體在三個新發展區預留的大學城用地，已由最初的約60公頃，增加至現時的約90公頃。就洪水橋而言，整個新發展區有多項產業定位，包括現代物流、專業服務和專上教育等，分別預留了合適用地；亦預留了用地作房屋和社區設施用途，並正如我剛才提到，較早前已完成了法定規劃，但其實規劃必定是一個動態過程，我們秉持開放態度，在着眼社會整體利益，平衡各方需要下，樂意考慮不同建議，包括探討是否有空間進一步擴大洪水橋用地內預留作大學城用地的面積。

主席，我期望先聆聽各位議員的具體想法和建議，稍後再作詳細回應。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
男子非法管有本地野生及瀕危龜隻被判入獄二十個月,2025-07-09 19:26,2025-07-09 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900834.htm,"​一名本地男子因非法管有本地野生及瀕危龜隻，今日（七月九日）在區域法院被裁定罪名成立及判處監禁二十個月。此案為漁農自然護理署（漁護署）首次引用《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章），成功向法庭申請就非法管有瀕危物種的控罪加重刑罰。

漁護署發言人表示，該名四十三歲男子活躍於網上社交平台專頁及通訊軟件群組，不時在網上發放有關捕捉野生動物的帖文，並透過群組出售來源不明的受管制物種。漁護署與警方在二○二三年七月採取聯合行動，在其大埔區住所內檢獲29隻瀕危龜隻，包括14隻屬《瀕危野生動植物種國際貿易公約》（《公約》）附錄I的大頭龜、屬《公約》附錄II的兩隻黃緣閉殼龜、四隻馬來閉殼龜、兩隻亞洲巨龜及四隻山瑞鱉，以及三隻屬《公約》附錄III的烏龜。所有物種均屬《國際自然保護聯盟瀕危物種紅色名錄》的瀕危或極度瀕危物種，在本港均受《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》（第586章）管制。當中所有大頭龜經專業科學鑑證後，證實為源自本地野外，受《野生動物保護條例》（第170章）保護。

漁護署以非法管有附錄I及附錄II瀕危物種及非法管有在本港取得的活生受保護野生動物共三項控罪檢控該名男子。該男子今日在區域法院被裁定罪名成立。漁護署根據《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》向法庭申請加重刑罰。法庭接納有關申請，並將刑期增加四分之一，判處被告即時監禁二十個月。

發言人說：「非法管有瀕危物種屬嚴重罪行。任何人士若干犯《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》，一經定罪，最高可被罰款1,000萬元及監禁十年，有關物品亦會在定罪後被充公。此外，《野生動物保護條例》亦訂明任何人未經許可，不得狩獵、故意干擾、購買、售賣、輸出、要約出售或要約輸出、管有或控制受保護野生動物（包括所有野生龜鱉）。違者一經定罪，最高可被罰款十萬元及監禁一年。」

發言人表示，政府致力打擊非法野生動物的狩獵及貿易，以保護本地野生及瀕危物種。漁護署會保持警覺，繼續監察不同平台及社交媒體的有關信息並積極採取執法行動，打擊非法買賣瀕危物種。

Man sentenced to 20 months' imprisonment for illegal possession of local wild and endangered turtles,2025-07-09 19:26,2025-07-09 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900832.htm,"âA local man was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 20 months at the District Court today (July 9) for illegal possession of local wild and endangered turtles. The case marks the first time that the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has successfully applied to the court under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) for enhanced sentencing for the charge of illegal possession of endangered species.

A spokesman for the AFCD said that the offender was active on social media platforms and instant messenger groups, posting messages about poaching wild animals online and offering regulated species of unknown origin for sale through these groups. In July 2023, the AFCD and the Police mounted a joint operation and seized 29 endangered turtles from the offender's residential premises in Tai Po District, including 14 big-headed turtles (Platysternon megacephalum) listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I; two yellow-margined box turtles (Cuora flavomarginata), four Southeast Asian box turtles (Cuora amboinensis), two giant Asian pond turtles (Heosemys grandis) and four wattle-necked softshell turtles (Palea steindachneri), listed in CITES Appendix II; and three Reeve's turtles (Mauremys reevesii) listed in CITES Appendix III. All the turtles are listed as ""Endangered"" or ""Critically Endangered"" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, and regulated under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance (Cap. 586). Scientific testing confirmed that all seized big-headed turtles were taken from the wild in Hong Kong and are protected under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance (Cap. 170).

The man was prosecuted on three charges for illegal possession of Appendix I and Appendix II endangered species, as well as illegal possession of live protected wild animals taken in Hong Kong. The offender was convicted today at the District Court. The AFCD applied to the court for an enhanced sentence under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance. The application was accepted by the court, and the sentence was increased by 25 per cent. The defendant was sentenced to immediate imprisonment for 20 months.

The spokesman added, ""Illegal possession of endangered species is a serious offence. Any person who contravenes the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance is liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years, and the specimens will also be forfeited upon conviction. In addition, the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance also stipulates that unless otherwise permitted, no one shall hunt, wilfully disturb, buy, sell, export, offer for sale or export, possess or control protected wild animals (including all wild chelonians). Offenders are liable to a maximum fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year upon conviction.""

The spokesman added that the Government is committed to combating illegal hunting of and trading in wild animals to protect local wild species and endangered species. The AFCD will remain vigilant and continue to monitor information on various platforms and social media, and proactively take enforcement action against illegal trade in endangered species.

Members of the public may call 1823 to report any suspected irregularities to the AFCD and visit the AFCD website at www.cites.hk regarding the control of endangered species in Hong Kong."
立法會二題︰提高學生的家鄉和祖籍意識,2025-07-09 19:25,2025-07-09 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900812.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上劉智鵬議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

問題：

據報每年清明節均有大批市民攜同子女北上祭祖，探訪祖籍家鄉。關於提高學生的家鄉和祖籍意識，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府於二○二二年回覆本人質詢時表示，會就在中小學及幼稚園學生學籍表上重置「籍貫」一欄的建議，留意社會各界的意見及作出跟進，有關工作的進展為何，包括會否明確規定學生須填寫正確的籍貫資料；如會，具體推行時間表為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）教育局會否考慮根據學生的籍貫，加入「尋根尋源」的教學元素，以提高他們的家鄉和祖籍意識；如會，具體計劃為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為政府的「同鄉文化推廣計劃」下的活動均由同鄉社團籌辦，難以涵蓋學生層面，政府會否考慮推出以學生為對象的同鄉文化活動；如會，具體計劃為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

教育局非常重視培養同學的國家觀念，鼓勵學校以「多重進路、互相配合」的方式，通過「有機結合」、「自然連繫」多元化學生活動，推行國民教育，幫助學生認識香港與內地同根同源，同時，在香港中小學課程中，加入相關的學習元素，例如在小學人文科包含認識家族成員、姓氏、籍貫、家鄉等概念，幫助他們了解家鄉的歷史和發展，從而提高他們的祖籍意識，培養鄉土情懷，同鄉情誼。初中歷史科包含認識本地不同華人團體，包括同鄉會發展等課題，讓學生了解有關團體的服務及貢獻，弘揚慈惠和鄉鄰互助的美德。

「慎終追遠，不忘其根」，「親情」和「孝悌」是中華文化重要的價值觀。提高學生對家鄉及祖籍的認識，有助從小培養學生對中華文化和國民身分認同，以及對國家的歸屬感。

事實上，現時不少中小學生對籍貫或家族背景、歷史的認識，不單從學校教育、課堂學習而來，更多的是生活體驗，例如剛才議員提到的祭祖、回鄉探親、家庭聚會、回鄉旅行等。除了學校舉辦的多元學習活動，例如家鄉美食分享、「尋根之旅」等，香港不少辦學團體和學校亦以同鄉會或家鄉命名，學生對「籍貫」鄉情並不陌生。

就劉智鵬議員的提問，重點回覆如下：

（一）及（二）社會上對要求學生在學生手冊個人資料欄中，必須填報「籍貫」，仍有不同觀點和看法。有意見認為要求學生在學籍表個人資料中填報「籍貫」，可以幫助進行籍貫教育，培養學生家國情懷。同時亦有意見指出，學籍表中的「籍貫」欄屬個人資料，學校收集時要符合《私隱條例》（《個人資料（私隱）條例》）要求，闡明收集目的，而資料收集亦必須適度和對應目標。據了解，目前已有愈來愈多學校恢復在學籍表中加入「籍貫」一欄。

事實上，通過了解籍貫，學生可以追溯家族歷史，認識不同地域的文化特色，更全面地了解國家乃至世界的多元文化。然而，落實的方法可以因應校情，靈活多變，要求學生在學生手冊個人資料中填報「籍貫」，是方法之一。強行劃一推行，無助提升教學效果。

我們認為要幫助學生認識香港與內地同根同源，必須全方位進行。結合中小學課程，課堂內外，互相配合，效果更佳，例如在小學人文科課程，涵蓋有關姓氏、籍貫和家鄉等學習內容，教師結合「尋根尋源」的學習元素，啓發學生深入認識自己的籍貫，提高對家鄉和祖籍的瞭解，對家鄉的風景名勝和特產有所認識，學會關注家鄉的發展和變化。

學校以「多重進路」的方式，融入相關學習元素是值得推廣的做法。最近在小學人文科的教師專業研討會中，就有老師以「我的家人：認識姓氏、籍貫與家鄉」為課題作公開課堂，分享教學心得。學校結合姊妹學校、學生內地交流計劃，選擇以學生家鄉為目的地，讓同學連繫生活學習國情，這些做法亦很常見。

學校在學生學籍表上設「籍貫」一欄，幫助老師了解學生的背景和需要，設計合適的學習活動，更好地照顧學生多樣性，提升學與教成效，亦是有效的做法。

然而，我們亦理解有部分學校由於不同原因，例如持份者對個人資料收集看法不同、不適用於少數族裔學生等，而未有劃一要求在學籍表加入「籍貫」一欄。

教育局理解校情不一，不會硬性要求所有中、小學及幼稚園劃一在學籍表加上「籍貫」一欄。香港社會多元共融，校園亦有不同族裔的學生一起學習，不同文化互相交流，彼此尊重。因此我們鼓勵學校與持份者多溝通，爭取家長的理解和支持。同時，多管齊下，做好「籍貫」教育，幫助學生對血緣鄉情的認知，認識自身文化根源，培養對不同地域文化的尊重和理解。

（三）就加深巿民對其家鄉的認識及歸屬感，弘揚愛國、愛港、愛鄉的精神，行政長官在二○二三年《施政報告》推出「同鄉文化推廣計劃」（推廣計劃），為期三年，予同鄉社團申請資助，用作舉辦推廣家鄉文化和傳承、團結在港鄉親，以及促進兩地交流的活動。資助項目的活動形式不限，只要性質為非牟利並符合推廣計劃的目標。申請資助的同鄉社團亦可按其需要與其他活動籌辦單位，包括學校，商討合作。以首年度推廣計劃的獲資助申請項目為例，香港廣東社團總會在去年底舉辦的「廣東非遺入校園」活動，在不同中小學舉辦文化體驗工作坊，近一千名學生及家長受惠。

總括而言，要培養學生的家國情懷，我們必須以課堂內外互相結合的方式，通過多重進路，互相配合，既結合課程亦要連繫生活。「籍貫」教育是重要一環。而要提高學生的家鄉和祖籍意識，不限於學校教育，更涉及公眾教育、家庭教育，以至社會氛圍等各方面的工作配合，同時有賴整個社會不同持份者同心同德，共同推進。香港特區政府的不同部門，包括民政及青年事務局、教育局，會繼續肩負相關的推動工作，通過聽取不同持份者，包括團體、社區組織、學校、家長等的意見，持續探討可行做法，以凝聚各界共識，營造氛圍，與持份者協力培養年青人「慎終追遠，不忘其根」的精神。

多謝主席。"
LCQ2: Raising students' awareness of their hometowns and ancestral origins,2025-07-09 19:25,2025-07-09 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900819.htm," Following is a question by Professor the Hon Lau Chi-pang and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

It has been reported that every year around Ching Ming Festival, a large number of members of the public travel north with their children to pay tribute to their ancestors and visit their ancestral hometowns. On raising students' awareness of their hometowns and ancestral origins, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in the reply to my question in 2022, the Government has indicated that it would keep in view the suggestions from various sectors of society for follow-up action regarding the suggestion of adding the item on ""native place"" back to the Student Information Form of students of kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, of the progress of the relevant work, including whether it will explicitly require students to fill in the correct information about their native places; if so, of the specific implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the Education Bureau will consider incorporating the element of ""exploring one's roots"" into the teaching according to the students' native places, so as to raise their awareness of their hometowns and ancestral origins; if so, of the specific plans; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that the activities under the Government's Clansmen Culture Promotion Scheme are all organised by clansmen associations, it is difficult for such activities to cover the student level, whether the Government will consider launching clansmen cultural activities targeted at students; if so, of the specific plan; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Education Bureau (EDB) attaches great importance to nurturing students' sense of nationhood, encouraging schools to implement national education through a ""multipronged and co-ordinated"" approach and organising diversified student activities in a manner of ""organic integration and natural connection"", with a view to enhancing students' understanding of the same cultural roots the Mainland and Hong Kong share. A number of related learning elements have been incorporated into the curricula of primary and secondary levels. For instance, Primary Humanities covers the concepts of family members, family names, native places and hometowns, etc. It helps students understand the history and development of their hometowns, so as to enhance their awareness of their ancestral origins and foster the affection for their native places and clansmen. Junior Secondary History includes the topics on the development of various local Chinese organisations, including clansmen associations, to help students learn about the services and contributions of relevant organisations, promoting the virtues of philanthropy and mutual support.

""We treasure our historical legacy and never forget our roots"". Filial piety and fraternal duty are important values in Chinese culture. Enhancing students' understanding to their native places and ancestral origins contributes to cultivation of their inheritance of Chinese culture, national identity and sense of belonging to the country.

In fact, the understanding of nowadays primary and secondary school students on their native places or family backgrounds and histories is not solely derived from school education or classroom learning. It is more shaped by the students' life experiences, such as tomb sweeping and visits to relatives in the hometown as aforementioned, family gatherings, or travelling to hometown, etc. In addition to the diversified learning activities organised by schools, such as hometown cuisine sharing sessions and tours for students to explore their roots, many school sponsoring bodies and schools in Hong Kong are named after clansmen associations or hometowns. As a result, students are generally familiar with the concept of ""native places"" and the sentiments associated with it.

Our reply to the question raised by Professor the Hon Lau Chi-pang is as follows:

(1) and (2) There are still different opinions and views in society on requiring students to fill in their ""native place"" in the personal information column of the student handbook. Some believe that requiring students to fill in their ""native place"" in the personal information on the Student Information Form is conducive to ""native place"" education and cultivating students' affection for home and country. At the same time, some pointed out that the ""native place"" column in the Student Information Form is a type of personal information. When collecting the data, schools must comply with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, clearly stating the purpose of collection. Data collection must also be appropriate and commensurate with the objectives. It is learnt that more and more schools have resumed adding the ""native place"" column to the Student Information Form currently.

In fact, by understanding their native places, students can trace their family histories, learn about the cultural characteristics of different regions, and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the country, as well as the multicultural nature of the world. However, the implementation strategies can be flexible and varied according to the school situation. Requiring students to report their ""native places"" in the personal information section of the student handbook is just one such way. Enforcing a unified and mandatory implementation method would not contribute to increasing the effectiveness of learning and teaching.

To enhance students' understanding of the same cultural roots the Mainland and Hong Kong share, it is considered that the implementation strategies should be comprehensive. A more effective approach would be integrating the curricula of secondary and primary schools for students to learn within and beyond the classroom in a co-ordinated way. For instance, the Primary Humanities curriculum covers the learning content of family names, native places, hometowns, etc. Teachers incorporate the learning element of ""exploring one's roots"" to inspire students to gain a deeper understanding of their native places, and deepen their understanding of their hometowns and ancestral origins. This also enables students to acquire knowledge of the scenic spots and specialty products of their hometowns, learning to show concern over the development and changes in their hometowns.

Schools incorporating related learning element in a multipronged way is a practice worth promoting. For example, at the teacher professional conference of the Primary Humanities recently, teachers shared their open lessons titled ""My Family: Learn About Family Names, Native Places and Hometowns"" and exchanged their experiences. Some schools choose their students' native places as the destinations of sister school exchanges and in the Mainland exchange programmes, so as to allow students to learn about the country's development through life experience. These are common practices.

Some schools include a ""native place"" field in the Student Information Form, which enables teachers to understand the backgrounds and needs of students and devise suitable learning activities to better cater for learner diversity and improve the effectiveness of learning and teaching. This is also an effective practice.

However, we also understand that some schools, for various reasons such as diverse opinion among stakeholders over collection of personal data or inapplicability to ethnic minority students, etc, have not included the ""native place"" field in the Student Information Form.

The EDB understands that school contexts vary and will not rigidly require all secondary schools, primary schools and kindergartens to add the ""native place"" field to the Student Information Form. Hong Kong is a diverse and inclusive society and there are students of different ethnicities studying together in campus. Individuals from different cultural backgrounds engage with and respect on each other. Therefore, we encourage schools to enhance communication with stakeholders to gain parents' understanding and support. At the same time, schools should deliver education on ""native places"" in a multipronged approach, with a view to helping students develop an understanding of their connection to their families and hometowns, recognise their cultural roots, and cultivate respect for and understanding of the cultures of different regions.

(3) To deepen the public's understanding of and sense of belonging to their hometowns, thereby fostering the spirit of loving the country, Hong Kong and their hometowns, the Chief Executive launched in his 2023 Policy Address the
""Clansmen Culture Promotion Scheme"" (the Scheme) for a period of three years, for application by clansmen associations to subsidise their organisation of activities to promote and preserve hometown culture, unite clansmen in Hong Kong and facilitate exchanges between Hong Kong and the Mainland. There is no restriction on the form of the activities, as long as they are non-profit-making in nature and in line with the objectives of the Scheme. Clansmen associations applying for the subsidy may, having regard to their needs, explore collaboration with other event organisers, including schools, in organising the activities. Taking a project approved under the first year of the Scheme as an example, the Federation of Hong Kong Guangdong Community Organisations conducted the ""Guangdong Intangible Cultural Heritage in Schools"" programme at the end of last year to host cultural workshops in various primary and secondary schools. Nearly 1 000 students and parents were engaged.

In conclusion, to cultivate students' sense of belonging to their hometowns, we must adopt a ""multipronged and co-ordinated"" approach that integrates learning within and beyond the classroom, linking curriculum with real-life experiences. Education on ""native places"" is an important element. Enhancing students' awareness of their native places and ancestral origins involves more than school education. It also needs the efforts and co-ordination on all fronts such as public education, family education and even the social atmosphere. It requires the concerted efforts and enhanced collaboration of different stakeholders in society to advance this initiative. Various departments of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, including the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the EDB, will continue to be responsible for the relevant promotional work, and explore practicable measures by listening to the views of different stakeholders, including relevant organisations, community groups, schools and parents, so as to forge a consensus among different sectors and create a conductive atmosphere. We will collaborate closely with various stakeholders to cultivate in the young people the spirit of ""treasuring their historical legacy and never forgetting their roots"".

Thank you, President."
"FS continues visit to Seoul, Korea (with photos/video)",2025-07-09 19:23,2025-07-09 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900802.htm,"The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, continued his visit to Seoul, Korea, today (July 9). He attended a seminar on the development of capital markets in Hong Kong and Korea, as well as a business luncheon cohosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (Tokyo) and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He also held several meetings respectively with the Chairman of the Financial Services Commission of Korea, Mr Kim Byung-hwan, and leaders in the investment sector to exchange views on the landscapes and developments of the financial markets and investment circles, and to promote further collaboration between the two markets.

In the morning, Mr Chan attended and delivered a keynote speech at the Hong Kong-Korea Capital Markets Conference, organised by CSOP Asset Management. Conference participants included the Chairman of the Korea Financial Investment Association, Mr Seo Yoo-seok, as well as representatives from local pension funds, insurance companies, brokerage firms and other institutional investors and financial institutions.

In his speech, Mr Chan highlighted that Hong Kong's financial market has shown strong resilience over the past two years, with continued capital inflows, a robust stock market and a significant increase in bank deposits. Amid profound changes in the global political and economic environment, Hong Kong is regarded as a safe harbour for global capital, characterised by transparent, stable and predictable policies, and its efficient connectivity with China and other Asian markets.

He emphasised that China's technological innovation is advancing rapidly, with more leading-edge Mainland technology companies choosing to list in Hong Kong. International investors are sharing in the dividends of China's technology development through Hong Kong's capital market, presenting opportunities for Korean investors as well. At the same time, Hong Kong is actively enhancing mutual market access with the Mainland and strengthening ties with other financial markets. In the space of exchange-traded products, Hong Kong has attracted participants from around the world. He expressed hope for more reciprocal arrangements with Korea to further deepen co-operation in these areas. Mr Chan also shared Hong Kong's strategies and initiatives in developing digital assets, including licensing regimes for digital asset platforms and stablecoins.

At noon, Mr Chan attended the Korea–Hong Kong Business Luncheon, cohosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (Tokyo) and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The event was attended by over 150 leaders from the financial, commercial, trade, innovation and technology, and tourism sectors. Seoul's Deputy Mayor for Economy, Mr Joo Yong-tae, also attended.

At the luncheon, Mr Chan noted that Hong Kong's economy is steadily recovering after the pandemic, with visitor numbers continuing to increase. In the first half of this year alone, Hong Kong welcomed over half a million Korean visitors, a year-on-year growth of 25 per cent. He also highlighted the sustained confidence of international enterprises in Hong Kong, with the number of foreign and Mainland companies reaching a record high in 2024. The number of Korean companies grew by 9 per cent in particular. Hong Kong ranks among the top three in international financial centres and global competitiveness. Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the city has maintained a safe and stable environment, further strengthening international investors' confidence in doing business in Hong Kong.

Mr Chan also mentioned that Hong Kong serves as the international gateway to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, connecting to a consumer market of about 87 million people. The entire Greater Bay Area is developing into a region with both financial and innovation strengths. For Korean enterprises, Hong Kong's unique advantage of connecting with both the Mainland and the world can create new opportunities in finance, innovation and technology, digital economy, film and entertainment, and more. He welcomed Korean businesses to develop in Hong Kong.

In the afternoon, Mr Chan met with the Chairman of the Financial Services Commission, Mr Kim Byung-hwan, to exchange views on financial development and regulatory issues of mutual interest. He also held discussions with representatives from the Korea Venture Capital Association and the private equity sector to learn about Korea's industry ecosystem and asset allocation strategies, while introducing investment opportunities in Hong Kong across the stock market and the innovation and technology landscape.

Mr Chan will continue his visit to Seoul tomorrow (July 10) and return to Hong Kong in the evening."

"Hong Kong Customs steps up enforcement to combat illicit cigarette telephone-ordering activities and raids suspected ""cheap whites"" storage centre (with photo)",2025-07-09 19:00,2025-07-09 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900810.htm,"Hong Kong Customs has been mounting a territory-wide enforcement operation codenamed ""Thunder"" starting this week to combat illicit cigarette telephone-ordering activities. A suspected storage centre for duty-not-paid cigarettes, commonly known as ""cheap whites"", was shut down yesterday (July 8), and a total of about 1.15 million suspected duty-not-paid ""cheap whites"" with an estimated market value of about $5.2 million and a duty potential of about $3.8 million were seized. One person involved in the case was arrested.

Through risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit cigarette operation in Tsuen Wan yesterday and intercepted a suspicious-looking man in an industrial building. A batch of suspected duty-not-paid ""cheap whites"" was seized from the man's trolley and from two units in the building which were used as a storage centre. The 27-year-old man, who was in charge of the storage centre and claimed to be a salesperson, was subsequently arrested.

After preliminary investigations, Customs believes that illicit cigarette syndicates would distribute the suspected duty-not-paid ""cheap whites"" seizedto the Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing Districts through telephone ordering. The operation has successfully shut down the supply chain in the Districts.

The investigation is ongoing, and the arrested man has been released on bail pending further investigation.

Customs reminds all retailers, including newsstands, convenience stores and grocery stores, that if the department has reasonable suspicion that the cigarettes being sold are duty-not-paid products, regardless of the quantity of cigarettes involved, decisive enforcement actions will be taken. Meanwhile, Customs appeals to retailers not to sell cigarettes from unknown sources. They must ascertain whether the relevant cigarette companies or intermediaries are legal and whether the cigarettes they supply are duty-paid in order to avoid criminal liability.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storages, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities.

Customs stresses that it is an offence to buy or sell illicit cigarettes. Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."
​香港海關加強打擊電購私煙活動並搗破懷疑「白牌煙」倉庫（附圖）,2025-07-09 19:00,2025-07-09 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900809.htm,"香港海關本周起在全港各區展開代號「迅雷」的執法行動，以打擊電話訂購（電購）私煙活動，並於昨日（七月八日）搗破一個懷疑未完稅香煙（俗稱「白牌煙」）貯存倉庫，檢獲約一百一十五萬支懷疑未完稅「白牌煙」，估計市值約五百二十萬元，應課稅值約三百八十萬元，並拘捕一名涉案人士。

海關人員根據風險評估和情報分析，昨日在荃灣進行反私煙行動，在一幢工廈內截查一名可疑男子，於其手推車及該工廈被用作貯存倉庫的兩個單位內檢獲該批懷疑未完稅「白牌煙」，遂拘捕該名負責管理貯存倉庫、報稱售貨員的二十七歲男子。

經初步調查，海關相信私煙集團以電購方式分銷該批懷疑未完稅「白牌煙」到荃灣及葵青區，是次行動成功堵截該兩區的電購私煙供應鏈。

案件仍在調查中，該名被捕男子獲准保釋候查。

海關提醒各零售商，包括報攤、便利店和雜貨店，如海關有合理懷疑所出售的香煙為未完稅，不論涉及的香煙數量多少，定必果斷採取執法行動。同時，海關呼籲各零售商切勿售賣來歷不明的香煙，必須了解相關煙草商或中介公司是否合法以及所供應的香煙是否已完稅，以避免刑事責任。

海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。

海關強調買賣私煙同屬違法。根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
立法會：保安局局長就「研究訂立網絡安全法，建構完善的反網絡詐騙體系」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-09 18:54,2025-07-09 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900765.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（七月九日）在立法會會議就「研究訂立網絡安全法，建構完善的反網絡詐騙體系」議員議案的總結發言：

主席：

我再次感謝邱達根議員提出議案，以及陳克勤議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案，就「研究訂立網絡安全法，建構完善的反網絡詐騙體系」這個重要議題發表意見和提出建議。我亦感謝其他議員提出的寶貴意見。

首先，我想回應一下謝偉俊議員提出，指在打擊網絡詐騙方面，似乎「道高一尺，魔高一丈」、處於被動。雖然我們未必令社會上一宗網絡詐騙都沒有，但我堅信邪不能勝正，只要政府、商界和市民一同攜手合作，必然可應對挑戰。

網絡安全和詐騙範圍廣泛，我們必須要全方位多角度地處理。政府會密切留意詐騙案件的最新趨勢，以及法改會（法律改革委員會）的電腦網絡罪行檢討結果，並透過政府、商界、市民協作，持續完善跨部門和跨境合作平台，並積極加強與各商業夥伴，特別是通訊和金融業界一起保持協作，阻止騙徒利用網絡和銀行戶口犯案，又發出警示提醒大家要提高警覺。警方亦會採取多渠道、「鋪天蓋地」的宣傳策略，並聯同不同民間組織宣揚反詐騙信息，持續向廣大市民以及針對新來港學生、老人和外傭等高風險群體進行反詐騙宣傳。

我現在就剛才議員發言所提及的數個重要範疇作回應。

首先，在香港主要採用不同法例，針對性處理和網絡安全相關的議題，包括網絡詐騙。這做法雖然有別於以一條法例處理所有事情，但我認為在香港的情況更有彈性和更適合。當然，我們會不時檢討如何優化這些法律法規，例如法改會正就有關電腦網絡罪行進行研究，而商務及經濟發展局亦正在檢討與電話卡實名制有關的法例。

有議員提出，要加強電話卡實名登記制度。警方一直與通訊辦（通訊事務管理局辦公室）和電訊商保持緊密聯繫，並按實施以來的經驗要求電訊商持續優化登記平台。正如剛才邱達根議員提及，為加強實名登記制的有效實施，通訊辦已要求電訊商自去年十月起以「智方便iAM Smart」作為香港身份證持有人在實名登記制下的預設登記方式，規定電訊商以人手核查所有非持有香港身份證人士的實名登記紀錄，確保各登記系統有效運作，有效防止騙徒冒認身分。

另外，通訊辦亦要求電訊商加強抽查和查找有可疑的電話儲值卡，並將涉嫌使用假身份證明文件的個案交予警方處理。自實名登記制實施以來，截至今年五月，已有約484萬張電話儲值卡因客戶未能提供合乎登記要求的資料，包括以身份證明文件副本進行登記和填寫的資料與身份證明文件不一致等，而被拒絕登記。另外有約346萬張未能遵從合規要求的電話儲值卡，包括在電訊商進行抽查時未能按照要求進行身分核實和懷疑使用偽冒證件進行登記等，而被取消登記。

通訊局（通訊事務管理局）於二○二三年四月制定《電訊服務供應商管理詐騙電話及詐騙短訊的業務守則》，要求電訊服務供應商監察由其網絡和系統打出的電話或發出的短訊。一旦發現某電話號碼打出電話或發出短訊的模式有可疑，例如在短時間內打出大量電話或發出大量短訊，電訊商就會暫停有關電話號碼的服務。截至今年五月底，約有143萬個本地電話號碼因此被暫停服務。

有議員剛才提到，希望警方能夠進一步加強跨區司法協作。正如我剛才開場發言提到，警方一直積極參與國際合作，例如國際刑警組織、內地和海外的執法機關以及財富情報單位保持緊密合作關係，進行情報交流。例如二○二四年十月，網罪科（網絡安全及科技罪案調查科）和國際刑警組織合辦第十四屆國際刑警組織網絡罪案首長級工作坊，為全球執法機關和企業搭建交流平台，探討共同面對的網絡犯罪挑戰。二○二五年六月，網罪科總警司更獲選為國際刑警組織全球網絡罪案專家組主席，進一步加強與世界各地執法部門的協作，攜手打擊科技罪案，包括網絡電訊詐騙。

我們亦會不時與內地和海外執法機構採取聯合行動。例如開場發言中提及的反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」，就涵蓋10個國家及司法地區。透過強化情報交流和協調行動，共同打擊詐騙、與網絡相關以及洗黑錢的罪行。警方亦與國際刑警組織設立「國際止付機制」，協助減低受害人的損失。

警方會繼續善用這個跨境合作平台，並將邀請更多國家和地區加入，擴大合作網絡以提升打擊騙案的效能。警方同時會透過既有機制與內地及海外的執法機關和財富情報單位保持緊密溝通，以深化全球和區域執法合作，共同打擊網絡犯罪。

剛才有議員提到，希望警方能夠進一步加強攔截騙款和凍結詐騙案得益，以協助市民追回損失。事實上，警方一直積極與銀行業界合作，透過反詐騙協調中心設立的止付機制，為遇到懷疑詐騙的市民提供即時協助，並有效減低受害人的損失。自協調中心於二○一七年成立以來，截至二○二五年五月底，已接獲超過29萬宗公眾查詢，並成功在6581宗案件中攔截逾146億元騙款，成效顯著。

針對騙款轉移至境外的情況，協調中心亦積極與內地和多個海外執法機構合作，協力攔截跨境騙款。早於二○一九年，協調中心已聯同國際刑警組織設立「國際止付機制」，讓成員國之間互相提出止付要求，進一步提升打擊跨境詐騙的效率。至今，機制已成功在221宗案件中攔截約4.7億元騙款。另外，警方自二○二一年起推出「加密貨幣止付機制」，專門應對加密貨幣相關詐騙，至二○二五年五月已成功攔截總值約6.9億港元的加密貨幣騙款，為受害人減少損失。

警方亦持續深化與銀行業界的合作，又和金管局（香港金融管理局）及銀行界推出多項聯合反詐騙措施。例如，主動識別受害人的「騙案預警」計劃，至今已成功勸阻近五千名市民轉帳給騙徒。二○二三年六月，警方與主要銀行合作推出「財富情報交換平台」FINEST，為銀行業界提供一個安全高效的數據分析和交換平台，專門處理與金融罪案有關的企業客戶資料。同年年底，警方更成立反詐騙聯合情報中心，由銀行派駐人員進駐警察總部，與警方就追截騙款、識別潛在受害人和情報交流等方面進行更直接和即時的協作。

此外，《2025年銀行業（修訂）條例草案》已經於六月四日獲得通過，容許銀行在特定情況下分享企業和個人帳戶資料。警方現時正籌備全面升級FINEST平台，進一步促進信息互換，令銀行和相關執法機構能夠更快識別傀儡戶口和潛在受害人，及早採取行動，打擊犯罪集團以及協助受害人追回騙款。這些措施將有助更有效保障公眾免受詐騙和相關洗黑錢活動的侵害。

總括而言，政府會繼續以多管齊下的策略，全力推動防騙工作，積極檢視和優化現有法例，並加強與金融、通訊業界和各界的協作，提升市民防騙意識，從源頭減少受騙風險。同時，我們會密切留意網絡詐騙的最新趨勢和手法，適時調整政策和執法行動，確保香港的網絡安全體系與時並進。

​主席，政府堅持以保障市民財產安全為首要目標，維護香港作為國際金融和數碼城市的聲譽，致力為市民營造一個安全、可信賴的網絡環境。多謝主席。"

在演講中，陳茂波指出，過去兩年香港金融市場展現出強大韌性，資金持續流入，股票市場表現亮麗，銀行存款亦明顯增加。在全球政治經濟環境深刻變化之際，香港被視為全球資金的安全港，具備政策透明、穩定和可預期等特點，並高效連接中國與其他亞洲市場。

他強調，中國的科技創新發展迅速，越來越多內地前沿科企選擇在香港上市，國際投資者亦在透過香港資本市場分享中國科技發展的紅利，這也為韓國投資者帶來了機遇。與此同時，香港正積極拓展與內地金融市場的「互聯互通」，以及深化與其他金融市場的聯繫，尤其在交易所買賣產品（ETP）方面，已匯聚了來自世界各地的市場參與者。他指出，期待通過與韓國建立更多互惠安排，進一步推動雙方在相關領域的合作。此外，陳茂波也分享了香港在發展數字資產方面的策略和舉措，包括數字資產平台和穩定幣的發牌制度。

在午餐會上，陳茂波指出，香港在經歷疫情挑戰後經濟穩步增長，旅客數字持續上升，今年首六個月就接待了超過50萬名韓國旅客，按年增長25%。他指出，國際企業對香港的信心持續增強，二○二四年在港的外資及內地公司數量創歷史新高，其中韓國企業數目的增幅達9%。香港在國際金融中心和全球競爭力等的排名均位列前三；《香港國安法》實施後，香港非常安全和穩定的環境，進一步鞏固了國際投資者對香港營商環境的信心。

陳茂波也提到，香港作為粵港澳大灣區的國際門戶，連接着約8 700萬人的消費市場，整個大灣區亦正發展為兼具金融和創新科技優勢的區域。對韓國企業而言，香港「內聯外通」的優勢獨特，能夠在金融、創科、數字經濟、影視娛樂等多個領域為他們創造新的機遇，歡迎他們到香港發展。

下午，陳茂波與韓國金融服務委員會主席金秉煥會面，就雙方共同關注的金融發展和監管議題交流意見。他今日也分別與韓國風險投資協會及私募基金界代表交流，了解韓國相關行業生態和資產配置策略，並向他們介紹香港從股票市場到創新科技生態的投資機會。

在午餐會上，陳茂波指出，香港在經歷疫情挑戰後經濟穩步增長，旅客數字持續上升，今年首六個月就接待了超過50萬名韓國旅客，按年增長25%。他指出，國際企業對香港的信心持續增強，二○二四年在港的外資及內地公司數量創歷史新高，其中韓國企業數目的增幅達9%。香港在國際金融中心和全球競爭力等的排名均位列前三；《香港國安法》實施後，香港非常安全和穩定的環境，進一步鞏固了國際投資者對香港營商環境的信心。

陳茂波也提到，香港作為粵港澳大灣區的國際門戶，連接着約8 700萬人的消費市場，整個大灣區亦正發展為兼具金融和創新科技優勢的區域。對韓國企業而言，香港「內聯外通」的優勢獨特，能夠在金融、創科、數字經濟、影視娛樂等多個領域為他們創造新的機遇，歡迎他們到香港發展。

下午，陳茂波與韓國金融服務委員會主席金秉煥會面，就雙方共同關注的金融發展和監管議題交流意見。他今日也分別與韓國風險投資協會及私募基金界代表交流，了解韓國相關行業生態和資產配置策略，並向他們介紹香港從股票市場到創新科技生態的投資機會。

陳茂波明日（七月十日）將繼續在首爾的訪問行程，並於晚上返回香港。"

Customs officers intercepted two incoming female passengers, aged 36 and 45, at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point yesterday (July 8). A total of 15 369 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $63,000 and a duty potential of about $50,000, were seized from their personal baggage. They were subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. Both repeat and first-time offender may be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

立法會十八題：本港長者在內地養老,2025-07-09 18:10,2025-07-09 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900693.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上嚴剛議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

《2024年施政報告》提出加強長者服務及締造長者友善的樓宇環境。有意見指出本港長者選擇前往內地養老（尤其是在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）其他內地城市），不僅能夠提升長者的生活品質，也為香港騰出寶貴的生活空間，減輕政府的公共福利負擔。此外，近期內地（例如惠州市惠東縣、中山市沙溪鎮等區域）樓價大幅調整，有市民建議特區政府可研究以較低成本在內地興建或購買景觀較佳、租金實惠和室內環境更寬敞明亮的樓宇以作公共租住房屋（公屋），為本港長者在內地養老提供新的契機。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否考慮在大灣區內地城市收購空置待售物業作為公屋用途，供長者置換其現有的本港公屋，從而鼓勵長者在大灣區內地城市養老；若會，詳情為何；

（二）鑑於現時在「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」下，病人可獲安排以點對點模式從深圳的指定派送醫院直接運送到香港指定公立醫院，政府會否進一步深化有關合作機制，於今年擴大該試行計劃的覆蓋範圍至大灣區其他主要城市並涵蓋急症個案，讓在該等城市養老的患病長者，在有需要時可獲安排緊急載送回港，以增加他們北上養老的誘因；及

（三）會否加強與大灣區內地城市的協作，例如共同推動遙距診症及人工智能問診等以提升醫療服務效率，並促進樂齡科技及相關產業發展，從而更好地支援港人在該等內地城市養老？

答覆：

主席：

香港特別行政區（特區）政府按照優勢互補、互利共贏的原則，在堅持有利於香港和內地發展的大前提下，增加與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市的合作，為選擇在內地工作、居住或養老的香港市民提供額外選擇和便利。

就嚴剛議員的提問，經諮詢房屋局、勞工及福利局、衞生署和醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）房屋局一直配合各項推行的策略和政策以應對人口高齡化問題。為加強支援選擇在內地養老的長者，房屋局為領取可攜現金援助而須交回所租住的公共租住房屋（公屋）單位或刪除戶籍的長者提供彈性安排。顧及香港長者移居內地後可能遇上適應問題，香港房屋委員會及香港房屋協會容許長者保留其公屋單位或戶籍不超過六個月，寬限期由長者離開香港的日期開始計算。上述措施既可以減少長者移居內地的顧慮，亦有助釋出公屋單位以供流轉。

（二）《粵港澳大灣區發展規劃綱要》提出研究開展非急重病人跨境陸路轉運，探索在指定醫院開展跨境轉診合作試點。香港特區行政長官也在二○二三年《施政報告》中提出要探討大灣區醫院之間救護車跨境轉運病人的安排。在國家多個部委支持下，香港特區政府聯同廣東省和深圳市政府，以及澳門特區政府於二○二四年十一月三十日正式推出為期一年的「大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃」（「試行計劃」）。

「試行計劃」先實行跨境直通救護車由深圳和澳門的指定派送醫院（即香港大學深圳醫院（港大深圳醫院）和澳門仁伯爵綜合醫院）轉運病人到香港的指定公立醫院。經指定跨境合作醫院團隊評估及同意，有特定需要及臨床狀況合適（包括情況相對穩定）的病人可安排以「點對點」模式於指定醫院之間直接轉運到香港，無需在口岸轉換救護車，從而減低病人在運送過程的風險。至於有突發緊急醫療需要人士應到最就近的醫療設施接受治療。因此，「試行計劃」不會涵蓋急症個案。

視乎「試行計劃」的成效及運作經驗，粵港澳三地政府會考慮如何擴展「試行計劃」，例如增加指定醫院（包括深圳以外的大灣區內地城市）及／或將「試行計劃」擴展至雙向安排。

（三）正如上文所述，香港特區政府會按照優勢互補、互利共贏的原則，加強與大灣區內地城市的協作。事實上，香港與內地各自的資源及需要、相關法規和規管制度不同，香港特區政府會在確保跨境措施切實可行及對雙方有利的情況下，探討跨境便利措施。

具體而言，政府持續推行多項措施便利香港長者在大灣區內地城市養老，包括提供資助院舍照顧服務和可攜現金援助等。其中，「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃」為合資格接受資助院舍照顧服務的香港長者提供多一個選擇。勞工及福利局與廣東省民政廳二○二三年十一月簽訂《有關擴展「廣東院舍照顧服務計劃」合作意向書》，合作在大灣區內地城市物色由內地機構營辦的合適養老機構加入計劃。在有關當局協助下，參加計劃的在粵安老院增至15家，分布在六個大灣區內地城市。政府自今年五月委託非政府機構向參與計劃的長者和其家人提供關顧支援服務，並將在今年年底推出為期兩年的試行安排，分擔參與計劃的長者在國家基本醫療保障政策下須自付的部分醫療開支。

醫療服務方面，香港特區政府提供的公營或資助醫療服務，以照顧香港本地市民為基礎，而非香港市民在內地或海外的醫療需要。雖然如此，政府近年積極推動大灣區醫療合作，為不時往返大灣區內地城市工作或生活的香港市民提供額外選擇，讓他們可於內地指定服務點使用與在港相若的資助醫療服務，但有關措施亦並非為要全面照顧選擇在內地定居的香港市民所使用的醫療服務。例子包括：

（1）政府在二○二四年推行「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」，擴大長者醫療券（醫療券）適用範圍至七間位於大灣區內地城市的綜合醫療／牙科服務機構，為合資格香港長者提供更大的便利和靈活性，讓他們可在更多大灣區內的服務點善用醫療券，使用基層醫療服務，以提升健康。政府已於今年五月公布擴展該試點計劃，新增12間試點醫療機構至大灣區九個內地城市全覆蓋。12間新增試點醫療機構當中，四間（包括兩間位於珠海及各一間分別位於中山和廣州）已分別於六月二十六日及七月九日起開展服務，而另外兩個位於佛山的新增服務點亦將於七月十七日開展服務。其餘六間試點醫療機構預計於今年下半年可以陸續開展相關安排，屆時連同港大深圳醫院的一院兩點，合資格長者可以在大灣區內地城市合共21個服務點使用醫療券。

（2）政府今年三月宣布延展「支援粵港澳大灣區醫院管理局病人先導計劃」至二○二六年三月三十一日，以便利合資格的醫管局病人可選擇於大灣區指定協作醫療機構接受資助診症服務。此計劃為香港市民接受醫管局服務時提供更多選擇，計劃目前適用於港大深圳醫院。政府與醫管局會每年檢討該先導計劃的成效和涵蓋服務範圍，適時作出調整。

（3）為了便利長者安全地跨境使用電子健康紀錄，獲取更連貫的醫療服務，政府已在二○二四年七月起陸續於港大深圳醫院和「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」下七間醫療機構推行醫健通流動應用程式的「跨境健康紀錄」及「個人資料夾」功能。兩項功能今年會陸續擴展至該試點計劃下的新增醫療機構。此外，長者和其照顧者亦可利用醫健通流動應用程式查閱醫療券餘額和使用紀錄，以及隨時取覽儲存至醫健通的個人藥物紀錄、敏感及藥物不良反應等重要資料。

另外，國家人力資源和社會保障部和國家醫療保障局於二○一九年發布《香港澳門台灣居民在內地（大陸）參加社會保險暫行辦法》，容許符合資格的香港居民在內地可以參加國家醫療保險。"
LCQ18: Hong Kong elderly people spending retirement years in the Mainland,2025-07-09 18:10,2025-07-09 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900694.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Erik Yim and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 The 2024 Policy Address proposes to strengthen elderly services and foster an elderly-friendly building environment. There are views pointing out that the choice of Hong Kong elderly persons to spend their retirement years in the Mainland, particularly other Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), can not only improve elderly persons' quality of life, but also free up valuable living space in Hong Kong and ease the burden of public welfare on the Government. Moreover, amid the recent significant adjustments in property prices in the Mainland, such as areas like Huidong County in Huizhou and Shaxi Town in Zhongshan, some members of the public have proposed that the SAR Government may study the construction or purchase of buildings in the Mainland with better views, affordable rents, and more spacious and brighter interiors at lower costs for use as public rental housing (PRH), so as to provide Hong Kong elderly people with new opportunities to spend their retirement years in the Mainland. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will consider acquiring vacant properties pending sale in the Mainland cities of GBA for use as PRH flats with which the elderly people can replace their existing PRH flats in Hong Kong, thereby encouraging them to spend their retirement years in the Mainland cities of GBA; if so, of the details;

(2) given that at present, under the Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in the Greater Bay Area, arrangements can be made for patients to be transferred directly from designated sending hospitals in Shenzhen to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong in a point-to-point mode, whether the Government will further deepen the collaboration mechanism concerned by expanding the scope of the pilot scheme this year to cover other major cities in GBA and include emergency cases, so that emergency transport to Hong Kong can be arranged when necessary for elderly patients retiring in such cities, with a view to increasing the incentive for them to go north for retirement; and

(3) whether it will strengthen collaboration with the Mainland cities of GBA, such as jointly promoting remote diagnosis and AI medical consultation, to enhance healthcare service efficiency, as well as driving the development of gerontechnology and relevant industries, thereby better supporting Hong Kong people in spending their retirement years in such Mainland cities?

Reply:

President,

 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been following the principle of complementarity and mutual benefits to enhance co-operation with Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), on the premise of benefitting the development of Hong Kong and the Mainland, so as to provide more options and convenience for Hong Kong residents who choose to work, reside or retire on the Mainland.

 Having consulted the Housing Bureau, the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority (HA), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Erik Yim is as follows:

(1) The Housing Bureau has all along been supporting the implementation of various strategies and policies to cope with an ageing population. In order to strengthen the support to those who choose to retire on the Mainland, the Housing Bureau makes flexible arrangement for elderly public rental housing (PRH) residents who are required to surrender their PRH flats or delete their names from the tenancies upon receiving portable cash assistance. Considering Hong Kong elderly persons may encounter adaptation issues after moving to the Mainland, the Hong Kong Housing Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Society allow elderly persons to retain their PRH flats or their names in the tenancies for no more than six months, with the grace period starting from the date of the elderly persons' departure from Hong Kong. The above measure could address elderly persons' concern about moving to the Mainland and help release PRH flats for turnover.

(2) The study on the provision of land-based cross-boundary transfer for non-emergency and non-critically ill patients and the exploration of rolling out a pilot co-operation scheme for cross-boundary referral of patients between designated hospitals were put forward in the Outline Development Plan for the GBA. The Chief Executive of the HKSAR also put forward in his 2023 Policy Address the initiative to explore cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements between hospitals in the GBA. With the support of various national ministries, the HKSAR Government, in collaboration with the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Shenzhen Municipal Government and the Macao SAR Government, officially launched the one-year Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in the Greater Bay Area (Pilot Scheme) on November 30, 2024.

 The Pilot Scheme starts by arranging direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer of patients from designated sending hospitals in Shenzhen and Macao (i.e. the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZH) and the Conde S. Januario Hospital of Macao) to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong. Upon assessment and agreement by the teams of designated cross-boundary collaborating hospitals, arrangements can be made for patients with specific clinical needs and suitable clinical conditions (including that the conditions are relatively stable) to be transferred directly to Hong Kong between designated hospitals in a point-to-point mode without the handover of patients between ambulances at boundary control points, thus minimising risks posed to patients during transfer. Indeed, persons with urgent medical needs should receive treatment at the nearest medical facility. Therefore, the Pilot Scheme does not cover emergency cases.

 Subject to the effectiveness and operational experience of the Pilot Scheme, the governments of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao will consider how to extend the Pilot Scheme, such as including more designated hospitals (including those in GBA Mainland cities other than Shenzhen) and/or extending the Pilot Scheme to a two-way arrangement.

(3) As mentioned above, the HKSAR Government will follow the principle of complementarity and mutual benefits to strengthen the collaboration with Mainland cities of the GBA. Indeed, the resources, needs, relevant laws and regulations, and regulatory regimes differ between Hong Kong and the Mainland. The HKSAR Government will explore cross-boundary facilitation measures on the premise that these cross-boundary measures are feasible and mutually beneficial.

 Specifically, the Government has been implementing various measures to facilitate the retirement of Hong Kong elderly persons in Mainland cities of the GBA, including providing subsidised residential care services and portable cash assistance. Among them, the Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong provides an additional choice for eligible Hong Kong elderly persons to receive subsidised residential care services. The Labour and Welfare Bureau signed a ""Letter of Intent on Collaboration to Expand the Residential Care Services Scheme in Guangdong"" with the Department of Civil Affairs of Guangdong Province in November 2023 to co-operate in selecting suitable residential care homes for the elderly operated by Mainland organisations in Mainland cities of the GBA for joining the Scheme. With the assistance of the relevant authorities, the number of residential care homes for the elderly in Guangdong joining the Scheme has increased to 15, scattering in six Mainland cities within the GBA. The Government has, starting from this May, commissioned a non-governmental organisation to provide Social and Care Support Service for the elderly participants of the Scheme and their families, and will launch a two-year pilot arrangement by the end of this year to share part of the medical expenses that the elderly participants of the Scheme need to bear on their own under the National Basic Medical Insurance Policy.

 In terms of healthcare services, the public or subsidised healthcare services provided by the HKSAR Government are based on catering for the needs of local Hong Kong residents, rather than the healthcare needs of Hong Kong residents on the Mainland or overseas. Nevertheless, the Government has been actively promoting GBA healthcare collaboration in recent years to provide Hong Kong residents, who regularly travel to and from Mainland cities in the GBA for work or living, with additional choices of subsidised healthcare services comparable to those in Hong Kong at designated service points on the Mainland. Such measures, however, are not intended to fully cater for the healthcare services required by Hong Kong residents who choose to settle on the Mainland. Examples include:

(i) The Government launched the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme in 2024 to extend the coverage of the Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs) to seven integrated medical/dental institutions in Mainland cities of the GBA, offering more convenience and flexibility for eligible Hong Kong elderly persons by providing more service points in the GBA for them to better use their EHCVs on primary healthcare services to improve health conditions. The Government announced this May to extend the said Pilot Scheme and to increase 12 additional pilot medical institutions to cover all nine Mainland cities in the GBA. Among the 12 additional pilot medical institutions, four (viz. two located in Zhuhai and one each in Zhongshan and Guangzhou) launched the service on June 26 and July 9 respectively, while another two new service points in Foshan will launch the service on July 17. It is expected that the remaining six pilot medical institutions will launch the service gradually in the second half of this year. By then, together with the two existing service points operated by the HKU-SZH, eligible Hong Kong elderly persons can use the EHCVs at a total of 21 service points in Mainland cities of the GBA.

(ii) The Government announced this March the extension of the Pilot Scheme for Supporting Patients of the HA in the GBA till March 31, 2026, with a view to enabling eligible patients of the HA to choose to receive subsidised consultation services at the designated collaborating healthcare institution in the GBA. The Scheme aims to provide Hong Kong people with more choices when receiving HA's services, and is currently applicable to the HKU-SZH. The Government and the HA will evaluate the effectiveness and the scope of services of this Pilot Scheme each year and make necessary adjustments in a timely manner.

(iii) In order to enhance the continuity of medical care for elderly persons through facilitating their secure use of electronic health records across the boundary, the Government has progressively launched the new functions of ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" and ""Personal Folder"" of the eHealth mobile application (eHealth App) at the HKU-SZH and the seven medical institutions under the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme since July 2024. The two functions have will be progressively extended to the new medical institutions under the said Pilot Scheme this year. In addition, elderly persons and their carers can also use the eHealth App to check their EHCV balance and usage record, as well as access at any time important information stored in the eHealth App, such as their medications, allergies and adverse drug reactions.

 Separately, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Healthcare Security Administration promulgated the Interim Measures for Participation in Social Insurance by Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Residents on the Mainland in 2019, allowing eligible Hong Kong residents to participate in the national health insurance schemes on the Mainland."

Final preparations underway for commissioning of newly constructed temporary water mains at Ping Che Road on Sunday,2025-07-09 18:02,2025-07-09 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900626.htm,"To decommission water mains with bitumen lining at Ping Che Road, which supplies water to the area of Queen's Hill, the preparations for connecting the temporary water mains will enter a final stage this Saturday (July 12) for its commissioning on Sunday (July 13), the Water Supplies Department announced.

The WSD is thankful for the co-operation of various sectors of the community and road users, which has facilitated the full expedition and completion of the project on laying new temporary water mains as scheduled over a two-week time period.

The WSD will carry out a number of work processes on Saturday to connect the new water mains to the existing water supply system. Those processes include closing the existing valves, draining off the water in the water supply system, changing pipe fittings and welding the fittings to the new water mains, reopening the valves in phases and thoroughly flushing the water supply system. During the construction period, the water supply will have to be temporarily suspended so that the water supply route can be diverted to the newly laid temporary water mains.

To expedite the work processes so that the temporary water suspension duration can be shortened, the WSD will mobilise a workforce of about 200 to carry out the water main connection works during off-peak water usage hours, from 10pm on Saturday to 8am on Sunday, during which time the supply of fresh and flushing water to residents at the areas of Queen's Hill will be temporarily suspended. Affected areas will include Queens Hill Estate, Shan Lai Court, as well as 68 villages located at Sha Tau Kok Road (from Hung Leng Tsuen to Sha Tau Kok Town), Ping Che Road (from Hung Leng Tsuen to Wun Chuen Sin Kwoon), Ng Chow Road, Wo Keng Shan Road and Luk Keng. Since Queens Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court have water tanks acting as buffers, the actual duration of the water suspension may be shortened from 11pm on Saturday to 7am on Sunday.

Owing to the above situation, the WSD appealed to affected consumers to finish major daily cleaning and store water as needed before 10pm on Saturday. During the water suspension period, the WSD will provide sufficient temporary water supply which includes:

A total of 28 water tanks will be placed (before noon on Saturday) in Queens Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court with the assistance of the Housing Department;
Co-operationwith the North District Office (NDO) of the Home Affairs Department and placement of water tanks (before noon on Saturday) at 26 temporary water supply collection points in the affected rural areas; and
As some villages are remote with scattered populations, it may not be convenient for the residents to collect water at the designated water tanks. Therefore, the WSD, with the assistance of the NDO, will provide large bottled water to the affected villages through various distribution points.


Please see the Annex for the affected premises or villages, relevant locations of water tanks and distribution points of large bottled water.

To allow households to make early preparations, the WSD and the NDO have communicated with members of the North District Council, Rural Committees and Care Teams on the arrangements of the water suspension to put in place appropriate assistance measures for affected households. These measures include progressively distributing water suspension leaflets and affixing notices at conspicuous locations, and visiting households in need and social welfare organisations to remind them of making arrangements ahead of the suspension. Moreover, Care Teams will set up street counters again this weekend at Queens Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court to provide the latest information and assistance. As for the rural areas, Care Teams will set up street counters at the community halls in Sha Tau Kok Town and Ta Kwu Ling. Residents in need may also seek assistance from Care Teams by phone or instant messaging applications.

Before the resumption of the water supply by 8am Sunday, the WSD will flush the related water mains to ensure that the water quality is clear. When the water supply resumes, drinking water in the water mains may contain more air which will form numerous air bubbles, thus making the water look milky. Individual consumers may encounter milky or slightly turbid water in the early stage of the water resumption, which is normal. The WSD suggests that consumers first remove strainers of water taps, continuously run the taps for a few minutes and reinstall the strainers after the water becomes clear. Alternatively, consumers can let the water stand in a container for a while. The water will become clear again as the air bubbles dissipate.

For enquiries regarding water supply matters, consumers may call the WSD's 24-hour hotline: 2824 5000. Residents of Queens Hill Estate and Shan Lai Court may also call the respective 24-hour hotline of the estate/court at 2537 0001 or 2713 9530.

The WSD will also strive to replace the exposed temporary water mains which occupy part of the road with permanent underground water mains by end of this year. By that time, the section of temporary water mains will be relocated to other locations for reuse."
LCQ7: Labour importation in the lift and escalator industry,2025-07-09 17:35,2025-07-09 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900700.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):
  
Question:
  
The Government has been implementing the Labour Importation Scheme for the Construction Sector (Scheme) since 2023. Among the lift and escalator-related trades for applying importation under the Scheme, there are three trades of skilled workers (i.e. lift and escalator mechanic (master), lift mechanic and escalator mechanic) and one trade of technicians (i.e. lift/escalator technician). On the other hand, a union of lift and escalator employees has recently indicated that it hopes the Scheme can effectively ensure ""priority employment for local lift and escalator workers"". In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) from 2023 to March of this year, of the number of (i) lift and escalator mechanics (master), (ii) lift mechanics, (iii) escalator mechanics, and (iv) lift/escalator technicians imported annually under the Scheme (set out in the table below);




Year

(2) given that the Scheme requires imported lift and escalator mechanics (master), lift mechanics, escalator mechanics, and lift/escalator technicians to have a minimum of three years of relevant work experience, of the documentary proof required by the Government to verify the length of experience of such skilled workers/technicians; whether there are cases where such skilled workers/technicians fail to provide documentary proof of their length of experience; if so, of the criteria adopted by the Government to verify the length of experience of such skilled workers/technicians; and

(3) as it is learnt that the current qualification requirements for lift/escalator technicians in Hong Kong include holding a valid registration as a lift/escalator worker under the Lifts and Escalators Ordinance (Cap. 618), whether the Government has, regarding the verification of the qualifications of such technicians under the Scheme, established a system for mutual recognition of professional qualifications with other regions and countries; of the current procedure for the Government to verify the professional qualifications of each imported lift/escalator technician (including the documents required to be submitted by them)?

Reply:

President,

âTo address the manpower shortage in the construction industry, the HKSAR Government has been adopting a multi-pronged approach, including enhancing local training and recruitment, promoting the application of technology in the industry to enhance its overall productivity and under the principle of ensuring employment priority for local labour, implementing the Labour Importation Scheme for the Construction Sector (the Scheme) as a supplementary measure to fill the manpower gap.

The Scheme was launched in July 2023 with various requirements to safeguard employment priority for local labour, including:

(i) The approval would be given with due consideration of whether there is a genuine importation need for each application and whether local recruitment has been conducted as per the requirements of the Scheme and still could not recruit sufficient local personnel;
(ii) Local recruitment must be conducted through designated means, and the salary for the positions must not be lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of local labour engaged in similar positions as announced by the Development Bureau;
(iii) All imported labour must meet the same qualification requirements as those for the local labour engaged in similar work, including the required relevant working experience, number of working days and working hours, and the relevant working experience must be supported by documentary proof required by the relevant authorities; and
(iv) Manning ratio: The works project approved with quotas for imported labour must comply with a minimum ratio of 1:2, i.e., one imported labour to at least two full-time local labour.

In response to this question, after consulting the Immigration Department (ImmD) and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), the reply is as follows:

(1) The Scheme has a quota ceiling of 12 000. Quota allocation is on a rolling basis, i.e. quotas will be released for new applications after the completion of the relevant work activities. As of end March 2025, there were a total of 177 approved quotas for importation of lift/escalator mechanics (one of the trades of skilled workers) under the Scheme. Details are at Annex.

Also, no application for importing lift/escalator technicians (one of the positions of technicians) has been received under the Scheme so far.

(2) Employers intending to import labour under the Scheme must first apply for quotas from the Development Bureau.

Upon the approval of quota, the employer shall arrange for prospective labour to be imported to each submit a visa/entry permit application to the ImmD within the period specified in the Notice of Quota Application Result. When submitting the visa/entry permit application, the applicant is responsible for providing sufficient information for the ImmD's consideration. The required documents include proof of relevant working experience, such as reference letter from the employer on company letterhead paper, signed by an authorised person, and endorsed with a company stamp. The ImmD has been having rigorous assessments of applications for visas/entry permits. Same as the practice for processing visa/entry permit applications of imported labour, if necessary, the ImmD would consult relevant policy bureaux/departments on the proof of relevant working experience and would follow up as required by the policy bureaux/departments.

Generally the imported lift/escalator mechanics could provide the documentary proof of the relevant working experience as required under the Scheme. They must work under the instruction and supervision of locally qualified personnel specified under the Construction Workers Registration Ordinance (Cap. 583).

(3) The job positions of lift/escalator technicians eligible for importation of labour under the Scheme refer to general technicians (who are normally responsible for technical support on lift/escalator works including preparation, revision, proofreading and submission of drawings and other related technical documents), and do not include technical professionals responsible for the installation, maintenance and examination of lifts and escalators under the Lifts and Escalators Ordinance (Cap. 618). The lift/escalator technicians approved under the Scheme (if any) shall provide to the ImmD with proof of relevant working experience required for technicians (such as reference letter from the employer on company letterhead paper, signed by an authorised person, and endorsed with a company stamp), and shall also only work under the supervision of locally qualified personnel specified under the Lifts and Escalators Ordinance.

Both imported and local technical professionals responsible for the installation, maintenance and examination of lifts and escalators under the Lifts and Escalators Ordinance shall be registered according to the Lifts and Escalators Ordinance before they can perform the duty of relevant technical professionals. Currently, these non-local technical professionals could only apply to work in Hong Kong via the newly established Technical Professional List under the General Employment Policy and the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals. Same as local technical professionals, imported technical professionals need to meet the specified requirements for successful registration after arriving in Hong Kong, including (i) at least eight years of experience as a lift/escalator worker covering installation, maintenance and examination works as specified by the EMSD, or possessing qualification of a certificate course recognised by the EMSD and at least four years of experience as a lift/escalator worker covering installation, maintenance and examination works as specified by the EMSD; (ii) holding a certificate of qualification recognised by his/her place of origin for working as a lift/escalator worker; and(iii) having passed the relevant test recognised by the EMSD. Owing to the higher technical level required for these technical professional works, relevant working experience obtained before entry to Hong Kong must be supported, on top of the aforementioned documentary proof (such as reference letter from the employer), by third-party (e.g. notary public) certificates of verification.

According to the relevant legislation, the registration requirements of the technical professionals mentioned above mainly include relevant working experience and passing the aforementioned test held in Hong Kong, so the verification of fulfilling the requirement is mainly through documentary evidence and test without the need for additional recognition of professional qualifications."
立法會七題：升降機及自動梯行業的輸入勞工,2025-07-09 17:35,2025-07-09 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900699.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上梁子穎議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

政府自二○二三年開始推行「建造業輸入勞工計劃」（該計劃）。該計劃合資格申請輸入的升降機及自動梯行業相關工種中，有三個技術工人工種（即升降機及自動梯技工（全科）、升降機技工及自動梯技工）及一個技術人員工種（即升降機／自動梯技術員）。另一方面，近日升降機及自動梯工會表示，希望該計劃能夠確切做到「保障本地升降機及自動梯工人就業優先」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）自二○二三年至本年三月，每年透過該計劃輸入的（ｉ）升降機及自動梯技工（全科）、（ｉｉ）升降機技工、（ｉｉｉ）自動梯技工及（ｉｖ）升降機／自動梯技術員的數目為何（以下表列出）；

（二）鑑於該計劃要求輸入的升降機及自動梯技工（全科）、升降機技工、自動梯技工及升降機／自動梯技術員須具備最少三年的相關工作經驗年資，政府就核實該等技術工人／技術人員的經驗年資所要求提供的證明文件為何；有否出現該等技術工人／技術人員無法提供經驗年資證明文件的情況；如有，政府會以甚麼準則核實該等技術工人／技術人員的經驗年資；及

（三）據悉現時本港升降機／自動梯技術員的資歷要求包括持有《升降機及自動梯條例》（第618章）下升降機／自動梯工程人員的有效註冊資格，就核實該計劃下該等技術員的資歷，政府有否與其他地區及國家建立專業資格互認制度；政府現時核實每名輸入的升降機／自動梯技術員的專業資歷的程序（包括要求他們提交的文件）為何？

答覆：

主席：

​為應對建造業人力短缺，特區政府採取多管齊下的措施，包括加強培訓本地人手及招聘新人入行，推動業界應用科技，以提升建造業整體生產力，以及在保障本地勞工優先就業的原則下，推行「建造業輸入勞工計劃」（計劃），作為輔助措施以協助填補人手短缺。

計劃於二○二三年七月推出，有各項相關要求保障本地勞工優先就業，包括：

（ｉ）審批會考慮每宗申請是否有確切需要、是否已按要求進行本地招聘而未能聘用足夠本地人手，始獲批出配額；
（ｉｉ）本地招聘須透過指定途徑進行，招聘職位的薪酬待遇，不得低於發展局公布從事相關職位本地勞工當時的每月工資中位數；
（ｉｉｉ）所有輸入勞工必須符合與從事同類工作的本地勞工同樣的資歷要求，包括所需相關工作經驗、工作日數及時數等，而有關工作經驗必須備有符合相關部門要求的文件證明； 及
（ｉｖ）人手比例：獲批輸入勞工配額的工程合約必須符合不少於1：2的人手比例的規定，即一名輸入勞工對最少兩名全職本地勞工。

​就本提問，經諮詢入境事務處（入境處）及機電工程署（機電署）後，現綜合答覆如下：

（一）計劃批出的配額設有上限12 000個。配額分配屬滾動式，即部分工程工序完結後會釋放配額再供申請。截至二○二五年三月底，透過計劃曾經獲批的輸入升降機／自動梯技工（屬技術工人工種）配額共177個。詳情見附件。

另外，計劃至今並未接獲輸入升降機／自動梯技術員（屬技術人員職位）配額的申請。

（二）僱主如有意在計劃下輸入勞工，須先向發展局申請配額。

如配額申請獲批，僱主須在「配額申請結果通知書」上所指明的限期內，安排其每名擬聘用的輸入勞工向入境處遞交簽證／進入許可申請。遞交簽證／進入許可申請時，申請人須提供足夠資料供入境處考慮。須提供的文件包括其相關工作經驗證明，例如以公司信紙撰寫、蓋有公司印章並由獲授權人士簽署的僱主推薦信。入境處一直嚴格審批每宗簽證／進入許可的申請。與一貫處理輸入勞工的簽證／進入許可申請一樣，入境處就相關工作經驗證明會按需要諮詢相關政策局／政府部門，並按政策局／政府部門要求作所需跟進。

計劃下至今獲批來港工作的升降機／自動梯技工，一般都能按要求提供相關工作經驗證明，他們亦須在《建造業工人註冊條例》（第583章）下指明的本地合資格人員的指示及督導下，進行工作。

（三）計劃下合資格申請的升降機／自動梯技術員職位，涉及的乃一般技術員（即一般負責升降機／自動梯的技術支援包括擬備、修訂、校對及提交圖則及其他相關技術文件），並不包括負責根據《升降機及自動梯條例》（第618章）安裝、保養及檢驗升降機及自動梯的技術專才。計劃下獲批的升降機／自動梯一般技術員（如有）須向入境處提供證明其符合技術員所需的相關工作經驗證明（如以公司信紙撰寫、蓋有公司印章並由獲授權人士簽署的僱主推薦信），亦須要在《升降機及自動梯條例》下指明的本地合資格人員監督下，進行工作。

至於負責按《升降機及自動梯條例》安裝、保養及檢驗升降機及自動梯的技術專才，不論本地及輸入的專才，均須按《升降機及自動梯條例》註冊，才可擔任有關技術專才的工作。現時來自本地以外的這類技術專才只可透過「一般就業政策」及「輸入內地人才計劃」下新設的「技術專才清單」申請來港工作。輸入的專才與本地技術專才一樣，需要符合指定要求才可在來港後成功註冊，包括（ｉ）具備最少八年機電署指定作為升降機／自動梯工程人員的安裝、保養及檢驗的工作經驗，或獲機電署認可證書課程的資歷及具備最少四年機電署指定作為升降機及自動梯工程人員的安裝、保養及檢驗的工作經驗；（ｉｉ）需要持有其原居地認可從事升降機／自動梯工程人員工作的證明；以及（ｉｉｉ）通過獲機電署認可的相關測試。由於這些技術專才的工作需要較高技術水平，其須向入境處提交到港前的相關工作經驗證明，除上述的證明文件（如僱主推薦信），亦須有由第三方（如公證行）核實的證明書。

按香港相關法例，上述的技術專才的註冊要求主要包括相關工作經驗及通過上述在香港進行的測試，因而主要透過文件證明核實及測試確立符合要求，無需另行認可專業資格。"
​立法會：保安局局長就「研究訂立網絡安全法，建構完善的反網絡詐騙體系」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-09 17:30,2025-07-09 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900591.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（七月九日）在立法會會議就「研究訂立網絡安全法，建構完善的反網絡詐騙體系」議員議案的開場發言：

主席：

我感謝邱達根議員的議案，以及陳克勤議員和李浩然議員提出的修正案，就「研究訂立網絡安全法，建構完善的反網絡詐騙體系」這個重要議題發表意見和提出建議。

網絡安全和相關法規

我知道大家都很關注網絡詐騙的問題，而政府亦十分關注這個問題。首先，「網絡安全」範圍很廣泛，包括保障網絡基礎設施、打擊網絡犯罪、保護個人資料、確保資訊流通安全等。香港作為國際金融中心，數碼經濟發展迅速，上述各方面都是我們社會長遠發展不可或缺的一部分。

不同司法管轄區在網絡安全法律方面有不同做法，例如內地的《中華人民共和國網絡安全法》除了針對網絡詐騙和網絡罪行，還包括個人資料保障、網絡實名制、關鍵基礎設施保護、網絡內容管理等多個重要範疇。

至於香港，在保障網絡安全上，我們採用不同法例，具針對性地處理與網絡安全相關的不同議題。針對個人資料私隱，我們有行之有效的《個人資料（私隱）條例》，包括一些針對「起底」或直接促銷等行為，作出刑事規管。

針對用電腦進行的犯罪行為，我們會利用《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）第161條的「不誠實取用電腦」罪行處理。

針對詐騙，現時亦有多項法例處理不同類型、不同場景的詐騙行為。例如《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）第16A條「欺詐罪」，或同一條例第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，以及《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）第71條的「製造虛假文書罪」。另外，任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，即俗稱「洗黑錢」罪。這些法例為執法部門提供有力的工具打擊詐騙活動。

正如陳克勤議員提到，基於互聯網、社交媒體、即時通訊軟件和電子支付工具興起的全球大趨勢，不少司法管轄區近年均見詐騙案顯著上升，香港亦不例外。根據最新數據，在香港，二○二五年一至五月份詐騙案錄得17 077宗，比去年同期上升8.4%，其中網上詐騙佔總案件近七成，比去年同期上升18%。雖然整體案件數字有所增加，但涉及金額卻較去年同期下跌24.3%，這反映了我們在防止和打擊騙案工作方面的努力取得一定成效，但同時也顯示騙徒手法不斷變更，防範工作必須與時並進，需要多方面合作。

多方合作機制

政府同意邱達根議員所說，要有效打擊詐騙，必須積極推動政府、商界、市民三方面協作，從多角度建立完善反詐騙體系。

政府層面

在政府層面，近年我們在推動法律改革、持續檢視並完善現有的法律法規保障方面，以至在加強本地和透過跨境協作執法，都做了大量工作。

推動法律改革

法律改革委員會（法改會）在二○一九年成立小組委員會，就電腦網絡罪行展開研究，並在二○二二年十月完成首階段關於依賴電腦網絡的罪行和司法管轄權公眾諮詢工作，建議制定一項全新針對電腦網絡罪行的特定法例，涵蓋五類依賴電腦網絡的罪行，包括非法取覽、截取、干擾電腦數據和系統，以及提供用作犯罪的器材或數據等。

目前，法改會正進行第二階段研究，聚焦於利用電腦網絡擴大犯罪規模的傳統罪行，例如設立仿冒詐騙網站等犯罪行為。政府會密切留意法改會的研究進展和最終建議，並適時檢討法例。

為打擊網上和電訊詐騙，政府正檢視電話卡實名登記制的整體運作，包括降低可擁有電話儲值卡數目上限和禁止轉售已實名登記的電話智能卡等安排，並正着手制定相關法例修訂的細節。商務及經濟發展局會於下星期向立法會資訊科技及廣播事務委員會介紹有關修例建議。

執法

在執法方面，警方針對騙徒常用的傀儡戶口作出重點打擊，摧毀詐騙產業鏈。二○二四年，警方就涉及各類型騙案和洗黑錢的罪行共拘捕10 496人；二○二五年首五個月共拘捕3 028人，當中約七成被捕人士是傀儡戶口持有人。警方亦自二○二三年底起，就涉及傀儡戶口的案件，向法庭申請引用《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》第27條加重刑罰，有被定罪的傀儡戶口持有人刑期加幅超過三成，進一步加強阻嚇力。

跨境協作

跨境協作方面，網絡詐騙無遠弗屆，正如李浩然議員提及，加強跨境執法能力、跨區域司法協作，是打擊跨境詐騙和網絡罪行的重要一環。因此，警方一直積極參與國際協作。例如國際刑警組織全球網絡罪案專家組、國際刑警組織亞洲及南太平洋科技罪案聯合行動工作組會議等，加強各國技術和情報交流。

在攔截騙款方面，協調中心（反詐騙協調中心）已聯同國際刑警組織設立「國際止付機制」，讓成員國之間互相提出止付要求，進一步提升打擊跨境詐騙的效率。

而在二○二四年，香港警務處與10個國家和司法地區成立反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」，包括澳洲、加拿大、香港特別行政區、印尼、澳門特別行政區、馬來西亞、馬爾代夫、新加坡、南韓和泰國，透過強化情報交流與協調行動，共同打擊詐騙、與網絡相關和洗黑錢的案件。

今年四至五月，「FRONTIER+」平台更首次進行聯合行動，成功識別並瓦解多個跨境詐騙網絡，共拘捕1 858人，涉及9 268宗案件，包括投資騙案在內的詐騙案。

警方會繼續善用這個跨境合作平台，並會邀請更多國家和地區加入，擴大合作網絡，提升打擊騙案的效能。警方同時會透過既有機制，例如國際刑警組織、內地和海外的執法機關和財富情報單位保持緊密溝通，以深化全球和區域執法合作，堵截騙款，共同打擊網絡犯罪。

商界方面

至於商界方面，針對打擊網絡詐騙情況，我們跟商業夥伴緊密合作，特別是通訊和金融業界。

與通訊業協作

警方一直與通訊事務管理局辦公室（通訊辦）和電訊商緊密合作，並在二○二二年九月起成立專責工作小組，制定和實施一系列源頭堵截措施。電訊商現時已積極根據警方提供的詐騙紀錄和資料，將涉嫌進行詐騙的電話號碼封鎖或停止該些號碼的服務，並阻截用戶登入懷疑詐騙網站。截至今年五月底，已有超過五萬個網頁連結和約九千個本地和非本地電話號碼被攔截。

此外，通訊辦亦有要求電訊商按通訊事務管理局制定的業務守則監察其網絡和系統打出的電話或發出的短訊，一旦懷疑某電話號碼打出電話或發出短訊的模式涉及詐騙活動，就會暫停該電話號碼的服務。截至今年五月底，約有143萬個本地電話號碼因此被暫停服務。

除了這些措施，通訊辦亦要求電訊商攔截以「+852」為開首的可疑來電、就其他以「+852」開首的境外來電向所有流動電話用戶發送話音提示或文字信息、就新啓動流動電話儲值卡播放提示，和推行「短訊發送人登記制」以協助市民識別短訊發送人的身分。

針對騙徒一般以新登記的電話儲值卡進行電話詐騙，自二○二四年十二月起，市民在接聽由本地新啓動流動電話儲值卡打出的電話時，電訊商會先以粵語和普通話播放「來電由新儲值卡打出」的話音提示，提醒大家要提高警覺。

針對打擊短訊詐騙，通訊辦也推出「短訊發送人登記制」。在登記制下，只有已登記成為「已獲認證的發送人」的公司或機構，才可使用其以「＃」號開頭的「已登記的短訊發送人名稱」發出短訊予本地流動服務用戶，以進一步協助市民識別短訊發送人的身分和提高市民防騙意識。

與金融業界協作

在金融業界協作方面，警方同步與金管局（香港金融管理局）和銀行業界推出多項聯合打擊詐騙措施，包括在二○二三年五月起推行「騙案預警」計劃，主動識別騙案受害人，至今全港已有28間零售銀行均已參與該計劃，並成功勸阻4 559人繼續轉款給騙徒，阻截損失逾3.5億元。反詐騙協調中心的止付機制也與銀行合作攔截受害人匯出的款項，至今透過攔截騙款達146億元。

自二○二三年推出的「可疑帳號警示」機制，連接「防騙視伏器」至銀行不同日常轉帳服務，當市民轉帳時，如資料庫配對出收款人資料與詐騙舉報有關，就會即時警示。機制的涵蓋範圍自推出以來不斷擴展，現時已覆蓋絕大部分市民的日常轉帳。

此外，警方在二○二三年與主要銀行成立反詐騙聯合情報中心，由銀行派駐人員就詐騙案件向警方提供即時協助，以提升追截騙款的效能和加快識別潛在騙案受害人。情報中心成立以來，銀行在攔截騙款方面的平均回應時間大幅減至1小時，並透過加強後續監察和主動介入，有效保護無法聯絡或拒絕相信自己受騙的市民。

市民方面

市民方面，警方亦一直聯同不同的民間組織宣揚反詐騙的信息，例如透過關愛隊（地區服務及關愛隊伍）網絡，將防騙資訊直接帶入民居。警方亦跟大學、社福機構、外傭中介等合作，設計針對新來港學生、老人和外傭等高風險群體的反詐信息，確保資訊覆蓋廣泛和全面。

警方亦得到不同界別的公私營機構協助，舉辦大型社區活動，例如去年十二月在西九文化區的「全城反詐嘉年華」、聯合海洋公園打造的「當提子遇上熊貓」主題防騙活動，亦將纜車化作「流動反詐課堂」，以互動形式向市民講解最新犯案手法。

宣傳教育

預防詐騙最根本的依然是提升市民的防騙意識，這是最重要的。警方會繼續採取多渠道、「鋪天蓋地」的宣傳策略，提高市民對各類型騙案的警覺性。

警方會因應最新的罪案趨勢，不時更新防騙信息和籌劃線上線下防騙宣傳工作，包括透過「防騙刑警」拆解各類型詐騙手法、分享中小學教材、建立小紅書、抖音帳號、舉行記者招待會講解最新行騙手法和舉辦大型宣傳活動等，提高市民大眾的防騙意識。

警方亦推出不同類型的主題防騙宣傳，包括運用多種流動宣傳平台如「防騙宣傳車」和「防騙雪糕車」等，讓防騙信息流動地出現在全港各區。針對詐騙案件猖厥，警方自二○二○年推出的防騙吉祥物「提子」已經深入民心，成為打擊騙案的代名詞，透過在電視和電台的廣告時段播放宣傳短片和電台廣播、社交媒體平台上緊貼潮流的帖文，甚至通訊程式貼圖等，用親民和「入屋」的方法跟網民和大眾互動。另外，為使「提子」吉祥物的存在更真實，在解釋騙徒的最新犯案手法時，往往設身處地，讓公眾產生共鳴，更易消化簡單易明的防騙信息。

在媒體宣傳層面，我們採取「雙軌並行」策略：一方面透過電台、電視等傳統平台保持廣泛覆蓋；另一方面積極利用社交媒體，製作各類短片、語音和圖文內容，針對不同年齡層和群組如青少年、長者和內地新來港人士，包括學生等的媒體使用習慣進行精準投放，令防騙信息更具針對性以加強成效。

警方將持續推廣「18222防騙易」熱線、「防騙視伏器」及「防騙視伏App」等實用工具，讓市民隨時獲取防騙支援，減少受騙的機會。

結語

展望未來，政府會繼續密切留意詐騙案的最新趨勢，以及法改會的電腦網絡罪行檢討結果，並透過政府、商界、市民協作，持續完善跨部門和跨境合作平台，並積極加強與金融、通訊業界的協作。同時，我們會持續加強宣傳教育，提高市民防騙意識，從源頭減少受騙風險。政府歡迎議員和社會各界提出寶貴意見，一同宣揚反詐信息，攜手完善本港反詐騙體系，守護市民財產安全，維護香港作為國際金融和數碼城市的聲譽，為全港市民營造一個安全、可信賴的網絡環境。

主席，我會仔細聆聽各位議員的發言，總結時再回應各位議員的意見。多謝。"
為坪輋路新建臨時喉管周日啓用作最後準備,2025-07-09 17:21,2025-07-09 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900624.htm,"​水務署宣布，為永久停用供水予皇后山一帶的坪輋路瀝青塗層喉管，在上址敷設的臨時喉管已經竣工並將於本周六（七月十二日）作最後接駁準備，以便於周日（七月十三日）啓用。

水務署感謝社區各界及道路使用者的配合，讓署方和承建商得以全速進行加建臨時喉管工程，並如期在約兩星期時間完成。

水務署將於本周六為接駁新喉管至現有供水系統進行多個工序，包括關閉現有喉管閘掣、系統排水、於多個接駁點更換管件並焊接新喉管、分階段重啓閘掣，以及徹底沖洗相關供水系統，施工期間需要暫停供水，以把供水路線改道至新敷設的臨時喉管。

為盡快完成上述工序並縮短所需停水時間，水務署將動員約200人於周六晚上十時至周日早上八時非繁忙用水時間進行該等喉管接駁工程，期間皇后山一帶住戶的食水及沖廁水需要暫停。受影響地區包括皇后山邨、山麗苑及位於沙頭角公路（由孔嶺村至沙頭角墟）、坪輋路（由孔嶺村至雲泉仙館）、五洲路、禾徑山路及鹿頸一帶的68條鄉村。由於皇后山邨及山麗苑有大廈水缸作為緩衝，估計實際停水時間可縮短至周六晚上十一時至周日早上七時。

因應以上情況，水務署呼籲受影響用戶於本周六晚上十時之前完成日常主要清洗及按需要作儲水準備。暫停供水期間，水務署會提供足夠臨時食水供應，當中包括：

在房屋署的協助下於皇后山邨及山麗苑合共放置28個水箱（預計於周六中午前完成設置）；
與民政事務總署北區民政事務處（北區民政處）合作，於受影響的鄉郊地區設置26個臨時食水取水點並放置水箱（預計於周六中午前完成設置）；及
由於部分鄉村較為偏遠，人口分散，到指定水箱取水可能不太方便，因此在北區民政處的協助下，水務署將會透過多個分發點向受影響鄉村提供大型樽裝水，供居民取用。


受暫停供水影響的屋苑／鄉村及有關水箱的位置及大型樽裝水分發點的名單見附件。

為讓受影響用戶及早作好準備，水務署及北區民政處已就暫停供水安排與多名北區區議員、鄉事委員會及關愛隊等地區人士溝通，以部署向受影響住戶提供適切協助，包括陸續派發暫停供水及注意事項的單張、在當眼位置張貼告示，以及探訪區內有需要住戶及社福機構以提醒其預早作出安排等。此外，關愛隊會於本周末再次在皇后山邨及山麗苑設置街站，為居民提供最新資訊及協助；在鄉郊地區，關愛隊亦會在沙頭角墟及打鼓嶺社區會堂設置街站，有需要的居民亦可透過電話及即時通訊軟件聯絡關愛隊，以尋求協助。

於本周日早上八時恢復供水前，水務署會沖洗有關供水喉管，確保水質清澈。由於水管內的食水在恢復供水時有機會含有較多空氣而形成大量氣泡，個別用戶的用水在恢復供水初期可能呈奶白色或出現稍為混濁的情況，此乃正常現象。水務署建議用戶先移除水龍頭隔篩，並持續開啓水龍頭數分鐘，待水質回復清澈再裝回隔篩。另外，用戶可以讓食水在容器中靜止一會，待氣泡消散後，食水便會回復清澈。

如用戶對供水有任何查詢，請致電水務署24小時熱線2824 5000。皇后山邨及山麗苑用戶亦可分別致電屋邨／屋苑辦事處24小時熱線2537 0001或2713 9530。

另外，水務署爭取於今年年底前以藏於地底的永久喉管替代該段外露並佔用部分路面的臨時喉管，屆時該段臨時喉管將移往其他地方重用。"

署理文化體育及旅遊局局長出席青島文化旅遊（香港）推介交流會致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-07-09 16:55,2025-07-09 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900690.htm,"以下是署理文化體育及旅遊局局長劉震今日（七月九日）出席青島文化旅遊（香港）推介交流會的致辭全文：

尊敬的曾贊榮書記（青島市委書記）、周強副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部副部長兼貿易處負責人）、各位領導、各位嘉賓們：

大家下午好！我今日非常榮幸可以出席的青島文化旅遊推介交流會，跟來自青島市和香港本地的文旅業界共聚一堂，共商合作、共謀發展。青島跟香港都是沿海的城市，兩地的人民都是熱情好客。我很幸運有兩次的機會去了青島市，第一次是二○一四年，當時去參加亞太經合組織部長級會議，第一次親身的感受到青島市市民的熱情，還有當地的文化底蘊。第二次是二○一六年，當時國家行政學院安排我們去那邊參觀學習，參觀了著名的青島啤酒廠。其實香港跟青島的關係非常密切，大概三十二年前，就是一九九三年的七月，青島啤酒就是第一個來香港上市的H股，就見我們兩地的關係是多麼的深厚。

青島市風光明媚，山明水秀，有「海上第一名山」之稱的嶗山風景區、也有剛才提到的標誌着青島啤酒製作歷史的青島啤酒博物館、以及有「萬國建築博覽會」之稱的「八大關」景點，都是很有特色的文旅資源。此外，青島市的五四廣場，更體現了五四青年的愛國情懷，絕對是海內外旅客，特別是我們香港的青年，認識祖國歷史的必到之處。

香港是一個中西文化薈萃的國際旅遊城市，一直是海外旅客進入內地的門戶，是連接內地和全球的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」。在中央高度重視和關顧香港旅遊業的發展下，經優化的「個人遊」計劃在去年三月六日已擴展至青島。青島與香港的之間的關係日益深厚，兩地遊客的雙向奔赴亦日見頻繁。

在二○二五年首五個月，香港共接待了超過2 000萬名旅客，按年上升約一成，而在二○二五年首五個月，大概有390萬訪港海外旅客中，有大概68萬人次經香港前往內地。香港跟青島之間有完善的交通網絡，每日有多班直航班次往返兩地，穿梭兩地只需要短短的三個多小時，實在是有非常好的條件繼續深化我們兩地的合作，推動客源互送。香港會繼續發揮好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，用好中央政府的惠港措施，鞏固內地客源市場，亦會進一步探討如何便利國際旅客通過香港入境內地的安排，鞏固香港作為國家的國際門戶角色。

在以上的背景下，我們將加強青島與香港的旅遊合作，促進資源共享，互補優勢。特區政府在去年年底發表《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》，提出四大發展策略、133項措施，涵蓋產品開發、拓展客源、推動智慧旅遊和提升服務四個方面的工作。我們正不斷強化世界級旅遊景點、美食、城市管理和運輸系統等傳統旅遊優勢，同時發掘新的旅遊資源，包括透過盛事和節慶活動從軟實力上為城市注入動力和新鮮感，提升旅遊城市氛圍，我們歡迎更多青島旅客到香港來，感受香港的多元文化和活力。

我衷心感謝青島市政府對香港的重視，在香港舉辦這次的推介會，讓青港兩地可以深化合作，共同推動旅遊業務蓬勃發展。我期望青港兩地建立更緊密的聯繫，就客源互送和共同引進海外旅客進行更多合作交流。

我在這裏祝願這次的推介會圓滿成功，青島市和香港能夠在文旅領域攜手共進，共同開創更加美好的未來，也希望我們香港的市民可以多去青島走一走，看一看，親身感受一下我們青島的魅力，謝謝大家！"
「出售綠表置居計劃單位2024」七月十七日開始接受申請（附圖）,2025-07-09 16:55,2025-07-09 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900473.htm,"下稿代香港房屋委員會發出：

香港房屋委員會（房委會）今日（七月九日）宣布，「出售綠表置居計劃（綠置居）單位2024」（「綠置居2024」）將於七月十七日上午八時至八月六日晚上七時接受合資格綠表人士申請，為期三個星期。

宏緻苑提供實用面積介乎約17.9平方米至約43.3平方米（約193平方呎至約466平方呎）的單位，其中較受申請者歡迎的大單位（實用面積約41.8平方米至約43.3平方米（約450平方呎至約466平方呎）），佔單位總數逾四分之一（見附表一）。

房委會發言人說：「房委會一直以來致力完善房屋階梯，透過推出各項資助出售單位計劃及持續優化相關安排，協助經濟能力較佳的公共租住房屋（公屋）租戶購買資助出售單位，達至向上流動之效。我們鼓勵有能力的公屋住戶把握機會申請『綠置居2024』，早日達成他們的置業願望。為增加申請者成功購買單位的機會，『綠置居2024』將會實施優化安排，向前兩次曾連續申請『綠置居2022』及『綠置居2023』而未能成功購買單位的申請者，分派多一個抽籤號碼。」

「綠置居2024」的單位折扣率定在評定市值折減40%，即以六折出售。宏緻苑單位的售價介乎115萬元至349萬元，平均售價大約為247萬元。

發言人説：「按照約247萬元的單位平均售價計算（實用面積約34平方米或約366平方呎），假設按揭貸款與單位售價比例為95%、按揭還款期30年，並以現行按揭利率約3.5%計算，每月按揭還款額大約10,500元。至於一至二人單位，單位的售價約128萬元，每月按揭還款額約5,500元。」

選樓的優先次序及配額

受房委會已公布公屋清拆計劃影響的租戶（即彩虹邨碧海樓、金碧樓和丹鳳樓，以及華富邨華安樓和華樂樓），若選擇購買資助出售單位以代替入住公屋，可在「綠置居2024」較其他申請者優先選樓（見附表二）。

「綠置居2024」將設定1 050個綠置居單位的配額予參加「家有長者優先選樓計劃」和「家有初生優先選樓計劃」的家庭申請者。凡有嬰兒於二○二三年十月二十五日或以後出生的家庭申請者，而有關子女在「綠置居2024」申請截止日期時為3歲或以下，均符合「家有初生優先選樓計劃」的申請資格。此外，一人申請者將會獲預留250個綠置居單位的配額。

申請安排

合資格申請者可經網上遞交申請、親身遞交或郵寄紙本申請，申請費用為290元。「出售居者有其屋計劃單位2024」的有效綠表申請者，如已表明同意把其申請保留至「綠置居2024」，則不需要重新遞交申請和繳付申請費用。「綠置居2024」預計於今年第三季／第四季進行攪珠，並在同年第四季開始選樓。

由明日（七月十日）開始，公眾可於房委會／房屋署為「綠置居2024」設立的指定網站www.housingauthority.gov.hk/gsh/2024瀏覽或下載申請表、申請須知及售樓資料簡介／單張。公眾亦可於明日起於辦公時間內到觀塘房委會綠置居銷售小組辦事處（綠置居售樓處）、樂富房委會客戶服務中心、房委會轄下各屋邨辦事處和分區租約事務管理處、房協轄下各出租屋邨辦事處及各區民政諮詢中心索取印刷本。

Applications for Sale of Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme Flats 2024 to commence from July 17 (with photos),2025-07-09 16:55,2025-07-09 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900476.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Housing Authority:

 The Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) announced today (July 9) that the Sale of Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) Flats 2024 (GSH 2024) will open for applications from eligible Green Form (GF) applicants for three weeks, starting from 8am on July 17 until 7pm on August 6.

 The HA will offer under GSH 2024 a total of 2 576 new GSH flats from Wang Chi Court in Kowloon Bay, resale GSH flats which were first put up for sale under GSH 2020/21 and GSH 2022, and a new batch of recovered Tenants Purchase Scheme (TPS) flats.

 Wang Chi Court provides flats with saleable areas ranging from about 17.9 square metres to about 43.3 sq m (about 193 square feet to about 466 sq ft). Large flats, with saleable areas ranging from about 41.8 sq m to about 43.3 sq m (about 450 sq ft to about 466 sq ft), which are more popular among applicants, will account for more than a quarter of the total number of flats (See Annex 1).

 ""The HA has long been striving to enhance the housing ladder through the provision of various types of subsidised sale flats (SSFs) and continuous enhancement of relevant arrangements in order to assist Public Rental Housing (PRH) tenants with better financial capabilities to achieve upward mobility by purchasing SSFs.We encourage capable PRH tenants to seize the opportunity to apply for GSH 2024 and fulfil their home ownership aspirations early. With an aim to increase applicants' chances of success, GSH 2024 will implement the enhancement measure of allocating an extra ballot number to applicants who had failed to purchase a flat in GSH 2022 and GSH 2023,"" a spokesman for the HA said.

 ""PRH applicants who have been verified for passing the detailed vetting may also choose to apply for a Green Form Certificate (GFC) for the purchase of an SSF flat of the HA or the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) in lieu of PRH allocation,"" the spokesman added.

Pricing

 The discount rate for GSH flats offered under GSH 2024 will be set at a 40 per cent discount from the assessed market values (i.e. for sale at 60 per cent of the assessed market values). The selling prices of the flats in Wang Chi Court range from about $1.15 million to $3.49 million with an average selling price of about $2.47 million.

 ""Based on the average flat selling price at about $2.47 million (saleable area of about 34 sq m or about 366 sq ft), the mortgage payment is about $10,500 per month, assuming that buyer takes out a mortgage at 95 per cent of the flat price for a term of 30 years at an interest rate of 3.5 per cent. For one to two-person flats, the average selling price is about $1.28 million and the mortgage payment is about $5,500 per month,"" the spokesman said.

Priority for flat selection and quota

  Affected tenants of the HA's announced PRH clearance projects (i.e. Pik Hoi House, Kam Pik House and Tan Fung House of Choi Hung Estate, and Wah On House and Wah Lok House of Wah Fu Estate) who would like to purchase an SSF in lieu of PRH will be accorded priority in flat selection over other applicants under GSH 2024 (see Annex 2).

 A quota of 1 050 GSH flats will be set for families applying under the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members and Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme (Priority Newborns Scheme) for GSH 2024.Family applicants with babies born on or after October 25, 2023, will be eligible for the Priority Newborns Scheme if their children are aged 3 or below on the closing day of the application of GSH 2024. Separately, a quota of 250 GSH flats will be set for one-person applicants.

Application arrangements

Valid GF applicants of Sale of Home Ownership Scheme Flats 2024 who have given consent to carry over their applications to GSH 2024 do not need to submit fresh application or pay the application fee for GSH 2024 again. Balloting for GSH 2024 is expected to be held in the third/fourth quarter this year and flat selection is expected to start from the fourth quarter of the year.

 Starting from tomorrow (July 10), application forms, application guides, and sales booklets/leaflets will be available on the HA/HD's designated GSH 2024 website: www.housingauthority.gov.hk/gsh/2024, while printed copies can be obtained during the opening hours from the office of the HA's GSH Sales Unit in Kwun Tong (GSH Sales Office), the HA Customer Service Centre in Lok Fu, estate offices and District Tenancy Management Offices of the HA, rental estate offices of the HKHS and the Home Affairs Enquiry Centres.

立法會十三題：善用公共房屋資源,2025-07-09 16:52,2025-07-09 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900427.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳凱欣議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

根據房屋署的最新資料，截至今年三月底，在過去十二個月獲安排入住公共租住房屋公屋（公屋）的一般申請者的平均輪候時間維持在5.3年，反映公屋供應依然嚴重短缺。然而，香港申訴專員公署於二○二三年曾就房屋署於一九八○年代推出的「長者住屋」及「改建一人單位」展開主動調查，指出有關單位因設計上需共用浴室及廚房等設施，設計不合時宜，導致該等單位的空置率持續高企，未能有效運用公共房屋資源。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時全港長者住屋單位（即（i）一型設計長者住屋、（ii）二型設計長者住屋、（iii）三型設計長者住屋，以及（iv）改建一人單位）的以下資料：（a）總數、（b）空置數目，以及（c）所屬公共屋邨的名稱；

（二）現時第（一）項所述各類長者住屋單位的空置單位情況為何，並按空置期（即（i）一年以下、（ii）一年至兩年以下、（iii）兩年至五年以下、（iv）五年至十年以下，以及（v）十年以上）列出分項數字；

（三）過去三年獲編配各類長者住屋的總人數，以及當中拒絕接納編配相關單位的人數分別為何，並按申請者類別（即（i）參與「特快公屋編配計劃」人士及（ii）沒有參與該計劃人士）列出分項數字；

（四）鑑於當局收回一型設計長者住屋及改建一人單位，並將該等單位還原為可容納六人以上的公屋單位，過去五年，每年當局收回並改建的單位數目，以及所涉的公共屋邨名稱為何；及

（五）當局會否考慮將部分長者住屋改建為其他用途，例如簡約公屋、臨時收容中心或其他形式的中轉屋，以紓緩公屋的輪候壓力；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

房屋署在一九八○年代推出「長者住屋」，為年滿60歲或以上的長者提供院舍式公共租住房屋。「長者住屋」按單位的設計分為一型、二型及三型三個類別。至於設計與一型設計單位相近的「改建一人單位」，則是因應當時社會對一人公屋單位的需求而設。

隨着時代變遷，市民對生活環境、私隱等方面要求有所改變，上述「長者住屋」及「改建一人單位」的租戶需共用廚房及／或浴室，有關單位已變得不合時宜。香港房屋委員會（房委會）檢視「長者住屋」及「改建一人單位」的情況後，已推出多項措施，包括全面放寬「長者住屋」租戶的年齡限制、停止編配一型設計「長者住屋」及「改建一人單位」，並鼓勵有關租戶調遷以收回並改建該些單位為一般公屋單位出租，以改善有關單位的空置情況。截至二○二五年五月底，一型設計「長者住屋」分隔房間的數目已由二○○六年約5600個大幅減少至現時只有369個（涉及約140個公屋單位）；而「改建一人單位」分隔房間則由二○○○年約5800個大幅減少至現時只有258個（涉及約100個公屋單位），共佔全港八十多萬個公屋單位僅0.03%。現時居於一型設計「長者住屋」全屬長者戶，當中超過八成為80歲或以上的長者租戶，而居於「改建一人單位」接近九成半為長者租戶，當中超過四成為80歲或以上的長者租戶，由於大部分住戶年事已高，我們會繼續以情理兼備及體恤的態度處理他們的住屋需要。

就陳凱欣議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）有關「長者住屋」及「改建一人單位」的房間／單位總數及空置數目載列於附件一；所屬屋邨／屋苑載列於附件二。

（二）有關「長者住屋」單位的空置期的資料載列於附件三。

（三）過去三個年度，「長者住屋」公屋申請者獲編配的數目及相關拒絕編配的數目分類載列於附件四。

（四）過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年期間），由一型設計「長者住屋」及「改建一人單位」還原至一般公屋單位的數目及所屬屋邨／屋苑載列於附件五。

（五）政府和房委會的宗旨，是為沒有能力租住私人樓宇的低收入家庭提供公共租住房屋。現有的公屋資源（包括「長者住屋」）應盡量按既定機制編配予正輪候公屋的家庭或人士居住，以更直接和長遠地應付他們的住屋需要。根據現行政策，現有的臨時收容中心及中轉房屋目標為應付臨時及過渡性安置需求，而目前的供應足以應付需求。我們目前沒有計劃將有關空置單位改建為臨時收容中心或中轉房屋。

「簡約公屋」至今進展良好，今年內已共有約9 500個單位陸續落成啓用，而在二○二六年及二○二七年年初則分別將有約20 300個及餘下約200個單位相繼落成，穩步邁向在二○二七年内完成興建約30 000個「簡約公屋」單位的目標。把剩餘的少量及零散於各個屋邨的空置單位改為「簡約公屋」，並不符合經濟效益。我們會與社會福利署和社福機構緊密聯繫和合作，繼續向居住在一型設計「長者住屋」和「改建一人單位」的租戶遊說搬遷的建議及提供誘因和優惠，包括參加「長者戶全免租金計劃」可獲終生免租及有搬遷津貼；及按個別租戶的住屋情況及福利需要提供適當的支援等。"

Question:ã

 According to the latest information of the Housing Department (HD), as at the end of March this year, the average waiting time for general applicants who were housed to public rental housing (PRH) in the past 12 months maintained at 5.3 years, reflecting that PRH supply is still in severe shortage. However, the Office of The Ombudsman, Hong Kong, launched a direct investigation in 2023 into the Housing for Senior Citizens (HSC) and converted one-person (C1P) units, which were introduced by the HD in the 1980s, pointing out that these units are outdated in design due to the need to share facilities such as bathrooms and kitchens, resulting in persistently high vacancy rates and failure to make effective deployment of public housing resources. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information on HSC units (i.e. (i) HSC Type 1 design units, (ii) HSC Type 2 design units, (iii) HSC Type 3 design units, and (iv) C1P units) across the territory at present: (a) the total number, (b) the number of vacant units, and (c) the names of the PRH estates to which they belong;

(2) of the current status of the vacant units of the various types of HSC units mentioned in (1), together with a breakdown by vacancy period (i.e. (i) less than one year, (ii) one year to less than two years, (iii) two years to less than five years, (iv) five years to less than 10 years, and (v) 10 years or more);

(3) of the total number of individuals who were allocated various types of HSC units in the past three years, and among which the number of those who refused to accept the allocated units, with a breakdown by type of applicant (i.e. (i) those who joined the Express Flat Allocation Scheme (EFAS) and (ii) those who did not join EFAS);

(4) given that the authorities have recovered HSC Type 1 design units and C1P units and converted them into PRH units suitable for six persons or more, of the number of units recovered and converted in each of the past five years, as well as the names of the PRH estates involved; and

(5) whether the authorities will consider converting some HSC units for other purposes, such as Light Public Housing, temporary shelters or other forms of interim housing, so as to alleviate the demand pressure on PRH; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 In the 1980s, the Housing Department (HD) introduced the Housing for Senior Citizens (HSC) to provide hostel-type public rental housing (PRH) for elderly tenants aged 60 or above. There are three types of HSC according to the design namely Type 1 (HS1), Type 2 (HS2) and Type 3 (HS3). In addition, Converted One-Person (C1P) units, which is of similar design as HS1, were provided in response to the society's demand for one-person PRH units at that time.

 With the change of times, public expectations for living conditions and privacy are no longer the same. Tenants of HSC and C1P units have to share kitchens and/or bathrooms, and these units have become outdated and unpopular. To reduce their vacancy rates, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA), having reviewed the situation of HSC and C1P units, has taken multiple measures, such as lifting the age limit for HSC, ceasing the allocation of HS1 and C1P units and providing tenants concerned with transfer incentives with a view to recovering and converting these units into ordinary PRH flats. As at end May 2025, the number of partitioned rooms in HS1 has decreased from approximately 5 600 in 2006 to only 369 at present (involving about 140 PRH flats). Meanwhile, the number of partitioned rooms in C1P units has significantly reduced from around 5 800 in 2000 to only 258 at present (involving about 100 PRH flats), collectively accounting for only 0.03 per cent of over 800 000 PRH flats in Hong Kong. Currently, all tenants residing in HS1 are elderly households and over 80 per cent of them are aged 80 or above. Similarly, nearly 95 per cent of tenants in C1P units are elderly, of whom more than 40 per cent are aged 80 or above. Given that the majority of residents are of advanced age, we will continue to address their housing needs with both reasonableness and compassion.

 The reply in response to the questions raised by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan is as follows:

(1) The total number and vacant units of HSC and C1P units are listed in Annex 1; the respective PRH estates/courts are listed in Annex2.

(2) Information on the vacancy period of HSC units is listed in Annex 3.

(3) The total number of PRH applicants who were allocated HSC units, and the number of refusals in the past three years are listed in Annex 4.

(4) The number of HS1 and C1P units converted into ordinary PRH flats in the past five years (from 2020 to 2024) and the respective PRH estates/courts are listed in Annex 5.

(5) It is the objective of the Government and the HA to provide PRH to low-income families who cannot afford private rental accommodation. Existing PRH resources (including HSC) should, as far as possible, be allocated to families or individuals on the PRH waiting list in accordance with established mechanisms to address their housing needs more directly and sustainably. Under the current policy, the purpose of existing transit centres and interim housing aim to meet temporary and transitional housing needs, and the current supply is sufficient to meet the demand. Currently, we have no plan to convert the vacant units into transit centre or interim housing.

 The Light Public Housing (LPH) initiative has progressed well, with about 9500 units completed for intake this year, and around 20300 units and the remaining 200 units expected to be completed by 2026 and early 2027 respectively, steadily moving towards the goal of completing about 30000 LPH units by 2027. Converting the remaining small and scattered vacant units across various estates into LPH is not cost-effective. We will continue to work closely with the Social Welfare Department and social welfare organisations to encourage tenants residing in HS1 and C1P units to consider transfer by offering incentives and benefits, including joining the ""Full Rent Exemption Scheme for Elderly Households"" to enjoy lifetime rent exemption and domestic removal allowance, and appropriate support provided based on individual housing and welfare needs."
陝西秦漢文明教師考察之旅　教師分享考察成果（附圖）,2025-07-09 16:45,2025-07-09 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900237.htm,"康樂及文化事務署弘揚中華文化辦公室（弘揚辦）及教育局合辦陝西秦漢文明教師考察之旅，在六月二十七日至七月一日帶領二十三名中學中國歷史科教師到西安多家重點博物館及文博機構參觀交流，進行實地考察和親身體驗，並近距離觀察珍貴文物。這些經驗有助教師豐富教學內容，提升學生對中國歷史的興趣，推動傳承中華文化。

為期五天的考察團由陝西省文物局統籌，參觀的博物館多為新建成或擴建重開，讓教師認識當地最新的博物館資源。行程包括到秦始皇帝陵博物院參觀兵馬俑及銅車馬，了解其製作工藝及歷史涵義；走訪漢景帝陽陵博物院、陝西考古博物館及秦咸陽宮遺址考古基地，從考古角度解讀文物及遺址；參觀陝西歷史博物館秦漢館，近距離觀賞神獸金飾和彩繪雁魚銅燈等鎮館之寶，以及飽覽西安碑林博物館收藏的歷代碑石、墓誌和石刻造像。

此外，教師參加不同的工作坊，嘗試進行金箔紋飾貼畫創作及兵馬俑模型修復，並透過穿漢服學漢禮體驗，感受漢代的禮儀文化。考察團亦參觀了今年開幕的西部機場博物館，欣賞運用嶄新多媒體技術展出的當地出土古代文化遺存。以上經驗能夠令教師從多角度加深對秦漢歷史和中華文化的認識。

陝西文博機構的專家和學者亦特別介紹其教育服務，並與香港教師探討如何利用相關資源支援教學，以及如何利用文物說故事，融入日常課堂，令歷史教育變得更生動有趣。

教師會就考察團活動所得製成教案，在課堂上應用，並構思課堂以外的配套教育活動。

考察團是「中國通史系列」第二個展覽「香港賽馬會呈獻系列：天下一統—陝西秦漢文明展」的配套活動，展覽剛於七月七日完結，深受市民及旅客歡迎，共吸引超過二十五萬人次參觀。弘揚辦將精選部分展覽內容製作成虛擬展覽，於七月內上載弘揚辦及香港歷史博物館網頁予觀眾網上重温。詳情請留意弘揚辦網頁www.ccpo.gov.hk/tc及社交媒體平台：

Participants of teacher study tour to Shaanxi on ancient civilisation of Qin and Han dynasties share experiences and achievements (with photos),2025-07-09 16:45,2025-07-09 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900241.htm,"Co-organised by the Chinese Culture Promotion Office (CCPO) of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Education Bureau (EDB), a teacher study tour to Shaanxi on the ancient civilisation of the Qin and Han dynasties was held from June 27 to July 1, leading 23 secondary school Chinese history teachers to visit various major museums and cultural institutions in Xi'an. Through site visits and personal experiences, teachers were able to closely observe precious artefacts of the Qin and Han dynasties. This experience will enrich the teachers' teaching content, thereby enhancing Hong Kong students' interest in learning about Chinese history and promoting the passing on of Chinese culture.

The five-day study tour was co-ordinated by the Shaanxi Provincial Cultural Heritage Administration. Most of the museums visited were newly built or expanded, allowing the teachers to learn about the latest museum resources in Shaanxi Province. The itinerary included visiting the terracotta warriors and bronze chariots at the Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum to understand their craftmanship and historical significance; interpreting relics and historical sites from the archaeological perspective when visiting the Hanyangling Museum, the Shaanxi Archaeology Museum and the Qin Xianyang Palace Relic Site; appreciating highlighted exhibits such as the ""Gold decoration in the shape of spiritual animal"" and the ""Painted Bronze Lamp in the shape of a Wild Goose Carrying a Fish"" at the Qin Han Museum of the Shaanxi History Museum; and viewing stone tablet, epitaph and rock inscription collections of the Xi'an Beilin Museum.

Moreover, the teachers joined a number of workshops to try their hand at creating gold leaf decorative paintings and restoring terracotta warrior models. They also experienced Han etiquette through wearing traditional Han clothing (Hanfu), immersing themselves in the ceremonial culture of the Han dynasty. In addition, they visited the newly opened Western Airport Museum, where they admired ancient cultural relics unearthed on-site, showcased through cutting-edge multimedia technology. These experiences deepened their understanding of the history of the Qin and Han dynasties and Chinese culture from various perspectives.

The scholars and experts from the cultural institutions in Shaanxi specifically introduced their educational services. They also discussed with Hong Kong teachers how to utilise relevant resources to support teaching and how to incorporate storytelling with artefacts into daily lessons, making history education more engaging and interesting.

Teachers are required to prepare a lesson plan with learnings from the tour and apply them in their lessons, as well as design extension programmes for extra-curricular activities.

The tour is an extension activity of the second exhibition of the General History of China Series, ""The Hong Kong Jockey Club Series: The Great Unity - Civilisation of the Qin and Han Dynasties in Shaanxi Province"" exhibition, which ended on July 7. The exhibition was widely welcomed by the local public and visitors, and received more than 250 000 visitors. The CCPO will produce a virtual exhibition featuring selected exhibition content, which will be uploaded to the websites of the CCPO and the Hong Kong Museum of History in July for online revisits. For details, please visit the website of the CCPO at www.ccpo.gov.hk/en and social media platforms: www.facebook.com/CCPOHK (Facebook), www.instagram.com/ccpo.hk/ (Instagram), www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/6654afd400000000070074da (Xiaohongshu).

The study tour is one of the activities of the Chinese History and Culture - Train-the-Trainer Workshops, co-organised by the CCPO and the EDB, as well as the Chinese Culture Promotion Series."

Question:

 âIt is indicated in the Budget for this financial year that the average annual capital works expenditure will grow from about $90 billion to about $120 ‍billion over the next five years. Some members of the land development and construction industries hope that the expenditure will not be biased in favour of infrastructure and civil engineering works at the expense of building works and consultancy projects, such as those relating to planning, design, transport and the environment. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council of:

(1) the estimated capital works expenditure and the actual expenditure for each year from the 2020-2021 financial year to the 2024-2025 financial year, with a breakdown by project type (i.e. ‍(i) ‍infrastructure/civil engineering works, (ii) building works, and (iii) consultancy projects);

(2) the estimated capital works expenditure for each year from 2025-‍2026 financial year to 2029-2030 financial year, with a breakdown by the project types mentioned in (1); and

(3) the measures in place to ensure that the overall capital works expenditure does not unduly favour a certain type of work or project, in order to promote more balanced and comprehensive land development and construction in Hong Kong?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been implementing public works projects in a timely and orderly manner with a view to improving people's quality of living, enhancing the long-term competitiveness and promoting the economic development of Hong Kong. The Government's Budget for this financial year pointed out that, with projects related to the Northern Metropolis being rolled out progressively, as well as other infrastructure projects related to the economy and people's livelihood, the capital works expenditure will start reaching its peak. In the medium forecast range (in future five years), the capital works expenditure is expected to increase from the estimated $90 billion per annum on average last year to about $120 billion per annum on average in future.

 My responses to the Member's question are as follows:

(1) From the financial year 2020-2021 to 2024-2025, the annual estimated and actual capital works expenditure by project category are tabulated as follows:

Note 2: We do not have the estimate on the annual consultancy fees and remuneration of resident site staff. Based on past data, they generally account for about 2.7 per cent and 5.7 per cent of the total annual project expenditure respectively.

(2) Based on the medium range forecast, the estimated capital works expenditure is about $120 billion per annum on average from the financial year 2025-2026 to 2029-2030. In the financial year 2025-26, the estimated capital works expenditure is $119.8 billion, of which the estimate on building projects and infrastructure/civil projects are about $61.9 billion and $57.9 billion respectively. The above estimates include consultancy fees accounting for about 2.7 per cent (about $3.2 billion) and remuneration of resident site staff accounting for about 5.7 per cent (about $6.8 billion). The annual estimates will be subsequently planned in the annual Budget taking into account factors including Hong Kong's overall economic conditions, Government's fiscal position, prioritisation of proposed capital works projects, progress of existing projects and overall resource allocation, etc. Hence, we are currently unable to specify the estimated expenditure for various project categories beyond the financial year 2025-26.

(3) Based on the data in item (1) above, the proportion of actual expenditure on building projects to total actual expenditure on capital works projects has increased in recent years. The Government will continue to review the cost-effectiveness of projects, prioritise them according to urgency, and implement the relevant projects in a timely and orderly manner. The projects currently being implemented or planned by the Government cover a wide range of categories, including land planning and development, transport infrastructure, healthcare, cultural and recreational facilities, social welfare, education, drainage, sewerage, water supply, waste disposal, and heritage conservation, etc."
LCQ22: Support for public rental housing tenants,2025-07-09 16:05,2025-07-09 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900452.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Kingsley Wong and a written reply by Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

It has been learnt that a number of cases involving deaths of public rental housing (PRH) tenants in their own PRH flats occurred in Hong Kong in the past, in which the deaths of such tenants remained unknown for a long time, and there were even cases where their bodies had been reduced to skeletons by the time they were discovered; and there were also cases in which carers died suddenly in their PRH flats, but the relatives living with them were forced to ""stay with the dead bodies"" as their relatives were unable to seek assistance and report to the Police due to mental incapacity or other reasons. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of cases in each of the past 10 years, in which staff of the Housing Department (HD) found people dead in the flats concerned during home visits or flat recovery work (e.g. breaking into the flats concerned);

(2) of the number of cases in each of the past 10 years, in which the Social Welfare Department (SWD) found people dead in the flats concerned in the course of following up the welfare service matters of PRH tenants;

(3) it is learnt that, following the default on rental payment for two consecutive months by PRH tenants, HD will make several attempts to contact the tenants concerned by means of telephone, written notification or home visits, etc., of the criteria adopted by HD for determining whether it is necessary to refer the cases to other departments for follow-up or to report to the Police after repeated unsuccessful attempts to contact the tenants;

(4) regarding cases in which HD is unable to contact the tenants successfully, whether HD will consider seeking assistance from the Police within a shorter period of time, so as to decide if further actions will be taken in respect of the tenants concerned (e.g. breaking into the flats); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) as there are views that enhanced cooperation among different departments will facilitate early detection of death cases in PRH flats and even save lives, whether HD, SWD, the Home Affairs Department and the Police will consider setting up a mechanism for information sharing and cooperation; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(6) whether it will promote and encourage the District Services and Community Care Teams (Care Teams), management companies and PRH tenants to set up a system for assuring safety, so that PRH tenants who live alone or need relevant support may participate on a voluntary basis;

(7) given that HD has launched the pilot scheme of Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households to equip the elderly households who have voluntarily participated in the scheme with the system which allows designated relatives or friends to keep track of the movement of the elderly in and out of their flats, whether the authorities will extend the scheme to cover non-elderly PRH tenants in the future; whether they will promote and encourage the Care Teams and management companies to become one of the designated contact persons, so as to expeditiously follow up the situation of the tenants concerned; and

(8) given that the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions and the Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited have joined forces to launch the Gas Guardian Care Network programme, which utilises smart meters to monitor the gas usage patterns of the elderly in real-time, whether the authorities will make reference to the programme and launch other projects in collaboration with the business sector and community organisations to enable carers to check the condition of the elderly, so as to enhance home safety of the elderly?

Reply:

President,

The estate management staff of the Housing Department (HD) will contact public rental housing (PRH) tenants through daily management work, proactively understanding their living conditions in PRH units and will pay special attention to elderly residents living alone. Cases will be referred to other government departments and social welfare organisations as needed to provide assistance.

In response to the question raised by the Hon Kingsley Wong, in consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Home Affairs Department, our reply is as follows:

(1), (2) and (5) In the past 10 years (i.e. 2015 to 2024), the number of natural deaths recorded in PRH units under the HD is listed in the Annex. These cases are mainly discovered through the HD's routine management work (such as patrols, home visits, flat recovery operations, etc.), or were reported by the tenants' relatives, friends, or neighbours to the estate offices, or referred by other government departments including the police and the Social Welfare Department (SWD) or social welfare organisations. The HD does not maintain statistical breakdowns of the means by which these cases are discovered.

At present, the HD and the SWD have established an inter-departmental referral mechanism to handle special cases of housing assistance for PRH tenants. Liaison groups have been formed at both the headquarters and regional levels to regularly review and improve the cooperation mechanism for housing assistance cases. The HD is also closely collaborating with the LWB and is providing information of PRH tenants under the premise of protecting personal data privacy, with a view to facilitating the LWB to develop a database for following up on hidden and needy elderly individuals.

(3) and (4) According to Section 19(1)(b) of the Housing Ordinance (Cap. 283), when the Housing Authority (HA) serves a notice-to-quit to tenant, at least one month's notice for termination of tenancy should be given. Upon expiry of the notice, if the occupier still does not voluntarily surrender the unit, the HD can then deploy staff to proceed flat recovery action in accordance with the Housing Ordinance. For rent arrears cases, a series of actions will be taken initially by the HD before serving notice-to-quit, including communicating with tenants through home visits, phone calls or face-to-face interviews. If the tenants still cannot be reached, HD staff will try to reach their relatives and emergency contacts. For some singleton elderly tenants who live by themselves and have not provided any relatives or other contact persons, we will make every effort to contact them through alternative means, including slipping notes through the door gap and into the letter box to ask the tenants to contact the estate office as soon as possible, instructing security guards to monitor the tenants' entry into and exit from the building, and recording their water and electricity consumption to more closely monitor their situation. If the tenants are in rent arrears due to financial difficulties, cases may be referred to the SWD for follow-up or be provided with assistance to apply for Rent Assistance Scheme, subject to their consent and fulfilment of eligibilities. If the tenants or any of their relatives still cannot be reached despite multiple attempts, the HD will inquire with other departments such as the SWD to check if the tenants are their care cases and their latest situation; or the Immigration Department to check the tenants' immigration records, etc.; and will seek assistance from the police if necessary. In addition, if HD staff discover suspicious cases during daily management work (e.g. unusual odours emanating from the unit), they will notify the police immediately to take appropriate action, including breaking into the unit as necessary.

(6), (7) and (8) In order to encourage property management companies and security service contractors to be more proactive in assisting PRH tenants in need, we give bidders who can provide effective suggestions for caring the tenants, e.g. establishing volunteer teams to provide volunteer services to the community in the estate and to visit the elderly or individuals/ families in need, etc., additional marks during the tender evaluation, thereby increasing their chances of winning the bid. In addition, the HD organises the annual Estate Management Services Contractor Awards and the Best Security Staff election to commend service contractors and security personnel who have performed well and actively assisted needy residents in the estate. This aims to encourage them to go the extra mile and take the initiative to care for the estates' PRH residents.

Starting from April this year, the HD launched the pilot scheme of Door Sensor Installation for Elderly Households in Wan Hon Estate in Kwun Tong and Sheung Lok Estate in Ho Man Tin. The elderly households who voluntarily participate in the scheme are equipped with the system which allows designated relatives or friends to keep track of the movement of the elderly in and out of their flats so as to provide timely support when needed. The HD will actively explore the feasibility of implementing other similar schemes in collaboration with other government departments and social welfare organisations, with a view to benefitting more elderly households in other PRH estates.

In addition, the HA also provides subsidies to eligible elderly tenants for the installation of emergency alarm system (Safety Bell), allowing the tenants to seek help timely in case of emergencies. Elderly tenants who require to install Safety Bell but are not receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance can apply for the Emergency Alarm System (EAS) Grant from the HA. Since February 2021, the grant has been extended to mobile devices, including mobile phones and watches equipped with EAS, smartphones with dedicated EAS mobile app installed and other products, allowing elderly tenants to purchase suitable emergency alarm system products on their own. Since the implementation of the grant scheme, approximately 26000 applications have been approved. The HD has also installed fall detection systems in accessible toilets in some housing estates on a pilot basis to detect situations such as falls, fainting, prolonged stays, etc.

The estate offices under the HA actively assist the Care Teams in promoting care activities, organising community events and providing visits and services to families in need (including elderly households). In addition, the HA collaborates with non-governmental organisations annually to organise activities in various PRH estates. These activities include outreach visits to identify elderly singleton and hidden elders, providing them with support services such as meal delivery, home repair and cleaning services, escort service for medical appointments, etc., so as to help them maintain basic living needs, expand their social networks and provide emotional support.

The HA will continue to implement the aforementioned measures and will conduct timely reviews, striving to meet the needs of tenants."
​立法會二十二題：支援公共租住房屋租戶,2025-07-09 16:05,2025-07-09 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900451.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）立法會會議上黃國議員的提問和房屋局局長何永賢的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉本港過去曾發生多宗公共租住房屋（公屋）住戶在其單位內死亡，但長時間未被他人發現的個案，更有遺體被發現時已化成骸骨；亦有照顧者在公屋單位內猝死，但其同住親屬因精神上無行為能力或其他原因而未能向外求助及報警而被迫「伴屍」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去十年每年房屋署人員在進行家訪或執行收回單位工作（例如破門入屋）時，發現有人在相關單位內死亡的個案宗數為何；

（二）過去十年每年社會福利署（社署）因跟進公屋住戶的福利服務事宜時，發現有人在相關單位內死亡的個案宗數為何；

（三）據悉在公屋住戶連續欠租兩個月後，房屋署會多次透過電話聯絡、書面通知或進行家訪等方式嘗試聯絡相關住戶，房屋署在多次嘗試仍未能成功聯絡該等住戶後，將以何準則決定需否轉介其他部門跟進或報警；

（四）就未能成功聯絡住戶的個案，房屋署會否考慮在更短時間內向警方尋求協助，以決定是否向該等單位採取進一步行動（例如破門入屋）；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（五）鑑於有意見認為不同部門間若能夠加強合作，有助及早發現公屋單位內的死亡個案，甚至挽回人命，房屋署、社署、民政事務總署及警方會否考慮設立資料互通及合作機制；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（六）會否推動和鼓勵地區服務及關愛隊伍（關愛隊）、管理公司及公屋租戶設立「報平安」制度，讓獨居或有需要的公屋租戶可自願參與；

（七）鑑於房屋署正試行「長者住戶大門開關訊息系統」，為自願參與的長者住戶安裝系統，以協助長者指定的親友了解住戶進出居所的情況，當局未來會否將該計劃擴展至非長者公屋住戶；會否推動和鼓勵關愛隊及管理公司成為「指定聯絡人」之一，以便快速跟進相關住戶的情況；及

（八）鑑於香港工會聯合會與香港中華煤氣有限公司合作推出「燃點生活護聯網」計劃，利用智能煤氣錶實時觀測長者的用氣習慣，當局會否借鑒該計劃，聯同商界及社會團體推出其他計劃讓照顧者可查看長者的情況，以提升他們的家居安全？

答覆：

主席：

房屋署的屋邨管理人員會透過日常管理工作接觸公共租住房屋（公屋）租戶，主動了解他們在公屋單位的住用情況，並會特別關注獨居長者，按需要適時轉介個案予其他政府部門及社福機構以提供援助。

就黃國議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局和民政事務總署，現回覆如下：

（一）、（二）及（五）過去十年（即二○一五至二○二四年），房屋署在轄下公屋單位內錄得自然身故的個案數目載列於附件。上述的個案主要透過房屋署日常管理工作（例如巡樓、家訪、收房行動等），或由住戶的親友或鄰居等人士通知屋邨辦事處，或由其他政府部門包括警方及社會福利署（社署）或社福機構轉介發現。房屋署並沒有備存獲悉個案的途徑的分項統計數字。

現時，房屋署和社署設有跨部門的轉介機制處理公屋租戶房屋援助的特別個案，並在總部及地區層面成立聯絡小組，定期檢視和改善房屋援助個案的合作機制。房屋署亦正與勞工及福利局緊密聯繫，在保障個人資料私隱的前提下，提供公屋住戶資料，以便勞工及福利局建立資料庫跟進隱蔽及需要照顧的長者個案。

（三）及（四）根據《房屋條例》（第283章）第19（1）（b）條，當香港房屋委員會（房委會）向租戶發出「遷出通知書」，須給予租戶最少一個月期限的遷出通知終止租約。在通知期屆滿後，如佔用人仍未主動交回單位，房屋署才可按《房屋條例》派員到單位執行收回單位行動。就公屋租戶欠租而言，房屋署在發出「遷出通知書」前，會先採取一系列行動，包括透過家訪、電話或面談，與欠租租戶溝通。若仍無法聯繫欠租租戶，房屋署職員會嘗試聯絡其親友和聯絡人。而部分長者住客並沒有留下任何的親友或其他可聯絡的人士，對於這一類獨居獨身住戶，我們會盡量採用其他方式嘗試與他們接觸，包括將便條透過門縫放進單位內及放入信箱通知住戶盡快聯絡屋邨辧事處、着保安員留意住戶的進出大廈情況，以及記錄住戶的水電用量等，以更緊密的留意他們的情況。如租戶因經濟困難而欠租，房屋署可按其意願及資格，轉介其至社署跟進，或協助其申請「租金援助計劃」。若多番嘗試後仍未能聯絡租戶或其任何親友，房屋署會向其他部門查詢，例如向社署查詢租戶是否其照顧個案及最新情況；或向入境事務處查詢有關租戶的出入境紀錄等；如有需要亦會向警方尋求協助。此外，若房屋署職員在進行日常管理工作時發現可疑個案（如單位傳出異味），會即時通知警方採取適當行動，包括按情況破門入屋。

（六）、（七）及（八）為鼓勵物業管理公司及護衞服務承辦商更主動協助有需要的公屋租戶，凡投標者在競投物業管理服務合約或護衞服務合約時，能提供關懷租戶的有效建議，例如設立義工團隊，提供義工服務給邨內社區、探訪長者或有需要人士／家庭等，在評審標書時會獲得額外分數，增加其中標的機會。此外，房屋署每年舉辦「屋邨管理服務承辦商大獎」，並設有「最佳護衞員工」選舉，以嘉許在工作上有良好表現及積極協助邨內有需要住戶的服務承辦商和護衞員，藉以鼓勵他們主動關懷屋邨內的住戶。

房屋署在今年四月開始，在觀塘雲漢邨及何文田常樂邨，試行「長者住戶大門開關訊息系統」計劃，為自願參與的長者住戶安裝系統，讓他們指定的親友，掌握有關長者進出居所的情況，及時提供適切支援。房屋署會積極研究與其他政府部門及社福機構推行其他類似計劃的可行性，以推展至其他公共屋邨，惠及更多住戶。

另外，房委會亦向合資格長者住戶提供津貼安裝「平安鐘」，讓住戶遇到緊急事故時可以迅速求助。需要安裝「平安鐘」而非領取綜合社會保障援助的長者租戶，可向房委會申領緊急警報系統津貼。津貼計劃於二○二一年二月起擴展至流動設備，包括具備緊急警報系統的手機和手錶、安裝專用應用程式的智能電話及其他產品等，以便長者租戶自行選購適合的緊急警報系統。津貼計劃推行以來已批出約26000宗申請。房屋署亦已在部分屋邨的暢通易達洗手間內以試點形式安裝智能監測跌倒系統，以偵測跌倒、暈厥或停留過久等情況。

房委會轄下各公共屋邨辦事處積極協助關愛隊推展關愛活動，籌劃社區活動及為有需要的家庭（包括長者戶）提供探訪及服務等。此外，房委會各屋邨每年均夥拍非政府機構舉辦活動，活動範疇包括外展探訪，以識別獨居及隱蔽租戶，為他們提供支援服務，例如送飯服務、家居維修服務和清潔、出外就醫的接送服務等，以幫助他們維持基本生活需要、擴闊社交圈子及提供情緒支援。

房委會會繼續推行上述各項措施，並會適時作出檢討，致力配合住戶的需要。"

在啓動禮上，金融監管機構、科技公司和電訊公司的高層人員就金融騙案趨勢，及各方如何合作共同打擊詐騙及欺詐進行了深入討論。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「打擊金融詐騙與欺詐及保護市民需要公私營機構及廣大社會攜手合作，團結一致。《約章3.0》標誌着這項努力的重要里程碑，匯集金融、科技和電訊行業的力量，為公眾提供更好的保障。」

證監會行政總裁梁鳳儀表示：「《約章3.0》得到主要科技與電訊公司參與，是攜手打擊網絡詐騙的重要一步。從源頭上堵截欺詐風險是我們共同的責任。《約章3.0》不僅響應全球政府部門和監管機構的反詐呼籲，也鞏固香港在維護金融領域數碼化發展的領導位置。讓我們一起以嚴謹、協作及公眾信任為核心，建立一個更安全、更負責任的網絡環境。」

保監局行政總監張雲正表示：「《約章3.0》代表各主要持份者共同合作的成果，旨在打造一個穩健而強韌的聯盟以防範金融騙案和詐騙。保監局將利用這個平台加強公眾教育及提升保單持有人的能力，以有效防範騙徒日益精密的犯案手法。」

積金局行政總監鄭恩賜表示：「強積金是打工仔女累積的珍貴退休儲備，積金局絕不姑息任何損害強積金退休儲蓄的詐騙行為。我們樂見各金融監管機構、執法部門和相關機構透過《約章3.0》，與多間主要科技和電訊公司一起打擊詐騙行為及加強防騙宣傳。我們呼籲打工仔女保持警覺，與我們攜手，積極舉報疑似騙案，保障自己的強積金權益。」"

The Charter 3.0 introduces six key principles (see Annex), focusing on the reporting of suspected financial fraud and scams, checking of advertisers, internal monitoring processes, enforcement of terms of service, and collaboration on public education and awareness.

During the launch event, executives from financial regulators, technology firms and telecommunications firms engaged in productive discussions on the latest trends of financial fraud and scams as well as their collaborative efforts for the common purpose of combatting such fraud and scams.

The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, said, ""The fight against financial fraud and scams and to protect the public requires a united front, bringing together the public and private sectors, as well as the community at large. The Charter 3.0 represents a significant milestone in this endeavour, harnessing the collective strength of the financial, technology, and telecommunications industries to better safeguard the public.""

Together, we are building a safer, more responsible online landscape that prioritises vigilance, collaboration, and public trust.""

The Chief Executive Officer of the IA, Mr Clement Cheung,said, ""The Charter 3.0 represents the outcome of collaborative efforts made by key stakeholders in forging a robust and resilient alliance to prevent financial fraud and scams. The IA will leverage on this platform to strengthen public education and empower policy holders so that they can safeguard effectively against the increasingly sophisticated plots concocted by swindlers.""

The Managing Director of the MPFA, Mr Cheng Yan-chee,said, ""MPF is the valuable retirement reserve accumulated by the working population. The MPFA will not tolerate any fraudulent activities that undermine their retirement savings in MPF.

問題：

政府於一九九八年發表《香港長遠房屋策略白皮書》，為提升市民擁有自置居所訂立具體指標，以期在二○○七年年底前，全港七成家庭能擁有自置居所，但政府於二○○二年因重新定位其房屋政策而放棄該目標。而政府於二○一四年公布新的《長遠房屋策略》（《策略》）後，至今也再無提出訂立家庭自置居所比率的目標。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（四）目前有哪些具體措施鼓勵市民自置居所，以及有關措施的效果為何？

答覆:

主席：

香港的房屋政策一直是社會發展的重要基石。本屆政府從土地供應着手，在各環節提量、提速、提效、提質。在這三年不懈努力下，公營房屋（包括公共租住房屋（公屋）和資助出售單位）落成量已完全扭轉了「頭輕尾重」的情況。連同「簡約公屋」在內，未來五年（二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度）總體公營房屋（亦包括公屋和資助出售單位）供應量將達197 000伙，較本屆政府上任時的五年期（二○二二／二三至二○二六／二七年度）大幅增加了85%。此外，我們亦成功將輪候公屋的時間封頂，由高峰6.1年下降至5.3年。「居者有其屋計劃」（居屋）的超額認購倍數已由「居屋2019」最高的62倍大幅下降至「居屋2024」的14倍。展望未來，隨着各個公營房屋（包括公屋和資助出售單位）及「簡約公屋」項目陸續落成，公屋綜合輪候時間會逐步下降。因此，我們更有「底氣」提供更多資助出售單位，進一步滿足市民的置業需求。

現時，約一半的住戶居住在自己擁有的物業。對大部分市民而言，置業是人生重要的決定，涉及多方面的考慮，例如家庭及子女生育計劃、對更獨立的現代生活方式的追求等。對於未能負擔私樓的中低收入人士而言，資助出售單位是他們實現置業夢想非常合適的第一步，因此我們一直致力完善房屋階梯，透過提供不同種類的資助出售單位，回應不同收入家庭的置業願望，鼓勵各個階層的市民按自己的能力上進上流。

就洪雯議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局和政府統計處，我們現回覆如下：

（一）和（二）有關過去10年本港家庭住戶自置居所及相關的人口和社會經濟特徵的統計數據，可參考政府統計處「2016年中期人口統計」及「2021年人口普查」的結果。按戶主年齡組別及房屋類型劃分的自置居所家庭住戶數目列於附件一。在對上的五年間，自置居所家庭住戶數目及擁有資助出售單位的住戶數目分別上升了超過80 000戶和近30 000戶，升幅分別達6%及7%，反映更多家庭擁有了自己的物業。自置居所家庭住戶的每月收入中位數，和每月按揭供款及借貸還款中位數列於附件二。

值得注意的是，在二○一六年至二○二一年間，每個居屋銷售計劃平均只推售約4 200個單位，超額認購倍數平均高達約43倍。然而，本屆政府非常有決心解決香港的房屋問題，因此在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），除了公屋／綠表置居計劃（綠置居）單位外，香港房屋委員會（房委會）和香港房屋協會將會有約56 500個資助出售單位落成，即每年平均約11 000個單位，是本屆政府上任前的2.6倍。

（三）及（四）正如上述所言，本屆政府非常有決心解決香港的房屋問題，我們亦十分關心青年人。因此，我們推出多項政策措施，從供應、編配以及財務安排多方面協助市民（特別是青年人）實現置業夢想。自本屆政府上任以來，已有超過33 000個申請者購買資助出售單位，可見以往十多年來中低收入家庭置業難的情況，已經在本屆政府各個團隊齊心一致努力造地建屋下，被大力扭轉。隨着資助出售單位的供應未來會進一步增多，以後十年市民就更能感受到擁有自置居所後所帶來的幸福感和獲得感，更多家庭得以在這個城市安居樂業。

此外，在供應方面，行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》中已公布，房委會會調整公屋（包括綠置居）和資助出售單位的比例，由七比三逐步調整至六比四，增加資助出售單位的供應。在未來五年（即二○二五／二六至二○二九／三○年度），房委會和香港房屋協會將會有約56 500個資助出售單位落成。正如上述所指，我們相信由政府主導持續穩定地供應資助出售單位，可帶動整個房屋階梯的流轉，協助有需要的人士按各自的需要和能力實現置業夢想。

我們同時提出一系列政策措施，透過一套完整的「組合拳」滿足不同市民的住屋需要和訴求，包括將居屋綠白表比例由現時四比六調整至五比五，讓更多有意購買居屋的公屋租戶向上流；並透過優化銷售安排增加青年及屢次向隅者等人士購買資助出售單位的機會。

房委會已由「居屋2024」起，落實二○二三年《施政報告》公布推出的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」。在「居屋2024」新推售單位中，預留約四成單位作配額（即2 900個單位），供參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」和「家有長者優先選樓計劃」的合資格申請者攪珠和優先選樓。在「居屋2024」申請期內，房委會共收到約106 000份申請表，其中約50 000份屬家庭申請者，當中參加「家有長者優先選樓計劃」及「家有初生優先選樓計劃」的申請共有約19 000份，佔家庭申請者約四成。未能在「居屋2024」中成功選購單位的「家有初生優先選樓計劃」合資格家庭，只要他們的子女在日後推出的資助出售單位銷售計劃的申請截止日期時為三歲或以下，仍可參加「家有初生優先選樓計劃」而獲優先選樓。此外，房委會繼「綠置居2024」後，亦會由下一期居屋銷售計劃開始，為前兩次曾連續向隅而未能成功購買單位的申請者分派多一個抽籤號碼，以增加他們成功購買資助出售單位的機會。參考「居屋2024」的數字，假設一切因素（包括申請者人數、年齡等）不變，屢次向隅的合資格「家有初生優先選樓計劃」家庭在獲得額外一個抽籤號碼後，購買單位的成功率將提升約60%。

房委會亦一直在定價及財務安排等方面協助中低收入家庭置業。首先，政府在二○一八年修訂了資助出售單位的定價機制。資助出售單位定價是以申請人的負擔能力為計算基礎，與私人房屋市場脫鈎。在現時定價機制下，至少75%推售的單位，可讓入息水平達家庭每月入息中位數的非業主住戶家庭，動用不超過其每月入息40%作按揭供款。若以負擔能力計算的售價與評定市值比較，最新一期的綠置居及居屋分別等於以評定市值的六折及七折出售。

另外，房委會於二○二四年放寬資助出售單位的按揭貸款安排，包括將按揭保證期由最長30年延長至最長50年，及將按揭還款期由最長25年延長至最長30年，以便一、二手買家向參與提供該等單位按揭貸款的銀行和認可財務機構取得按揭貸款。在有關安排落實後，剩餘按揭保證期超過十年的居屋／綠置居單位由約14%大幅增至約98%。截至二○二五年五月，二手資助出售單位平均每月成交宗數約360宗，比落實前12個月的平均每月成交宗數約230宗，顯著上升約六成。此外，第二市場按揭還款期由最長25年延長至最長30年後，於第二市場購買資助出售單位而申請按揭的買家當中，有超過一半以上的個案的還款期為25年或以上。由此可反映以上措施成功活化第二市場和促進第二市場資助出售單位的流轉。

在第二市場方面，房委會亦已由「白表居屋第二市場計劃（白居二）2024」起，大幅增加1 500個配額至6 000個，並將新增配額全數撥予40歲以下的青年家庭及一人申請者。「白居二2024」的所有申請中，超過八成，即約28 000份申請為選擇參加「青年計劃（白居二）」的青年申請者，反映有關計劃深受青年人歡迎。

此外，政府亦透過「港人首次置業」（「首置」）項目，協助既不符合申請居屋資格、又未能負擔私營房屋的較高收入人士，回應他們的置業期望。除了市區重建局首兩個已推售的「首置」項目（即「煥然懿居」第一和第二座，以及「煥然懿居」第三座）共售出超過600個「首置」單位，政府正推展另外數個「首置」項目，於未來數年起合共提供約5 000個「首置」單位。而過去所推售「首置」單位的申請人以及最終買家，有大約八成半是40歲或以下青年。我們相信這項措施可以協助另外一批收入較高但仍未能負擔私營房屋的中層青年人置業，給他們更多不同的選擇。

因應整體樓市情況的變化，本屆政府自二○二四年二月起撤銷所有住宅物業需求管理措施；香港金融管理局亦自二○二四年十月起修訂了物業按揭貸款的逆周期宏觀審慎監管措施，將最高物業按揭成數和「供款與入息比率」上限回復至二○○九年開始實施逆周期措施以前的水平，即不論物業價值，按揭成數上限一律調整至七成，供款與入息比率上限一律調整為五成，便利不同置業需要的人士。個別人士更可按自身需要，透過按揭保險計劃借取高成數的按揭貸款，其中有固定收入的首次置業人士購置價格為1,000萬港元或以下的物業，按揭成數可高達九成，大大減輕首期負擔。

此外，為減輕購買較低價值物業人士的負擔，政府自二○二五年二月二十六日起調整買賣或轉讓住宅及非住宅物業須繳付的從價印花稅的稅階，將徵收100元物業印花稅適用的物業價值上限由300萬元提高至400萬元，對有意置業的人士有一定幫助。就資助出售單位而言，絕大部分定價都低於400萬元，買家已能受惠於上述印花稅降至100元的措施，最多可以節省達五萬九千多元。而根據稅務局的資料，在二○二五年三月至五月，住宅物業價值在300萬元以上至400萬元之間加蓋印花的買賣合約宗數共3 780宗，相比去年同期（二○二四年三月至五月）的2 183宗，顯著上升了超過七成之多。

我們會繼續按物業市場的發展、不同市民的置業需求等各項因素，持續檢視各項安排是否有優化的空間。"
LCQ10: Home ownership by public,2025-07-09 15:55,2025-07-09 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900439.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong and a written reply by the Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 The Government published A White Paper on Long Term Housing Strategy in Hong Kong in 1998, formulating specific indicators to enhance home ownership by the public, with a view to achieving a home ownership rate of 70 per cent by 2007. However, the Government abandoned this target as it re-positioned its housing policy in 2002. Following the announcement of the new Long Term Housing Strategy (LTHS) in 2014, the Government has not set any targets for the home ownership rate for households to date. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics for each year over the past 10 years on (a) the number of owner-occupied households, (b) the type of their owner-occupied flats (including (A) private housing, (B) subsidised sale flats, and (C) temporary housing), and (c) the number of households having mortgages; if so, set out in the table below a breakdown by age group (i.e. aged (i) below 35, (ii) 35 to below 45, (iii) 45 to below 55, (iv) 55 to below 65, and (v) 65 or above); if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics for each year over the past 10 years on the median monthly income and the median value of monthly mortgage repayment of local owner-occupied households; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as there are views that home ownership can enhance people's sense of belonging to community and foster strong work values, but according to a research brief published by the Legislative Council Secretariat in March 2021 and data from the Census and Statistics Department, the overall local home ownership rate and the home ownership rate among young people aged below 35 have both declined in recent years, whether the authorities will consider setting a home ownership rate afresh in LTHS in the future; if not, of the reasons for that; and

(4) of the specific measures that are currently in place to encourage home ownership in the community, and the effects of such measures?

Reply:

President,

 Hong Kong's housing policy has all along been an important cornerstone of social development. The current-term Government put in place measures to enhance quantity, speed, efficiency and quality in land production. With our unremitting efforts in the past three years, the problem of back-loaded public housing supply (including public rental housing (PRH) and subsidised sale flats (SSF)) has completely turned around. Coupled with Light Public Housing (LPH), the total public housing supply (including also PRH and SSF) in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30) will reach 197 000 units, which is a significant increase of 85 per cent as compared with the first five year period since the current-term Government took office (i.e. 2022-23 to 2026-27). In addition, we have successfully capped the waiting time for PRH, which has reduced from the peak of 6.1 years to 5.3 years. The oversubscription rate of Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) has also dropped from the peak of 62 times in HOS 2019 to 14 times in HOS 2024. Looking ahead, with the completion of various public housing (including PRH and SSF) as well as LPH projects, the Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing will gradually decline. Therefore, we have more confidence to provide more SSF to further meet the home ownership aspiration of the public.

 Currently, about half of the households are residing in accommodations that they own. For most people, buying a property is a major life decision involving many considerations, such as family and childbearing plans as well as the pursuit of a more independent and modern lifestyle, etc. For low- to middle-income persons who cannot afford private housing, SSF is a very suitable first step in realising their dream of home ownership. In this regard, we have all along been striving to enhance the housing ladder through the provision of various types of SSF in response to the home ownership aspiration of households with different income and encourage citizens from all walks of life to move up the social ladder according to their abilities.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), our reply to the questions raised by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong is as follows:

(1) and (2) Results of the 2016 Population By-census and the 2021 Population Census conducted by C&SD provide statistics regarding home ownership and related demographic and socio-economic characteristics of Hong Kong's domestic households in the past decade. The number of owner-occupier domestic households by age group of household head and type of housing are listed in Annex 1. Over the past five years, the number of owner-occupier households and households owning SSF increased by over 80 000 and nearly 30 000 respectively, representing growth rates of 6 per cent and 7 per cent. This reflects a rising trend of homeownership among families. The median monthly income and the median mortgage payment and loan repayment of owner-occupier domestic households are listed in Annex 2.

 It is worth noting that between 2016 and 2021, only an average of about 4 200 flats were put up for sale under each HOS sale exercise, and the oversubscription rate was as high as about 43 times on average. However, the current-term Government is very determined to tackle the housing problem in Hong Kong. As a result, in the coming five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), in addition to PRH/Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) flats, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS) will have a completion of about 56 500 SSF, averaging about 11 000 units annually. This is 2.6 times of the annual output before the current-term Government took office.

(3) and (4) As stated above, the current-term Government is very determined to resolve housing problem in Hong Kong and we also care about our young people. Therefore, we have introduced a number of policy measures to assist citizens (especially young people) in realising their home ownership aspiration through various aspects, such as supply, allocation and financial arrangements. Since the current-term Government took office, more than 33 000 applicants have purchased SSF, and the difficulties faced by low- and middle-income families in acquiring their own properties over the past decade or so have been clearly reversed by the concerted efforts of the various teams of the current-term Government in providing more land and housing. With the increasing supply of SSF in the coming years, more residents will experience the happiness and sense of fulfillment brought by homeownership over the next decade, enabling more families to settle securely and thrive in our city.

 In addition, in terms of supply, the Chief Executive announced in the 2024 Policy Address that the HA would adjust the ratio between PRH (including GSH units) and SSF to gradually adjust the ratio from 7:3 to 6:4 in order to increase the supply of SSF. In the next five years (i.e. 2025-26 to 2029-30), the HA and the HS will complete about 56 500 SSF. As stated above, we believe that a continuous and stable supply of SSF led by the Government is conducive to the upward mobility along the housing ladder and it will help those in need realise their dream of owning a home according to their respective needs and abilities.

 At the same time, we have also proposed a series of policy measures to meet the housing needs and demands of different citizens, including revising the ratio between Green Form and White Form in respect of HOS flats from the current 4:6 to 5:5 so as to allow more PRH tenants who would like to purchase HOS flats to move upwards; and increasing the chance of young people and applicants who have made repeated attempts to purchase SSF by optimising the sales arrangements.

 Starting from HOS 2024, the HA has implemented the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme which was announced in the 2023 Policy Address. A quota of about 40 per cent of the new flats for sale (i.e. 2 900 flats) under HOS 2024 were set aside for eligible applicants under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme and the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members for balloting and priority flat selection. During the application period of HOS 2024, the HA received a total of around 106 000 applications. Among them, around 50 000 came from family applicants, in which around 19 000 applied under the Priority Scheme for Families with Elderly Members and Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme, representing around 40 per cent of family applicants. If eligible families applying under the Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme fail to purchase a flat under HOS 2024, they may still apply under the Scheme for priority flat selection as long as their children are aged three or below on the closing day of the application of subsequent SSF sale exercises. In addition, following GSH 2024, the HA will allocate an extra ballot number to applicants who had failed to purchase a flat in the last two consecutive sale exercises starting from the next HOS exercise, so as to increase their chances of success in purchasing SSF. Based on the figures of HOS 2024, assuming all factors remain constant (including the number of applicants, their age, etc), the success rate of eligible families applying under the of Families with Newborns Flat Selection Priority Scheme in purchasing a flat will increase by about 60 per cent, after obtaining an extra ballot number.

 The HA has also been assisting low- to middle-income families in purchasing homes through pricing and financial arrangements. First of all, the Government revised the pricing mechanism of SSF in 2018. The pricing of SSF is calculated on the basis of applicants' affordability, which is delinked from the private housing market. Under the current pricing mechanism, at least 75 per cent of the flats for sale can allow non-owner occupier households earning the median monthly household income to spend no more than 40 per cent of their monthly income on mortgage payment. Based on affordability calculations, the selling prices of the flats offered under latest GSH and HOS sale exercises were set at 60 per cent and 70 per cent of their assessed market value respectively.

 On top of this, the HA relaxed mortgage arrangements for SSF in 2024, including extending the maximum mortgage default guarantee from 30 years to 50 years and extending the maximum mortgage repayment period from 25 years to 30 years to enable purchasers of first-hand and second-hand SSF to obtain mortgage loans from banks and authorised financial institutions participating in the provision of mortgage loans for such flats. After the implementation of relevant arrangements, the number of HOS/GSH flats with a residual guarantee period of more than 10 years increased substantially from about 14 per cent to about 98 per cent. As at May 2025, the average number of transactions of second-hand SSF was about 360 per month, which was about 60 per cent higher than the average number of transactions of about 230 per month in the 12 months before the implementation. Besides, after extending the maximum mortgage repayment period for flats sold under the secondary market from 25 years to 30 years, among buyers who applied for mortgages to purchase SSF in the secondary market, more than half of the cases have a repayment period of 25 years or more. This shows that the above measures have successfully revitalised the secondary market and facilitated the turnover of SSF in the secondary market.

 For the secondary market, starting from White Form Secondary Market Scheme (WSM) 2024, the HA has also significantly increased the quota by 1 500 to 6 000, all of which will be allocated to young family applicants and one-person applicants aged below 40. Of all the applications for WSM 2024, more than 80 per cent (i.e. about 28 000 applications) were from young applicants who chose to participate in Youth Scheme (WSM), reflecting that the scheme is well received by young people.

 In addition, the Government also responds to the home ownership aspirations of higher-income persons who are not eligible for the HOS and yet cannot afford private housing through Starter Homes for Hong Kong Residents (SH) projects. Apart from the first two SH projects offered for sale by the Urban Renewal Authority (i.e. eResidence Towers 1 and 2, as well as eResidence Tower 3) with a total of over 600 SH units sold, the Government is also taking forward a few other SH projects, which will provide a total of around 5 000 SH units from the next few years onwards. Amongst applicants and final purchasers of SH units offered for sale in the past, around 85 per cent were youth aged 40 or below. We believe that this initiative may help another batch of youngsters from the middle class with higher income yet still cannot afford private housing achieve home ownership with more available options.

 Having regard to changes in the overall situation of the property market, the current-term Government has since February 2024 abolished all demand-side management measures for residential properties. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has also since October 2024 adjusted the countercyclical macroprudential measures for property mortgage loans. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and debt servicing ratio (DSR) limit were reverted to the pre-2009 levels before the countercyclical macroprudential measures were first introduced, with the maximum LTV ratio for all residential properties adjusted to 70 per cent, regardless of the value of the property, and the DSR limit adjusted to 50 per cent, providing facilitation to persons with different needs for property purchase. Individuals may also obtain high LTV ratio mortgage loans through the Mortgage Insurance Programme according to their own needs. In particular, for first-time homebuyers with regular income purchasing properties priced at $10 million or below, the LTV ratio can be up to 90 per cent, which greatly reduces their down payment burden.

 Furthermore, to ease the burden on buyers of properties at lower values, the Government has since 26 February 2025 adjusted the value bands of Ad Valorem Stamp Duty payable for sale and purchase or transfer of residential and non-residential properties, raising the maximum value of properties chargeable to $100 stamp duty from $3 million and $4 million, facilitating those who wish to purchase flats. As most SSF units are priced below $4 million, buyers may benefit from the aforementioned reduction in stamp duty to $100, with savings up to over $59 000. According to the information from the Inland Revenue Department, there were 3 780 duly stamped sale and purchase agreements for residential properties valued between $3 million and $4 million from March to May 2025, which represents a significant increase of over 70 per cent as compared to the same period last year (March to May 2024) where 2 183 sale and purchase agreements were duly stamped.

 We will continue to review whether there is room to optimise various relevant arrangements having regard to factors including developments of the property market, the home ownership needs of different citizens, etc."

立法會：房屋局局長動議二讀《簡樸房條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-07-09 15:35,2025-07-09 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900601.htm,"以下是房屋局局長何永賢今日（七月九日）在立法會會議動議二讀《簡樸房條例草案》的發言全文：

主席：

我謹動議二讀《簡樸房條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

香港是一個國際大都會，多年來在社會、經濟、民生發展方面都取得顯著成就。我們期盼香港在繁榮發展的過程中，市民能夠分享當中的成果。但香港過去一段長時間在土地發展過程中受到不同的阻礙，引致房屋供應不足，這個困局導致部分市民被迫居住於環境惡劣的分間單位，俗稱「劏房」，這些苦不堪言的情況是我們不忍心見到的，尤其是老人家、小朋友和身體健康有問題的基層市民。

就此，本屆政府自上任以來採取實際行動，切實地排解民生憂難，推出多項創新、突破的房屋政策，過去三年的努力得以扭轉房屋供應不足的困境，為居於不適切居所的市民提供更多選擇，幫助他們盡快改善生活環境，包括持續「提速、提量、提效、提質」，大幅增加公營房屋，包括出租公屋和資助出售房屋的供應、突破性地推出「簡約公屋」、持續推展過渡性房屋等。這些措施都令輪候公屋的「劏房」戶可更快「上樓」，為解決「劏房」問題提供實際的空間和「底氣」。根據統計處及我們進行的調研，全港有約十一萬個分間單位，其中約七成多的情況並不是大家常常在媒體報道中見到那樣惡劣的，七成多當中很多都有窗、有獨立廁所及大於八平方米；預計只有約三成左右住戶居於較為劣質的「劏房」，這些住戶不僅面對擁擠的生活環境，亦要承受單位內結構安全、消防安全，以及衞生問題等風險。作為負責任的政府，我們積極面對社會這個「痛點」，為全面有序解決劣質「劏房」這個「老大難」問題籌謀對策。

行政長官在二○二三年成立「解決劏房問題」工作組，就全面處理「劏房」問題進行深入調研和提出建議方案。經考慮工作組的報告後，行政長官在去年《施政報告》宣布以立法方式制訂全新的「簡樸房」規管制度，日後住宅分間單位必須符合最低標準，並獲認證為「簡樸房」方可合法出租，以確保分間單位提供合理和安全的居住環境。

房屋局在去年十二月就「簡樸房」規管制度進行了為期約兩個月的持份者諮詢，並分別在去年十二月和今年三月諮詢了立法會房屋事務委員會。立法會議員和持份者普遍認同「簡樸房」規管制度的框架。現時的立法方案已反映了諮詢期間收到的主要意見，包括就政府收取的認證費用提供「早鳥」減免優惠，即早登記早申請的話，費用就可以全免、寬容處理在「簡樸房」登記申請期間被發現遲交分間單位租賃管制下所要求的「租賃通知書」（表格AR2）、放寬登記資格、延長寬限期、放寬窗戶要求，以及增加可進行核證的專業人士範疇等。在此，我衷心感謝各持份者提供貼近民情和合乎現實情況的寶貴意見。

《條例草案》旨在為落實「簡樸房」條例規管制度提供法律依據，訂明住宅樓宇分間單位須符合關於內部面積不少於八平方米，以及樓底淨高度、消防安全、結構安全、照明及通風、廁所、供水點和水電錶，合共八個範疇的居住環境最低標準，並取得「簡樸房」認證，方可合法出租作居住用途。

作為落實「簡樸房」規管制度的過渡安排，《條例草案》會由明年三月一日起生效計，提供48個月的過渡期。這包括由二○二六年三月一日起推展為期12個月的登記制度，讓現存分間單位先進行登記，便可取得由二○二七年三月一日起計為期36個月的寬限期至二○三○年二月二十八日，以逐步進行改造工程和申請「簡樸房」認證。同時，《條例草案》會訂明寬限期屆滿前六個月為倒數期，即二○二九年九月一日至二○三○年二月二十八日，其間禁止已登記但沒有有效認證的分間單位訂立新租賃，以「倒迫」的方法令分間單位的營運者盡快進行改造工程或認證申請，而不是拖延至寬限期的最後一刻。

確立「簡樸房」規管制度，會為市場經營出租分間單位提供清晰的法定標準和要求，新進場的營運者遵從有關標準後便可合法經營，而現有營運者可透過在寬限期內，安排逐步改造糾正，以符合法例要求，使分間單位的供應長遠可以在合理安全的前提下，滿足市場需求。在推行「簡樸房」規管制度的過程中，劣質「劏房」會逐漸被市場淘汰，或在日後的執法行動中被取締。

為達致一定的阻嚇作用，《條例草案》會訂明非法出租的相關罪行，包括：在登記期結束後，即由二○二七年三月一日開始，住宅單位內有兩個或以上的分間單位獨立出租作住宅用途，但沒有有效登記及「簡樸房」認證，相關營運者即屬違法；以及在倒數期期間，即二○二九年九月一日至二○三○年二月二十八日，將已登記但沒有有效「簡樸房」認證的分間單位在倒數期內簽定新租約作住用用途，相關營運者亦屬違法。

視乎違法行為的嚴重程度和個別案情，上述營運者一經定罪，最高可處罰款三十萬元及監禁三年，而刑事責任不會涉及租客。

縱使現存分間單位的質素有非常惡劣的，但也有較優質的，以滿足社會上不同的居住需要。畢竟現時全港有約十一萬住宅樓宇分間單位，涉及約二十二萬名居民，政府會以務實、以民為本的宗旨，並配合未來「簡樸房」及公營房屋的供應，在登記期完結後，即二○二七年三月一日起，有序地對違法出租無登記及無認證的分間單位，採取執法行動。

為確保受影響的分間單位住戶不會流離失所，政府會透過社工隊協助他們尋找其他居所搬遷，亦會靈活調配房屋資源，如過渡性房屋、臨時收容中心、中轉房屋等，為有需要的住戶暫時提供安置。考慮到部分居於分間單位的住戶並不符合公屋申請資格，房屋局最近提出在過渡性房屋新增「丙類租戶」類別，為受「簡樸房」規管條例下的執法行動、改造工程等影響、並且有迫切安置需要，以及通過社工隊小心評估的分間單位住戶，提供短暫居所。然而，我們必須再次清楚強調，即使受影響住戶正輪候傳統公屋，他們不會因執法行動而獲提早編配公屋單位，以免對其他輪候公屋人士造成不公平。

房屋局會全力配合立法會的審議工作，爭取立法會盡快通過《條例草案》，以期二○二六年三月一日推行「簡樸房」規管制度，為告別劣質「劏房」踏出具有重大意義的一步。

要全面告別劣質「劏房」，我們必須要有破釜沉舟的決心。作為「解決劏房問題」工作組的組長及副組長，黃偉綸副司長和我過去多次透過探訪分間單位的住戶、與持份者交流，並持續與政府不同部門理順和協調「簡樸房」規管制度的方案，我們深深體會到劣質「劏房」問題的複雜性和迫切性。在行政長官和財政司副司長的帶領下，加上社會各界普遍支持「簡樸房」規管制度，我相信香港必定能逐步走出劣質「劏房」問題的困境，讓社會上所有人，包括最基層市民，都能在合理、安全的生活環境下活得有尊嚴、有自信，可以好好地和他們的家人一起在社會上籌劃更美好的未來。

我謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"
立法會九題：規管醫療器械,2025-07-09 15:30,2025-07-09 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900329.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林哲玄議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

目前本港僅設自願性的「醫療器械行政管理制度」（該制度），並未立法規管。另一方面，據悉有商戶在網上宣傳及推銷平行進口隱形眼鏡，但該等產品的包裝盒上沒有醫療儀器標籤，或標籤有改動痕跡（例如「唯一識別標籤」被剪去或遮蓋），以致難以辨認產品是否屬有問題批次，品質無從保證。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於在該制度下隱形眼鏡屬第II級醫療器械，政府就隱形眼鏡產品所實施的進口及銷售（包括網上銷售）管制為何；

（二）過去三年政府接獲有關平行進口隱形眼鏡的舉報及求助數目，以及該等個案的分類（例如包裝標籤不當、用後感到不適等）為何；有否對擅自改動隱形眼鏡（包括平行進口隱形眼鏡）包裝資訊的商人採取執法行動；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於政府於去年六月表示，正全面檢討醫療器械的擬議立法架構，政府會否就規管醫療器械的製造、進口、質量檢定、銷售和售後跟進之修例工作訂立明確時間表；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就林哲玄議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局、香港海關和衞生署後，醫務衞生局現綜合回覆如下：

香港現時尚未訂立專門法例規管醫療器械，惟視乎有關產品的特性和特點，一些產品已受現行法例規管，如《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章）、《消費品安全條例》（第456章）及《商品說明條例》（第362章）等。

為保障公眾健康，衞生署自二○○四年起參考全球協調醫療器械規管專責小組（現為國際醫療器械監管機構論壇）的建議，設立自願性的「醫療器械行政管理制度」（「管理制度」），推行醫療器械及貿易商的表列制度，以及產品推出市場後的監察系統。

按照現時的「管理制度」，隱形眼鏡通常獲分類為第II級（中低風險）的一般醫療器械；如需在「管理制度」下表列，須獲證明能符合國際間採納的「醫療器械安全和性能基本原則」要求。至於貿易商（包括本地負責人、本地製造商、進口商及分銷商）的表列制度方面，貿易商亦須符合相關要求，包括持有有效商業登記證、維持供應醫療器械的品質管制系統，以至遵從產品推出市面後的管制，為醫療器械的安全負上責任。除此以外，「管理制度」設有呈報系統，專責處理與已表列醫療器械相關的事件報告，以期及早發現安全警號，提高對使用者的保障。

另一方面，香港海關負責執行《消費品安全條例》及《商品說明條例》。在香港供應予私人使用的消費品，如不受其他法例規管，其產品安全受《消費品安全條例》及其附屬法例《消費品安全規例》規管，包括提問所述的隱形眼鏡。

《消費品安全條例》規定製造商、進口商及供應商須確保其供應的消費品合乎合理的安全程度；而《消費品安全規例》規定就消費品的包裝或標籤上的警示或警告，須以中文及英文表達，並且必須清楚可讀。至於《商品說明條例》涵蓋貨品及服務，禁止商戶對消費者作出某些不良營商手法，包括虛假商品說明、誤導性遺漏、具威嚇性的營業行為、餌誘式廣告宣傳、先誘後轉銷售行為及不當地接受付款，對實體及網上商戶的營業行為同樣適用。

由二○二二年至二○二四年，香港海關並無接獲隱形眼鏡產品安全的投訴，惟接獲六宗涉嫌違反《商品說明條例》的投訴。經調查後，五宗投訴因證據不足而予以結案，餘下一宗個案仍在調查中。

展望將來，衞生署已公布於二○二六年年底成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」，而規管醫療器械將納入其工作範疇。政府現正全力推進相關立法準備工作，因應近年國際間規管醫療器械的最新趨勢，全面檢討擬議立法架構，預計明年向立法會提交立法建議，配合中心的成立時間表。一經立法，日後所有在港供應的醫療器械，如非獲豁免均須註冊，以確保符合安全、品質和性能的相關標準。"
LCQ9: Regulation of medical devices,2025-07-09 15:30,2025-07-09 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900330.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon David Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

  At present, Hong Kong has only put in place a voluntary Medical Device Administrative Control System (the System), and there is no legislation to regulate such devices. On the other hand, it is learnt that some merchants are promoting and marketing parallel-imported contact lenses on the Internet, but these products do not have any medical device labelling on their packaging boxes, or the labelling shows signs of alteration (e.g. ""the unique device identifier"" has been cut off or covered), thus making it difficult to identify whether the products belong to problematic batches, and the quality of such products cannot be guaranteed. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that contact lenses is a class II medical device under the system, of the Government's control over the importation and sale (including online sale) of contact lens products;

(2) of the number of reports and requests for assistance received by the Government in the past three years in relation to parallel-imported contact lenses, as well as the categories of such cases (e.g. improper packaging labels, discomfort after use, etc.); whether it has taken law enforcement actions against merchants who have made unauthorised alterations to the packaging information of contact lenses (including parallel-imported contact lenses); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as the Government indicated in June last year that it was conducting a comprehensive review of the proposed legislative framework for medical device regulation, whether the Government will draw up a concrete timetable for introducing legislative amendments to regulate the manufacture, importation, quality assurance, sale and post-sale follow-up of medical devices; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) and the Department of Health (DH), the Health Bureau provides a consolidated reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon David Lam as follows:

  While there is not yet specific legislation to regulate medical devices in Hong Kong, some products are already regulated by existing pieces of legislation, such as the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance (CGSO) (Cap. 456) and the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO) (Cap. 362) etc., depending on the characteristics and features of the products concerned.

  To safeguard public health, the DH has made reference to the recommendation of the Global Harmonization Task Force (now known as the International Medical Device Regulators Forum) and introduced the voluntary Medical Device Administrative Control System (MDACS) since 2004, under which a listing system for medical devices and traders as well as a post-market monitoring system for the products are put in place. 

  According to the prevailing MDACS, contact lenses are usually categorised as Class II (low-moderate risk) general medical devices. To apply for listing under the MDACS, a medical device must be proven to have met the requirements under the Essential Principles of Safety and Performance of Medical Devices that are adopted internationally. As for the listing system for traders (including local responsible person, local manufacturers, importers and distributors), traders must meet relevant requirements including holding a valid business registration certificate, maintaining a quality management system for supply of medical devices, and complying with post-market control for the products in order to hold them accountable for the safety of medical devices. Besides, a dedicated reporting system has been set up under the MDACS to handle the reporting of incidents pertaining to listed medical devices, with a view to enhancing protection for users via early detection of safety alerts.

  On the other hand, the C&ED is responsible for enforcing the CGSO and the TDO. The safety of consumer goods which are supplied for private use in Hong Kong, if not covered by other legislation, is subject to the regulation of the CGSO and its subsidiary legislation namely the Consumer Goods Safety Regulation (CGSR). This covers contact lenses as mentioned in the question.

  Pursuant to the CGSO, manufacturers, importers and suppliers should ensure that the consumer goods they supply are reasonably safe. The CGSR stipulates that any warning or caution marked on the package of consumer goods must be in both the English and the Chinese languages in a legible and conspicuous manner. Covering both goods and services, the TDO prohibits specified unfair trade practices deployed by traders against consumers, including false trade descriptions, misleading omissions, aggressive commercial practices, bait advertising, bait-and-switch and wrongly accepting payment, which are applicable to the commercial practices of both physical and online traders.

  From 2022 to 2024, the C&ED did not receive any complaint on the product safety of contact lenses, but received six complaints of suspected contravention of the TDO. Upon investigation, five cases were closed due to insufficient evidence, with the remaining one under investigation.

  Looking ahead, the DH has announced the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) by the end of 2026, with regulation of medical devices as part of its purview. The Government is taking forward preparatory work for the relevant legislation at full steam having regard to the latest international trends in regulation of medical devices in recent years, and will comprehensively review the proposed legislative framework. It is expected that the legislative proposal could be submitted to the Legislative Council within the next year so as to dovetail with the timetable for establishing the CMPR. Upon legislation, all medical devices supplied in Hong Kong, unless otherwise exempted, must be registered, thereby ensuring the compliance with relevant standards in safety, quality and performance."
政務司副司長出席「IMPACTable」同桌同餐　星展隨行軟餐品嚐午宴致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-07-09 15:29,2025-07-09 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900376.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（七月九日）出席「IMPACTable」同桌同餐星展隨行軟餐品嚐午宴的致辭：

王首毅總領事（新加坡駐香港總領事王首毅）、陳文宜行政總裁（香港社會服務聯會行政總裁）、陳依依董事總經理（星展銀行（香港）董事總經理兼集團推廣策略及傳訊部主管）、鍾凌峰營運總監（稻香集團營運總監）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位老友記：

  大家好！今天很高興出席星展基金會「IMPACTable」軟餐試食活動。感謝星展基金會、在座的業界領袖及所有參加者，以實際行動讓更多朋友認識軟餐食品，為市場創造銀髮商機。

銀髮經濟涵蓋的層面非常廣泛，包括衣食住行、健康護理、休閒娛樂、金融服務等。面對人口結構轉變的新形勢，我們必須積極應對，並在挑戰中抓緊發展機遇。此所以行政長官在二○二四年《施政報告》提出成立促進銀髮經濟工作組（工作組），由我出任組長。

根據政府統計處的統計調查數據並按通脹調整，二○二四年60歲或以上長者的估算每月消費開支，除住屋開支外，食品開支佔最大部分，達26%（約3,100元），可見銀髮飲食市場的潛力龐大。為此，工作組於五月底就五大範疇公布的30項措施中，多項正正與推動銀髮友善飲食有關，包括：推出「老友記‧食好啲」活動，帶動飲食業界提供適合長者的餐膳體驗和飲食優惠；商經局（商務及經濟發展局）亦聯同香港社會服務聯會（社聯）支援商界推廣「照護食」的標準；以及推動食品製造業界提供迎合長者需要及喜好的預先包裝食品等。其中，應商經局邀請，工商組織於上個月舉行「銀髮經濟研討會」，來自不同領域的專家與業界分享銀髮市場潛力及實踐經驗，鼓勵食品製造商創造更多銀髮友善食品，促進行業的整體發展。

工作組自成立以來已開展推動軟食的工作，例如在「照護食」方面，去年十一月，我見證由社聯和香港中華廠商聯合會簽署「照護食灣區標準」合作備忘錄，助力業界研發更多不同口味的「照護食」。我很高興知道今年內應該可將「照護食」正式納入「灣區標準」清單，成為第一個由香港業界提出及制定的銀髮經濟領域「灣區標準」。

我亦樂見在工作組的帶領和推動下，商界因應銀髮一族的需要相繼推出長者友善餐飲和優惠，並與不同機構合作，籌備一連串推廣活動，將軟餐的概念在社區廣泛宣傳。今日的活動便是一個非常好例子。

我很支持星展基金會資助The Project Futurus成立「同桌同餐吞嚥友善餐廳計劃」，致力發展及推廣咀嚼及吞嚥友善的飲食文化，協助志同道合的餐廳添置製作軟餐的設備、提供專業培訓，甚至共同設計及改良餐單。

我亦感謝稻香集團參與計劃，於旗下四間鍾菜館推出「同桌同餐吞嚥友善饗宴」，涵蓋九道色、香、味俱全的經典中式美饌 ，為有咀嚼及吞嚥困難人士提供安全且優質的精緻用餐選擇。我知道鍾菜館更安排「同桌同餐大使」駐場，協助顧客點選菜單，銀色產品和服務都做足100分。

各位，銀髮經濟市場龐大，消費群體不只本地的老友記，更包括海內外的年長旅客。發展銀髮經濟不僅關乎長者的福祉，更有利商界拓展銷售，推動社會的可持續發展。我們需要社會各界積極協作與行動，才能實現銀髮經濟的最大效應。我期待各界陸續推出各項惠及銀髮一族的措施，把握銀髮經濟帶來的機遇，共同努力提升銀髮的生活質量及推動本港經濟發展。

最後，祝大家用餐愉快，每一口美食都為你帶來健康和滿足。多謝大家。"
立法會五題：法律科技及人工智能的應用,2025-07-09 15:25,2025-07-09 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900441.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳曼琪議員的提問和署理律政司司長張國鈞博士的答覆：

問題：

據悉律政司一直積極推動法律界提升對法律科技，以及人工智能（AI）的應用。有意見認為政府應積極研發於普通法領域應用AI工具（例如由香港生成式人工智能研發中心所研發的大語言模型），以提高法律界的運作效率及競爭力。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）目前有否研發應用於普通法領域的大語言模型；如有，具體詳情及推展時間表為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）有否計劃定期與內地舉辦法律科技及AI高峰論壇或國際展覽，以促進內地與香港在法律科技上的交流合作；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；有否計劃引進內地的法律科技將之應用於香港普通法領域，並助力內地在法律方面的AI服務產品拓展至香港及海外；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）有何措施確保香港中小型律師事務所能受惠於法律科技及AI的發展，例如提供技術支援、設立「法律科技設備」免稅額，以及資助其購置法律科技相關設備？

答覆：

主席：

（一）由香港科技大學牽頭的跨校合作研究中心──香港生成式人工智能研發中心（HKGAI）已開發了香港首個基於DeepSeek模型進行全參數微調的本地人工智能大語言模型「HKGAI V1」。HKGAI基於該本地大語言模型開發了多個適用於不同公務領域的垂直應用，包括生成式人工智能文書輔助應用程式「港文通」，以及與法律相關的「港法通」。律政司現正參與「港文通」的試用計劃，並會在檢討成效之後積極考慮參與「港法通」的試用。與此同時，香港中文大學法律學院最近亦與人工智能軟件公司合作，在粵語大模型的基礎上共同開發法律資訊AI模型，推動法律制度和行業的數碼化轉型。而香港理工大學孵化企業智法數科（WiseLaw Digital Technology）最近亦發布了其人工智能賦能法律產學研創新成果。律政司將根據試用成果、市場科技發展、法律業界及社會需求，以及相關資源配置等因素，與HKGAI及其他相關政府部門或機構展開合作，致力研究及推動人工智能在法律領域的進一步應用，尤其是與香港法律相關的大型語言模型。

（二）律政司十分重視法律科技及人工智能領域的發展，並認為舉辦相關論壇或展覽是促進交流合作的重要平台。目前，律政司正積極籌備相關活動，目標是今年內舉辦首個大型活動，面向全球海內外的參與者，打造一個多元開放的交流平台，促進各地智慧與經驗的共享。

目前，我們留意到內地有不少法律科技企業發展成熟。由於內地法律科技現時主要針對內地法律體系設計，未必能簡單直接地引入香港的普通法市場。然而，我們非常鼓勵內地法律科技企業落戶香港開拓本地法律市場，開發提供適合香港普通法市場的AI產品，並利用香港作為跳板開拓海外其他普通法地區的市場。

（三）為推動法律科技的發展，律政司於二○二五年一月正式成立推動法律科技發展諮詢小組（諮詢小組），邀請業界及各方持份者共同研究和制訂有關法律科技的政策措施。諮詢小組成員涵蓋法律及爭議解決業界、法律學院及法律科技業界等，當中亦有中小型律師事務所的代表，確保政策能符合業界的需要。

諮詢小組特別關注到中小型律師事務所在推動法律科技應用上的挑戰。除經濟因素外，我們理解中小型律師事務所普遍對法律科技的認識不足，且傳統執業模式較少依賴科技，影響了他們採用新技術的意願。

針對此情況，律政司接納了諮詢小組的建議，計劃分三階段，循序漸進推動法律界應用科技：

（1）第一階段：法律科技的認識和教育

推動法律科技政策的首個階段目標是要提高法律業界對法律科技的認識，並了解應用法律科技可為業界帶來的好處及應具備的風險管理意識，藉以改變業內一些固有思維模式及習慣。為此，律政司現正舉辦一系列與法律科技相關的圓桌會議和活動，以提高業界對法律科技的認識，並促進法律業界和法律科技專家交流和分享，令業界能夠規劃可行的法律科技應用方案。

律政司也意識到讓法律學生瞭解法律科技的重要性，會透過法律教育及培訓常設委員會的平台，與法律教育及培訓工作的持份者研究在法律教育課程內加強有關法律科技的培訓。律政司亦計劃起草及發布路線圖，以協助法律業界開展法律科技應用之路；律政司亦計劃發布道德及安全指引，讓法律業界在使用法律科技時遵循。

（2）第二階段：推動業界認識法律科技產品

律政司有意籌劃舉辦法律科技產品博覽，讓法律業界接觸和體驗市場上不同的法律科技產品，找出適合其業務發展的法律科技解決方案。

此外，我們亦正考慮進行市場調查，為法律業界統整在市場上提供的法律科技產品清單，為法律業界提供較為全面的資訊作參考。

（3）第三階段：推動業界使用法律科技

律政司會鼓勵本地及海內外法律科技企業在本地巿場發展，建立香港的法律科技生態系統。律政司將審視上述策略的成效，並在適當時間以政策措施推動業界使用法律科技，並會不時檢討現行法律制度，以更好地支持和規管創新和新興法律科技的發展。

透過上述策略，我們希望能有效提升法律業界對法律科技的認識和應用，從而提升工作效率和專業服務質素，鞏固香港作為亞太區國際法律服務及爭議解決中心的地位。

多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Application of legal technology and artificial intelligence,2025-07-09 15:25,2025-07-09 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900443.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Maggie Chan and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 It is learnt that the Department of Justice has been actively promoting the application of legal technology (lawtech) and artificial intelligence (AI) in the legal sector. There are views that the Government should actively develop AI tools (e.g. large language model developed by the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center) for application in areas of the common law, so as to enhance the operational efficiency and competitiveness of the legal sector. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has currently developed large language models for application in areas of the common law; if so, of the specific details and the implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has plans to organise lawtech and AI summits or international exhibitions with the Mainland on a regular basis, so as to promote exchanges and co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong in lawtech; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; whether it has plans to introduce lawtech from the Mainland and apply it in areas of Hong Kong common law, as well as promote the Mainland's AI legal service products to Hong Kong and overseas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the measures in place to ensure that small and medium-sized law firms in Hong Kong can benefit from the development of lawtech and AI, such as providing technical support, introducing a tax allowance for ""lawtech equipment"" and subsidising their procurement of lawtech-related equipment?

Reply:

President,

(1) The Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Center (HKGAI), an inter-school co-operative research centre led by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, has developed the first local large language model (LLM) based on DeepSeek technology with full parameter fine-tuning – ""HKGAI V1"". The HKGAI has developed multiple vertical applications for various public service sectors based on this local LLM, including the generative artificial intelligence (AI) document assistance application ""HKPilot"" and the legal-related ""LexiHK"". The Department of Justice (DoJ) is currently participating in the pilot use of ""HKPilot"" and is considering participating in the trial of ""LexiHK"" after reviewing its effectiveness. At the same time, the Faculty of Law of the Chinese University of Hong Kong has recently collaborated with an AI software company to develop a legal information AI model based on the Cantonese LLM to facilitate the digital transformation of the legal system and industry. WiseLaw Digital Technology, a company incubated by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, has also recently announced its innovation achievement in legal AI products. The DoJ will collaborate with the HKGAI and other relevant government departments or institutions based on the trial results, market technology development, the needs of the legal sector and the community, and related resource considerations to examine and promote the further application of AI in the legal sector, especially LLMs related to Hong Kong law.

(2) The DoJ attaches great importance on the development of areas of lawtech and AI, and believes that forums and exhibitions provides an important platform for fostering exchange and co-operation. Currently, the DoJ is actively preparing related activities, aiming to hold the first large-scale activity open to global participants, creating a diverse and open exchange platform to promote the sharing of wisdom and experience from various regions.

 We note that there are currently a number of well-developed lawtech enterprises in Mainland China. Since Mainland lawtech is now primarily designed for the Mainland legal system, it may not be directly applicable to Hong Kong's common law market. However, we strongly encourage Mainland lawtech enterprises to set up in Hong Kong to explore the local legal market, develop AI products suitable for the Hong Kong common law market, and use Hong Kong as a springboard to develop markets in other common law jurisdictions overseas.

(3) To promote the development of lawtech, the DoJ established the Consultation Group on Lawtech Development (Consultation Group) in January 2025, and invited the industry and various stakeholders to jointly study and formulate policy measures related to lawtech. The Consultation Group members include representatives from the legal and dispute resolution sectors, law schools, and the lawtech industry, including representatives from small and medium-sized law firms, ensuring that the policies will suit the needs of practitioners.

 The Consultation Group notes in particular the challenges faced by small and medium-sized law firms in promoting the use of lawtech. In addition to economic factors, we understand that small and medium-sized law firms often have limited understanding of lawtech, and traditional practice models tend to rely less on technology, which affects their willingness to adopt new technologies.

 In response to this situation, the DoJ has accepted the suggestion of the Consultation Group and plans to promote the use of technology in the legal industry progressively in three stages:

(1) Phase 1: Lawtech awareness and education

 The aim of the first stage of the policy on promoting lawtech is to change certain ingrained mindsets and practices within the legal profession by raising their awareness of lawtech, and helping them to understand the benefits of the use of lawtech that can bring to the profession and the risk management awareness that the profession should have. To this end, the DoJ is organising a series of lawtech-related roundtables and events to raise the profession's understanding of lawtech and to facilitate the exchange and sharing of information between the profession and lawtech experts to enable them to plan for viable adoption of lawtech.

 The DoJ is also aware of the importance of educating law students about lawtech, and will work with stakeholders in legal education and training to strengthen training related to lawtech in legal education curricula through the Standing Committee on Legal Education and Training platform. The DoJ plans to draft and publish a roadmap to assist the legal profession in embarking on their path to technology applications. The DoJ also plans to issue ethical and security guidelines for the legal profession to follow when using lawtech.

(2) Phase 2: Promoting the profession's engagement with lawtech products

 The DoJ intends to organise an exhibition of lawtech products to enable the legal profession to access and experience a variety of lawtech products available in the market and to identify lawtech solutions suitable for their business development.

 In addition, we are considering conducting a market survey to consolidate a list of lawtech products available in the market in order to provide more comprehensive information to the legal sector for reference.

(3) Phase 3: Promoting the use of lawtech in the legal profession

 The DoJ will encourage local and overseas lawtech enterprises to establish and grow in the local market, thereby fostering Hong Kong's lawtech ecosystem. The DoJ will review the effectiveness of the above strategies and take policy measures to promote the use of lawtech in the legal profession as appropriate. The DoJ will also review the existing legal framework from time to time in order to better support and regulate the development of innovative and emerging legal technologies.

 Through these strategies, we hope to effectively enhance the awareness and use of lawtech by the legal profession, thereby enhancing the efficiency and quality of professional services and strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal services and dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region.

 Thank you, President."

主席：

我動議二讀《2025年立法會（權力及特權）（修訂）條例草案》。

因應立法會完善立法會議員履職制度和引入《立法會議員守則》（《守則》），立法會建議修訂《立法會（權力及特權）條例》（《條例》），對因違反《守則》而根據《議事規則》被暫停職務的立法會議員施加財政處分。

立法會議事規則委員會和內務委員會已通過支持制定《守則》，進一步完善立法會議員的履職制度，包括清楚訂明對立法會議員行為操守和履職的要求、改善立法會議員利益申報機制，以及就立法會議員各類不當行為設立處分機制。當中，立法會建議向違反《守則》並查明屬實的議員施加不同程度的處分，包括涉事議員可以被暫停立法會職務，並且在停職期間不會獲發議員酬金及津貼。

根據現行《條例》，只有在議員作出極不檢點行為而被暫停職務的情況下，其停職期間的酬金及津貼才會被扣起。為落實立法會的建議，特區政府應立法會要求提交本《條例草案》，擴大財政處分的適用範圍，涵蓋議員因其他違反《守則》行為而被暫停職務的情況。修訂同時賦予立法會彈性，容許日後根據《議事規則》批准的其他理由，扣起被暫停職務議員的酬金及津貼。

政府樂見立法會以更高的標準加強自我監督和自我完善，並提升運作透明度。立法會引入《守則》，符合社會對立法會議員的期望。

如果議員支持及早日通過《條例草案》，有關的修訂建議就能在第八屆立法會任期開始當日生效，配合立法會完善議員的履職制度，為下一屆立法會能繼續貫徹「愛國者治港」原則、更好發揮立法會的憲制職能奠定良好的基礎。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

Government revises traffic-related fees and fixed penalties,2025-07-09 15:15,2025-07-09 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900404.htm,"The Government announced today (July 9) a proposal to adjust four traffic-related fees, including tunnel tolls, licence fees for electric private cars, the maximum fee level of parking meters, and fixed penalties for traffic offences.

The spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The 2025-26 Budget announced that the Government would focus on reviewing traffic charges and fixed penalties that have not been adjusted for many years. Our overall considerations are to enhance traffic management and maintain public fiscal discipline, reflecting the principles of 'cost recovery' and 'user pays'.""

To this end, the Government has formulated a total of four legislative amendments:

(1) Road Tunnels (Government) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025 - Adjustment of tunnel tolls

Adopting a science-based approach, the Government has reviewed the tolls for government tunnels and major roads, in the order of priority, adhering to four charging principles: traffic management needs, efficiency first, public transport first, and ""user-pays"". After comprehensively considering these four principles and the specific circumstances of each tunnel and major road, it has been decided to propose increasing the tolls for the Aberdeen Tunnel and Shing Mun Tunnels, and to introduce a toll for the use of the Central Kowloon Bypass. The new tolls for the Aberdeen Tunnel and Shing Mun Tunnels will be effective on September 21, 2025, while toll collection for the Central Kowloon Bypass will commence when it is fully commissioned in 2026. The toll scheme is summarised as follows:





Current toll
			(Fixed toll for all vehicles throughout the day)
Proposed toll
			(Fixed toll for all vehicles throughout the day)


Aberdeen Tunnel
$5
$8


Shing Mun Tunnels
$5
$8


Central Kowloon Bypass
			(Yau Ma Tei Section Tunnel)
/
$8




The spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The tolls for the Aberdeen Tunnel and Shing Mun Tunnels have not been adjusted for 34 years, during which time inflation has exceeded 130 per cent, resulting in operational deficits. The $8 toll is expected to have a minimal impact on traffic, and the adjusted tolls will enable the tunnels to achieve break-even in operations. On the other hand, the Central Kowloon Bypass will alleviate the current traffic congestion on major trunk roads in Kowloon, offering a shorter route with higher speeds, making it highly attractive to drivers. If no toll is charged for the use of the Central Kowloon Bypass, it is expected that its utilisation rate will approach a saturation point shortly after its commissioning. Taking into account the views of the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport (TP) and the community, and in order to attract more motorists to use the bypass and hence achieve an effective traffic diversion, the Government is proposing an $8 toll. The proposed toll level will effectively divert approximately 20 per cent of the overall traffic from saturated major roads in Kowloon, while reserving about 15 per cent of spare capacity of theCentral Kowloon Bypass to accommodate future traffic growth. It will also recover nearly 80 per cent of basic operational costs; and according to the efficiency-first principle, the fees payable by commercial and public transport vehicles will be consistent with the moderate toll charged for smaller private cars.""

The spokesperson continued, ""We have also reviewed other government tunnels and trunk roads in accordance with the four major principles. In summary, taking into account the traffic management needs and traffic flow of other government tunnels and trunk roads, the traffic flow of alternative routes, as well as future transport infrastructure projects related to each route, such as the commissioning of new alternative routes, we recommend maintaining the current tolling arrangements for the time being and reviewing them again at an appropriate time.""

(2) Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulation 2025 - Rationalising the licence fee structure and levels for electric private cars

The existing licence fees for electric private cars are charged by vehicle unladen weight, and the licence fees for fuel-propelled private cars are about six times more than that for electric private cars. The Government proposes to revise the annual licence fee structure for electric private cars by charging licence fees based on their rated power. A five-tier licence fee structure for electric private cars based on their rated power will be introduced, and the fee levels will be suitably adjusted, which would take five phases over six years to complete, to align with technological advancements and practices in other regions. The new licence fee structure will take effect from November 1, 2025, and will apply to newly registered electric private cars, while existing electric private cars will be granted a four-month grace period. Details are as follows:

# Exclusive of the Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Fund levy (at $114 per vehicle annually).
			* The fee for a licence for four months is 35 per cent of that for an annual licence, plus an additional fee of $30.




Licence fee concessions will be offered to eligible disabled electric private car owners (see note).

The spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""Taking into account the views of the LegCo TP, the adjustment of electric private cars licence fees will be implemented in five phases to provide the public with a longer adaptation period. Upon adjustments, the new annual licence fee levels for electric private cars will still be 25 per cent (fifth tier) to 40 per cent (first tier) lower than the current licence fees for fuel-propelled vehicles, to continue encouraging motorists to switch to electric vehicles and promote environmental protection. According to the current type distribution of licensed electric private cars, 99 per cent of the vehicles fall within the first, second and third tiers, while the proportions of vehicles in the fourth and fifth tiers are only 1 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. As electric vehicles become increasingly popular, with a wider range of brands and models available on the market, and given that electric vehicles have lower energy, repair and maintenance costs compared to fuel-propelled vehicles, we expect that electric vehicles will remain appealing to motorists even after the rationalisation of annual licence fee structure and levels.""

(3) Road Traffic (Parking) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 - Adjustment of parking meter charges

To optimise the use of limited parking resources, the Government proposes to increase the maximum fee for metered parking from $2 per 15 minutes to $4 per 15 minutes, viz. a maximum fee of $16 per hour to increase the turnover of vehicles using metered parking spaces to meet the short-term parking needs of motorists. The new charges for metered parking spaces will take effect from September 28, 2025. The fees for metered parking spaces for goods vehicles, buses and coaches will be maintained at the existing level.

(4) Proposed Motion for Resolutions under the Fixed Penalty (Traffic Contraventions) Ordinance (Cap. 237) and the Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance (Cap. 240) - Adjustment of fixed penalties for traffic offences

To enhance traffic safety and ensure a smooth traffic flow, the Government proposes to increase the fixed penalty for illegal parking from the current $320 to $400 (a 25 per cent increase). The fixed penalties for 19 other traffic offences related to road safety and traffic congestion (details in the Annex) will be increased from the current range of $320 to $1,000 to a new range of $480 to $1,500 (a 50 per cent increase). The penalty amounts for other traffic offences will remain unchanged.

The spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The fixed penalty levels for illegal parking and most of the traffic contraventions have remained unchanged for 31 years, and their deterrent effect may have been offset by inflation during this period. In fact, the fixed penalty levels of traffic contraventions in Hong Kong are much lower than those of various overseas regions. We have observed that the numbers of certain traffic offences continue to trend upwards or remain at a persistently high level. Adjusting the penalty amounts for these traffic offences will help enhance the deterrent effect, thereby safeguarding traffic safety and maintaining smooth traffic flow. At the same time, the Government will strive to increase the supply of parking spaces to meet parking demand as far as possible.""

The Road Tunnels (Government) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025, the Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulation 2025, and the Road Traffic (Parking) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 will be gazetted on July 18 and tabled at the LegCo on July 23 for negative vetting. As for the penalties for traffic violations under the Schedules to the Fixed Penalty (Traffic Contraventions) Ordinance (Cap. 237) and the Fixed Penalty (Criminal Proceedings) Ordinance (Cap. 240), the LegCo may amend them by resolution under positive vetting. The Secretary for Transport and Logistics will move a motion at the LegCo meeting on July 30 to pass the resolutions. The regulatory details and effective dates are specified in respective amendment regulations and the proposed resolutions, and relevant information is set out in the LegCo brief issued by the Government today.

Note:No licence fee shall be payable where the rated power of an electric private car owned by an eligible disabled person does not exceed 75 kilowatts. Where the rated power of the electric private car exceeds 75 kilowatts, the annual licence fee payable shall be calculated by the deduction from the prescribed annual licence fee payable in respect of its rated power which does not exceed 75 kilowatts."

LCQ1: Obesity in the population,2025-07-09 14:45,2025-07-09 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900418.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Kin-por and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

  In 2018, the Government launched the ""Towards 2025: Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Control Non-communicable Diseases in Hong Kong"", setting out the targets for preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases to be achieved by 2025, which include ""halting the rise in diabetes and obesity"". However, according to the Department of Health's ""Report of Population Health Survey 2020-2022"", 22 per cent of the people in Hong Kong aged 15 to 84 are overweight and 32.6 per centare obese, which is an increase as compared with the 2014-2015 data, indicating that obesity is on the rise. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the latest data relating to the obese population available to the Government, and the gap between such data and the target set in 2018; the frequency of surveys on the obese population in Hong Kong conducted by the Department of Health and the timing of the next survey;

(2) of the measures taken by the Government to halt the rise in obesity; whether it has reviewed the effectiveness of such measures and the reasons for their failure to effectively halt the rise in obesity; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) the National Health Commission launched a three-year ""Weight Management Year"" initiative last year, aiming to reduce the average annual increase in obesity rate by 10 per cent, of the measures put in place by the Government to tie in with the relevant policy?

Reply:

President,

  Obesity is a global problem. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the global prevalence of obesity has increased by more than doubled from 1990 to 2022, and the situation worsened during the COVID-19 epidemic. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has all along been closely monitoring the obesity problem and launched the ""Towards 2025: Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent and Control Non-communicable Diseases in Hong Kong"" (SAP) in 2018 with a focus on non-communicable diseases (including obesity) and their common behavioural risk factors (such as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity), to comprehensively promote a healthy lifestyle.

  In consultation with relevant bureaux and departments, my reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Kin-por is as follows:

(1) The SAP has made reference to the WHO's ""Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 2013-2020"", and one of the objectives is to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity among individuals aged 18 to 84, viz. ensuring that by 2025 or earlier, the prevalence rates do not increase compared to 2014-15.

  The Department of Health (DH) conducts Population Health Survey (PHS) approximately every five years with Health Behaviour Survey (HBS) conducted in between as regular surveillance. The figures quoted by the Hon Chan Kin-por are from the latest PHS (i.e. conducted in 2020-22). The prevalence of overweight and obesity among people aged between 18 and 84 at that time was 51.3 per cent, which was higher than 47 per cent in 2014/15 (Note). However, that was during COVID-19 epidemic where there were significant changes in the living habits of our citizens, including lack of physical activities and having some unhealthy eating habits. The 2025/26 PHS is expected to be commenced in the third quarter this year with the findings expected to be available in end-2026. The Government will review the objectives and effectiveness of the SAP by referencing the relevant data.

  In fact, we have noticed significant improvements in related situations post-COVID-19 epidemic, for example:

(i) The PHS 2020-22 showed that 24.8 per cent of individuals aged 18 or above performed an insufficient level of physical activity and that was during the COVID-19 epidemic, The relevant figure has already improved in the HBS 2023 to 14.8 per cent.

(ii) Data from the Student Health Service of the DH also showed that the problem of obesity and overweight among primary and secondary students showed significant improvement after the epidemic, with prevalence decreased from 21.2 per cent in the 2021/22school year to 17.9 per cent in the 2023/24 school year, which was the lowest since the 2010/11 school year. Relevant statistics are at Annex.

(2) The fundamental cause of obesity is the amount of calories consumed from food and drinks exceeds the amount of calories expended in normal body functions and daily activities. Leading a healthy lifestyle, including managing diet and increase physical activities, is the key to reducing the risk of obesity. The DH has adopted a life-course and settings-based approach and implemented population-wide intervention measures and programmes, for example:

(i) Under the Whole School Health Programme, health reports are compiled for each participating school to recommend targeted school-based measures to improve physical activities and meals of primary and secondary students. Currently, over 800 schools have participated in the Programme, covering nearly 70 per cent of primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong.

(ii) The ""Joyful@Healthy Workplace"" programme promotes healthy eating, physical activities and mental health to employers and employees. Currently, over 3 400 organisations have participated in the programme, covering more than 820 000 employees.

(iii) The ""EatSmart Restaurant Star+"" campaign encourages restaurants to offer less salt, sugar and oil with more vegetables and fruit dishes to assist citizens in practicing healthy eating. Currently, over 1 300 restaurants have participated in the campaign.

(iv) The ""10 000 Steps a Day"" Campaign raises public awareness of the physical and mental health benefits of walking. Last year, about 10 000 citizens participated in the event we organised together with Shenzhen and Zhuhai.

  As regards primary healthcare, the District Health Centres actively promote the Life Course Preventive Care Plan to establish healthy lifestyle patterns and raise self-health management awareness among citizens of different age groups. The newly established Women Wellness Satellites will also provide weight management health educational activities for women.

  Other bureaux and departments are also committed to creating a favourable environment to encourage citizens to establish healthy lifestyles. Related efforts include:

(i) The Education Bureau launched the ""Active Students, Active People"" Campaign and the ""MVPA60 Award Scheme"" to encourage students to develop the habit of regular physical activity at an early stage.

(ii) The Environment and Ecology Bureau promotes sugar reduction. Its Committee on Reduction of Salt and Sugar in Food collaborates with various departments and the food and beverage industry, including the implementation of the ""Salt/Sugar"" Label Scheme for Prepackaged Food Products to help consumers identify ""low-sugar"" products.

(iii) The Leisure and Cultural Services Department offers diversified recreation and sports programmes to promote ""Sport for All"" culture in the community and at schools. It has been organising the Sport For All Day annually since 2009.

(3) Under the Framework of ""one country, two systems"", the Health Bureau maintains close contact with the National Health Commission (NHC). The aforementioned SAP is also aligned with the national health policy. The Government will continue to enhance public awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle with reference to the WHO's Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases and the multi-faceted weight management guidelines formulated by the NHC, actively collaborate with stakeholders and community partners to create a more health-conducive environment.

  Thank you, President.

Note: Body mass index (BMI) is defined as weight (kilogram) divided by the square of height (metre). Its unit of measurement is kilogram/metre2 (kg/m2). Based on the definition of overweight and obesity for adults adopted in Hong Kong, a BMI from 23 to less than 25 is regarded as overweight, while a BMI of 25 or more is considered obese. Relevant prevalence is age-standardised prevalence."
立法會一題：人口肥胖問題,2025-07-09 14:45,2025-07-09 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900415.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳健波議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

政府於二○一八年推出《邁向2025：香港非傳染病防控策略及行動計劃》，列出須在二○二五年或之前實現的防控非傳染病目標，當中包括「制止糖尿病及肥胖問題上升」。然而根據衞生署的《2020至2022年度人口健康調查報告書》，本港15歲至84歲人士中有百分之二十二屬超重，百分之三十二點六屬肥胖，較二○一四至二○一五年度數據有所增加，顯示肥胖問題有上升趨勢。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）政府最新掌握的肥胖人口相關數據，以及其與二○一八年所訂目標的差距為何；衞生署就本港肥胖人口進行調查的頻率及下次調查時間為何；

（二）政府就制止肥胖問題上升採取了甚麼措施；有否檢視該等措施的成效，以及其未能有效制止肥胖問題上升的原因；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）國家衞生健康委員會去年推動「體重管理年」三年行動，目標把肥胖率年均增幅下降一成，政府有何措施配合有關政策？

答覆：

主席：

肥胖是一個全球性的問題。根據世界衞生組織（世衞）的數據，由一九九○年到二○二二年，全球肥胖流行率增加一倍多，並在新冠疫情期間惡化。香港特別行政區政府一直密切關注肥胖問題，並於二○一八年發表《邁向2025︰香港非傳染病防控策略及行動計劃》（《策略及行動計劃》），重點關注包括肥胖問題等非傳染病和其共通行為風險因素（例如不健康飲食、缺乏體能活動），從而全方位推廣健康生活模式。

就陳健波議員的提問，經諮詢相關政策局及部門後，我現在回覆如下：

（一）《策略及行動計劃》參考了世衞《2013至2020年防控非傳染病全球行動計劃》，其中一個目標是制止18至84歲人士糖尿病及肥胖問題的上升，即與二○一四／二○一五年度比較，二○二五年或之前相關比率無增長。

衞生署大約每五年進行一次人口健康調查，其間亦會進行健康行為調查作恆常監測。陳健波議員所引用數據是最近一次人口健康調查，即二○二○至二二年度進行。當時18至84歲人士的超重及肥胖普遍率為51.3%，高於二○一四／一五年度的47%（註），但當時正值新冠疫情期間，市民的生活模式經歷重大轉變，包括缺少體能活動和有一些不良的飲食習慣。2025/26年度人口健康調查預計將於今年第三季正式開始，並於二○二六年年尾有結果。政府會以有關數據，檢視《策略及行動計劃》的目標及成效。

事實上，我們留意到相關情況在新冠疫後有顯著改善的跡象，例如：

（ｉ）2020-22年度人口健康調查結果顯示24.8%的18歲或以上人士體能活動量不足，當時是新冠疫情期間，而有關數字於二○二三年度健康行為調查已經有所改善，數字為14.8%。

（ｉｉ）衞生署學生健康服務的數據亦顯示，中小學生肥胖及超重的問題在疫後有明顯改善。普遍率由二○二一／二二學年的21.2%下降至二○二三／二四學年17.9%，是自二○一○／一一學年以來的最低。相關數據載於附件。

（二）肥胖問題源於由食物及飲料中攝取的熱量超過正常身體機能和日常活動消耗的熱量。奉行健康生活模式，控制飲食及增加運動是降低肥胖風險的關鍵。衞生署一直以貫穿人生歷程和環境為本的方式，推行全民的介入措施和計劃，例如：

（ｉ）「全校園健康計劃」下編製「一校一健康報告」以針對性校本措施，改善中小學生體能活動和飲食。現時有超過800間學校參與，涵蓋近七成全港中小學。

（ｉｉ）「好心情@健康工作間」計劃向僱主和僱員推廣健康飲食、體能活動及心理健康。現時有超過3 400間機構參與，涵蓋超過82萬名僱員。

（ｉｉｉ）「星級有營食肆」運動，鼓勵食肆提供少鹽、少糖、少油及多蔬果的菜式，並協助市民實踐健康飲食。現時有超過1 300家食肆參與。

（ｉｖ）「日行萬步」活動令更多市民認識步行對身心健康的益處。去年我們與深圳市和珠海市一起舉辦的活動，有約一萬名市民參加。

基層醫療方面，地區康健中心積極推廣「健康人生計劃」，為不同年齡層的市民建立健康生活模式及自我健康管理的意識，而新設立的「樂研站」亦為婦女提供體重管理健康教育。

其他政策局及部門亦致力營造有利環境，推動市民建立健康生活，相關工作包括：

（ｉ）教育局先後開展「躍動校園活力人生」計劃及「MVPA60獎勵計劃」，鼓勵學生盡早建立恆常參與體能活動的習慣。

（ｉｉ）環境及生態局推動減糖，其轄下的降低食物中鹽和糖委員會與不同部門和飲食業界協作，包括推行預先包裝食品標籤計劃（預先包裝食品「鹽╱糖」標籤計劃）以協助消費者辨認「低糖」產品。

（ｉｉｉ）康樂及文化事務署舉辦多元化的康體活動，以在社區和校園推廣「普及體育」的文化，更加自二○○九年起，每年舉辦全民運動日。

（三）在「一國兩制」框架下，醫務衞生局與國家衞生健康委員會（國家衞健委）保持緊密聯繫，上述的《策略及行動計劃》亦配合國家的健康政策。政府會繼續參考世衞的《防控非傳染病全球行動計劃》，以及國家衞健委制訂的多角度體重管理方針，提升公眾有關健康生活重要性的意識，積極與持份者和社區夥伴密切合作，以營造更有利健康的環境。

多謝主席。

註：體重指標的定義為體重（公斤）除以身高（米）的平方。其單位為公斤／平方米（kg/m2）。根據本港成年人超重和肥胖定義，體重指標介乎23至25以下屬超重，而體重指標達25或以上則屬肥胖。有關普遍率為年齡標準化普遍率。"
立法會六題：公共交通工具的非禮案,2025-07-09 14:36,2025-07-09 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900395.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林新強議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的答覆：

問題：

近年公共交通工具不時發生非禮案，引起公眾關注。另一方面，有意見指出在車廂擁擠的情況下，人與人之間的肢體接觸難以避免，或可能被誤會為非禮行為。此外，社會對公共交通工具的安全度、舒適度，以及乘客間互相尊重的期望也不斷提高。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，警方每年接獲多少宗在公共交通工具上發生的非禮案件，以及該數目佔在公共交通工具上發生的案件總數的百分比為何；該等非禮案件中，有多少宗成功定罪；是否知悉法庭審理該等非禮案件平均需時多久；及

（二）會否考慮在各大型公共交通工具（例如港鐵及專營巴士）設立女士或男士專用的區域或車廂；如會，實施時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

​警方非常重視並會全力調查每宗涉及性罪行的案件，特別是發生在公共交通工具上的相關罪行。目前發生在公共交通工具上的性罪行主要為非禮案件，即《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）的猥褻侵犯罪，一經循公訴程序定罪，可處監禁10年。此外，也有發生窺淫及俗稱「影裙底」的非法拍攝或觀察私密部位案件，兩者在《刑事罪行條例》的最高刑罰均為監禁五年。

警方會繼續加強在相關地區的軍裝及便衣巡邏，並與公共運輸機構緊密合作，協力打撃在公共交通工具發生的非禮及相關罪行。警方亦會加強宣傳教育工作，提高市民的警覺性，以及鼓勵市民遇有罪案發生，應挺身舉報。

就議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局後，我現回覆如下：

（一）過去五年，警方接獲有關交通工具／轉乘處／車站發生的性罪行，包括《刑事罪行條例》的猥褻侵犯罪、窺淫及非法拍攝或觀察私密部位罪報案宗數，佔所有在公共交通工具上的案件約7%至21%不等。詳情可參閱附件。就二○二五年首五個月而言，警方共接獲141宗相關報案，佔所有在公共交通工具／轉乘處／車站發生的案件總數約14%。

政府未有就上述性罪行的定罪數字以案發地點作分項統計，亦沒有備存法院審理這類案件所需時間的相關統計數字。

（二）至於會否在各大型公共交通工具（例如港鐵及專營巴士）設立女士或男士專用的區域或車廂，涉及多項考慮因素。本港的公共交通系統每天載客量超過1 100萬人次，其中港鐵和專營巴士是最主要的出行途徑，每日的乘客人次分別超過500萬人次和370萬人次。

港鐵是世界上其中一個服務最頻密的鐵路系統。在二○二四年，重鐵列車及輕鐵共行駛逾271萬班次，繁忙時間列車服務可達約每兩分鐘一班。

港鐵公司有參考一些海外經驗，但經評估後認為不適宜在港鐵網絡設立女士或男士專用車廂。現時繁忙時間，港鐵系統月台（尤其在轉線車站）普遍出現人潮，港鐵公司須善用月台和車廂空間以疏導人流。設置專用車廂會對車站及月台的客流管理，以及列車車廂之間的客流造成影響。此外，港鐵大部分列車車廂屬開放式設計，在運作上難以控制乘客遵循有關安排。因此港鐵公司現階段沒有計劃設置專用車廂。

為防止鐵路非禮罪行，港鐵公司已在車站張貼海報，加強宣傳防止非禮罪行信息，並鼓勵乘客不要啞忍，當遇事或發現有非禮罪案發生時，要挺身而出盡快報警，或通知車站職員。港鐵車站職員已接受適當訓練，以協助警方打擊罪行。此外，港鐵公司與警方亦有定期召開防止罪案會議，交換最新罪案趨勢及情報，商討針對性策略打擊罪案，並會與警方合作舉辦宣傳活動，包括每年定期舉辦的反罪惡宣傳活動，以提高乘客的防罪意識。

至於專營巴士方面，不少路線於繁忙時段均有較高的載客率。由於車廂空間有限，而且乘客須使用車廂內同一通道上落車，在車廂內設置專用區域會影響巴士的載客效率，而且在運作上亦難以控制乘客遵循有關安排。專營巴士公司亦會和警方合作，加強打擊相關罪行。"
LCQ6: Indecent assault cases on public transport,2025-07-09 14:36,2025-07-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900394.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lam San-keung and a reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

In recent years, there have been sporadic cases of indecent assault on public transport which arouse public concern. On the other hand, there are views that physical contact between individuals is difficult to be avoided in crowded vehicle compartments and could be mistaken for indecent assault. Moreover, society's expectations for safety, comfort and mutual respect among passengers on public transport are increasing. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of indecent assault cases occurred on public transport that the Police received in each of the past five years, and the percentage of these cases out of the total number of cases occurring on public transport; the number of convictions among these indecent assault cases; whether it knows the average time taken by the courts to adjudicate these indecent assault cases; and

(2) whether it will consider introducing women-only or men-only zones or compartments on public transport mass-carriers (e.g. the MTR and franchised buses); if so, of the implementation timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Police attach great importance to all cases involving sexual offences and are dedicated to investigating each of them thoroughly, with particular focus on offences taking place on public transport. At present, sexual offences occurred on public transport are mainly indecent assault cases (i.e. offence of indecent assault under the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200)), for which offenders shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for 10 years. There are also cases of voyeurism and unlawful recording or observation of intimate parts (commonly known as ""upskirt photography""), both of which carry a maximum penalty of five years of imprisonment under the Crimes Ordinance.

The Police will continue to strengthen patrols by uniformed and plain-clothes officers in relevant areas, and will work closely with public transport operators to jointly combat indecent assault and its related offences on public transport. In parallel, the Police will step up publicity and education efforts to enhance public awareness and encourage members of the public to report crimes.

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) In the past five years, the number of reports received by the Police on sexual offences occurred on public transport/interchanges/transport stations, including offences of indecent assault, voyeurism and unlawful recording or observation of intimate parts under the Crimes Ordinance, accounted for about seven per cent to 21 per cent of all offences occurred on public transport. Please refer to the Annex for details. For the first five months of 2025, the Police received a total of 141 relevant reports, which accounted for about 14 per cent of the total number of offences occurred on public transport/interchanges/transport stations.

The Government maintains neither a breakdown on the number of convictions of the above sexual offences by place of occurrence nor relevant statistics on the time taken by courts to adjudicate such cases.

(2) As to whether women-only or men-only zones or compartments shall be introduced on various mass public transport modes (such as MTR and franchised buses), a number of considerations are relevant. The public transport system in Hong Kong carries a total patronage of more than 11 million passenger trips daily, with the MTR and franchised buses being the main travelling means handling over 5 million and 3.7 million passenger trips per day respectively.

The MTR is one of the railway systems with the most frequent services in the world. In 2024, the heavy rail and light rail operated over 2.71 million trips, with train services reaching about one train in every two minutes during peak hours.

The MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) has made reference to some overseas experience but assessed that it would not be appropriate to introduce women-only or men-only compartments in the MTR network. At present, during peak hours, the MTR system is generally crowded at platforms (especially at interchange stations), and the MTRCL has to make good use of the space on platform as well as inside train compartment to ease the passenger flow. Introducing dedicated train compartments would affect the management of passenger flow at stations and platforms, as well as the flow of passengers between train compartments. In addition, most of the MTR train compartments are of open design and it is operationally difficult to control passengers to follow the arrangement. Therefore, the MTRCL has no plan at this stage to introduce dedicated train compartments.

To prevent crimes of indecent assaults in the railway premises, the MTRCL has put up posters at stations to step up the promotion of anti-crime messages on indecent assaults. Passengers are encouraged not to remain silent, and report incidents or crimes of indecent assaults immediately to the Police or station staff. The MTR station staff are properly trained to assist the Police in combating crimes. In addition, the MTRCL and the Police hold regular anti-crime meetings to share information about the latest crime trend and intelligence, and to deliberate on specific strategies to combat crimes. The MTRCL also organises publicity activities in collaboration with the Police (including regular anti-crime publicity activities organised annually) so as to raise passengers' anti-crime awareness.

In respect of franchised buses, many routes have high occupancy rates during peak hours. As there is limited space in the compartments and passengers board and alight in the same aisle, setting up dedicated areas inside the compartments will affect the passenger-carrying efficiency of buses. In addition, it will be operationally difficult to ensure that passengers follow the arrangements. Franchised bus companies will co-operate with the police to enhance efforts in combating crimes."

問題：

根據政府於今年六月回覆本會議員質詢時所提供的數據，今年首四個月警方共錄得1 534宗網上投資騙案，涉及騙款金額約10.2億元。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）已針對三種常見的投資騙局展開防騙宣傳教育，政府有否制訂具體措施支持證監會的反詐騙宣傳活動，以提高公眾對投資騙局的警覺性；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）有否計劃加強與證監會的合作，更新和強化投資者教育，以確保投資者能夠有效識別及防範新興的投資風險和不斷演變的詐騙手法和科技；及

（三）針對證監會推出的「咪做水魚」反詐騙宣傳活動，政府有否進一步的策略或投放更多資源，以擴大該活動的影響力，使更多投資者能夠受益並避免成為網上投資騙案的受害者，如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府十分重視投資者教育，一直致力支持證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）及轄下的投資者及理財教育委員會（投委會），透過不同形式和渠道加強公眾的理財能力。就問題的各部分，經諮詢保安局、證監會及香港金融管理局（金管局），我現回覆如下。

（一）及（二）二○二五年首五個月，警方合共錄得1 849宗網上投資騙案，涉及金額約為12.4億元。政府十分重視投資者的保障，持續致力透過宣傳及執法兩大方向打擊網上投資騙案。

宣傳方面，政府聯同證監會及其轄下的投委會，一直致力提升投資者的金融防騙能力，提高大眾對相關金融產品的認知，並提醒投資者注意數碼理財的風險。

投委會於二○二五年三月聯同不同持份者舉辦的「香港理財月」以「反呃防騙理財抗逆」為主題，透過跨媒體宣傳向不同社群分享防騙資訊，全方位推廣防騙訊息。宣傳短片於宣傳期內共錄得2 060萬瀏覽次數。針對日新月異的科技及不斷演變的詐騙手法，投委會亦透過不同的金融防騙教育資訊、動畫短片、網上講座等資源，教育公眾防範投資騙案，包括「唱高散貨」、社交媒體投資群組、欺詐交易應用程式或投資平台、偽冒身分、深度偽造（Deepfake）技術及釣魚短訊等。投委會的網站也設有網上防騙遊戲及反詐騙測試，讓公眾在有趣互動的遊戲中學習防騙知識。

投委會於二○二四年三月推出全港首個數碼體驗模式的「理財教育體驗館」，以沉浸式和互動方式為更多市民提供投資及防騙教育。館內設有多個以防騙為主題的互動遊戲，讓訪客學習辨識和應對各種金融陷阱。截至二○二五年六月底，已有超過26 500人次到訪體驗館，絕大部分訪客表示體驗館提升了他們的防騙知識。

另一方面，金管局聯同銀行推出了名為「智安存」的保護措施，為客戶的銀行存款提供多一重的保護。「智安存」讓客戶可將部分銀行存款分隔，不能經由網上及其他渠道轉出，並在動用受保護的存款時，需要到銀行分行由職員進行額外核實程序。所有零售銀行將於今年年底前全面推出「智安存」服務。

針對網上投資騙案的執法方面，由於現時本港大部分騙案利用傀儡戶口收款，打擊傀儡戶口是打擊詐騙產業鏈的有效方法。二○二五年首五個月，警方就涉及各類型騙案及洗黑錢的罪行共拘捕3 028人，當中約七成被捕人士是傀儡戶口持有人。警方亦自二○二三年年底起，就涉及傀儡戶口的案件向法庭申請引用《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）第27條加重刑罰，以加強阻嚇力。有被定罪的傀儡戶口持有人刑期加幅超過三成。

香港警務處亦於二○二五年四月至五月聯同澳門特別行政區、馬來西亞、馬爾代夫、新加坡、南韓及泰國警方，進行反詐騙跨境合作平台「FRONTIER+」的首次聯合行動，攜手打擊跨境詐騙犯罪活動。行動成功識別並瓦解多個跨境詐騙網絡，共拘捕1 858人，涉及9 268宗包括投資騙案在內的詐騙案。此外，有見網上投資騙案在二○二五年年初有所增加，香港警方在過去數月不時舉辦記者會，並透過不同渠道加強宣傳，提醒市民保持警惕。

（三）證監會在二○二四年十二月新推出了「咪做水魚」反詐騙宣傳活動，以提醒公眾防範常見的欺詐手法。該活動以證監會的原創卡通角色「水魚」為主角，因其個性衝動又輕易信人，故容易成為投資騙局的受害者。

配合證監會聚焦宣傳公眾應提防的三種常見騙局（網戀投資騙局、偽冒名人陷阱，以及投資「教室」詐騙），證監會推出了一首以「水魚」為主角的原創主題曲及音樂短片，推出後約三個月已吸引超過一百萬次觀看次數。截至二○二五年六月底，證監會已在「水魚」的社交平台上發布了約50篇帖文，吸引超過1 500名追蹤者，並獲得超過423 000名獨立用戶瀏覽。

為了進一步透過「水魚」宣傳防騙訊息，證監會已製作以「水魚」為主題的通訊軟件貼圖，以輕鬆幽默的方式傳遞防騙訊息。除了不同的線上和線下廣告，證監會於二○二五年五月至六月透過港鐵站廣告和電視資訊娛樂節目，加強「咪做水魚」反詐騙宣傳活動，估計觀看人次超過160萬。

事實上，政府一直積極提高市民對各類型騙案的認知以防受騙。警方自二○一七年七月成立「反詐騙協調中心」，協調警隊各相關部門的打擊及預防詐騙工作，並推出了「防騙易18222」24小時電話諮詢熱線、主動識別騙案受害人的「騙案預警」計劃等措施。

此外，警方自二○二○年六月起推出防騙吉祥物「提子」，以親民互動的方式解釋騙徒的最新犯案手法及提供簡單易明的防騙訊息，並在過去五年舉辦多項「提子」防騙宣傳活動。隨着相關宣傳工作的推廣及社會各界的努力下，騙案數字的按年增幅已由二○二○年的近九成，放緩至去年的百分之十一點七，反映市民的防騙意識有所提升。

未來，政府將繼續支持相關機構及持份者合作推出針對性的宣傳活動，以提升公眾的防騙意識。"
LCQ17: Combating online investment scams,2025-07-09 14:30,2025-07-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900268.htm," Following is a question by Professor the Hon Priscilla Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 According to the data provided by the Government in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council in June this year, the Police recorded a total of 1 534 cases of online investment scams involving an amount of about $1.02 billion in the first four months of this year. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has launched anti-scam publicity and education programmes targeting three common investment scam scenarios, whether the Government has formulated specific measures to support SFC's anti-scam publicity programmes, so as to raise public vigilance against investment scams; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has plans to strengthen its co-operation with the SFC to update and enhance investor education, so as to ensure that investors can effectively identify and guard against emerging investment risks as well as evolving fraudulent practices and technologies; and

(3) whether it has devised further strategies or allocated additional resources to extend the impact of the ""Don't be Sucker"" anti-scam publicity campaign launched by the SFC, so as to enable more investors to benefit from the campaign and avoid becoming victims of online investment scams; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Government attaches great importance to investor education, and is committed to supporting the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and its subsidiary, the Investor and Financial Education Council (IFEC), in enhancing the financial literacy of the public through various means and channels. In consultation with the Security Bureau, the SFC and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), my reply to the various parts of the question is as follows.

(1) and (2) In the first five months of 2025, there were 1 849 cases of online investment scams recorded by the Police, involving about $1.24 billion. The Government accords high priority to investor protection, and strives to combat online investment scams through two main directions, namely promotion and enforcement.

 On promotion, the Government, together with the SFC and the IFEC, has been striving to enhance investors' anti-financial scam capabilities, raise the public's knowledge in relevant financial products, and remind investors of the risks associated with digital finance.

 In March 2025, the IFEC in collaboration with various stakeholders organised the ""Hong Kong Money Month"" with the theme of ""Guard against Fraud Thrive with Resilience"" to comprehensively promote anti-scam messages by publicising anti-scam information targeting different segments of the community through cross-media promotion. The promotion videos recorded a total of 20.6 million views during the promotion period. In the face of ever-changing technology and evolving fraud tactics, the IFEC has also introduced various anti-financial scam education resources, animated videos, online seminars, etc to educate the public on safeguarding against investment scams including ""ramp and dump"" schemes, social media investment groups, fraudulent trading apps or investment platforms, impersonation scams, deepfake technology and phishing messages, etc. The IFEC website also features fraud prevention online games and an anti-scam online quiz, enabling the public to gain anti-scam knowledge through engaging and interactive games.

 The IFEC launched Hong Kong's first digital financial education experiential learning centre, the IFEC FinEd Hub, in March 2024 to offer investment and anti-scam education to a wider audience through immersive and interactive learning experiences. The FinEd Hub features various interactive anti-scam games for visitors to learn how to identify and respond to various financial scams. As of end-June 2025, the FinEd Hub has recorded over 26 500 visits, with the vast majority of visitors indicating that their visit had enhanced their anti-scam knowledge.

 On the other hand, the HKMA has introduced ""Money Safe"" with banks to provide an extra layer of security to customers' bank deposits. ""Money Safe"" enables customers to segregate a portion of their deposits maintained at banks, protecting them from fund outflows through online and other channels. When releasing the protected deposits, customers would need to undertake extra verification process by staff at bank branches. All retail banks will fully implement ""Money Safe"" by the end of this year.

 As regards enforcement actions against online investment scams, given that most fraud cases in Hong Kong currently involve the use of stooge accounts for receiving funds, targeting such accounts is an effective way to disrupt the fraud value chain. In the first five months of 2025, the Police arrested a total of 3 028 persons in connection with various fraud and money laundering offences, about 70 per cent of whom were holders of stooge accounts. Since the end of 2023, the Police have also applied to the courts to invoke section 27 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) to seek enhanced penalties for cases involving stooge accounts, so as to strengthen deterrence. There have been cases where convicted stooge account holders received sentences increased by more than 30 per cent.

 The Hong Kong Police Force, together with the police authorities of the Macao Special Administrative Region, Malaysia, Maldives, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand, has also conducted the first joint operation under the anti-fraud cross-boundary co-operation platform ""FRONTIER+"" to jointly combat cross-boundary fraud criminal activity. The operation successfully identified and dismantled multiple cross-boundary fraud syndicates, resulting in the arrest of 1 858 persons and involving 9 268 fraud cases, including investment fraud. In addition, noting the increase in online investment scams at the beginning of 2025, the Hong Kong Police have, over the past few months, held press conferences from time to time and stepped up publicity through various channels to remind the public to remain vigilant.

(3) The SFC launched a new anti-scam campaign ""Don't be Sucker"" in December 2024 to caution the public against common tactics used in fraudulent schemes. An original cartoon character ""Shui Yu"", symbolising an impulsive and gullible personality that easily fall prey to investment scams, debuted in the campaign.

 Complementing the SFC's focused promotion of three common scams that the public should avoid (namely online romance scams, impersonation, and deceptive tips from financial influencers), the SFC has rolled out an original campaign theme song and a music video featuring ""Shui Yu"", which has recorded over one million views within about three months since its launch. As of end-June 2025, the SFC has published about 50 posts on the social media platform of ""Shui Yu"", which has attracted more than 1 500 followers and over 423 000 views by unique users.

 To further promote anti-scam messages through ""Shui Yu"", the SFC has produced ""Shui Yu""-themed messaging app stickers to spread anti-scam messages in a light-hearted way. Apart from various online and offline advertisements, the SFC extended the ""Don't be Sucker"" anti-scam publicity campaign through MTR station commercials and a TV infotainment programme in May to June 2025, garnering more than 1.6 million views in estimate.

 In fact, the Government has been proactively enhancing public awareness of various kinds of scams. The Police have set up the Anti-Deception Coordination Centre since July 2017 to consolidate the efforts of the Police in combating and preventing scams, and have introduced various initiatives including the 24-hour enquiry hotline ""Anti-Scam Helpline 18222"", and the ""Upstream Scam Intervention"" scheme to actively identify potential scam victims.

 In addition, the Police have introduced an anti-scam mascot ""The Little Grape"" since June 2020 to explain the latest tactics of scammers and disseminate simple anti-scam messages in a friendly and interactive manner. Various ""TheLittle Grape"" anti-scam promotional campaigns have also been organised over the past five years. Thanks to these initiatives and the collective efforts of the community, the annual growth rate of scam cases has significantly decelerated from nearly 90 per cent in 2020 to 11.7 per cent last year, indicating a rise in public awareness of scam prevention.

 Going forward, the Government will continue to support relevant organisations and stakeholders in collaboratively launching targeted promotion activities to raise the anti-scam awareness of the public."
立法會三題：路旁環保斗,2025-07-09 14:20,2025-07-09 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900416.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳沛良議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的答覆︰

問題：

有意見認為非法佔用公共道路的路旁環保斗不單影響道路使用者安全，也構成環境衞生問題。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年香港警務處和地政總署就路旁環保斗所採取的執法行動資料，包括接獲的投訴或轉介個案數目、張貼法定通知或向營運商發出警告，以及移走環保斗的數目；當中提出檢控，以及被定罪的個案宗數和有關判罰分別為何；

（二）現時四幅供業界存放環保斗用地的使用情況為何；鑑於政府於二○二三年五月回覆本會質詢時表示，位於將軍澳第137區的存放環保斗用地將成為新社區的一部分，政府將適時作出安排，有關安排的進展為何，包括會否尋覓其他用地供環保斗業界營運；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為規管路旁環保斗涉及多個政府部門，政府會否考慮由指定部門全權負責以提高執法效率；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

建築工地、進行修葺的樓宇及店舖裝修工程等，都會產生建築廢料，然後運往政府的堆填區或填料庫處理。以往沒有環保斗的日子，不少建築地盤和裝修工程產生的廢物在等待運送時需要堆放在路旁，破壞環境整潔衞生之餘，也對附近居民和行人造成滋擾，甚至影響道路安全。環保斗可以存放較大量的廢物，特別是建築廢料。使用環保斗，可以避免廢物四處擺放，有助維持環境整潔衞生和道路安全，亦有助從事建築和裝修的業界人士以較整潔有序的方式處置廢物。

環保斗主要是放置在使用的場地，例如建築地盤、裝修工地、商場、住宅屋苑，或鄰近的指定地點，用以收集在附近樓宇進行裝修或建築工程產生的建築廢料。不在使用中的閒置環保斗，則需要尋找地方放置。根據與業界的問卷調查，香港約有1 500個環保斗，當中約一半需要地方放置，但全港現時只有四幅用地，可以用作存放總共330個閒置環保斗，這導致一些營運者將環保斗擺放在路旁或其他不適當的地方。

環保斗的管理涉及多個政策局和部門。政府通過「管理路旁環保斗聯合工作小組」（工作小組），協調環境及生態局、發展局、運輸及物流局、環境保護署、地政總署、運輸署、路政署、警務處、食物環境衞生署及民政事務總署等部門進行加強管理路旁環保斗的工作。由於放置在路旁的環保斗也是一個地區關注的問題，政務司副司長亦透過跨部門會議，與各相關政策局及部門跟進有關事宜。

就陳沛良議員的提問，經諮詢警務處和地政總署，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）現時，警方根據《簡易程序治罪條例》（第228章）處理涉及路旁環保斗的投訴。警方在過去五年合共接獲5913宗涉及環保斗的投訴。警方執法人員會在現場評估實際情況，在找到環保斗營運者時發出勸喻及／或警告，當中大部分的環保斗在接獲勸喻及／或警告後數小時內由營運商自行移走。另由警方僱用承辦商將環保斗移走的個案數目共五宗。警方以傳票方式作出檢控及定罪的個案數目共18宗，有關人士已被法庭判以罰款300元至9,000元。

地政總署在過去五年合共接獲3674宗涉及環保斗的投訴。當中經部門（包括警務處）轉介的個案平均佔總體約3%，餘下97%為市民投訴。在接到投訴／轉介起兩個工作日內，地政總署會進行實地視察，並根據《土地（雜項條文）條例》（第28章）第6條張貼通知，要求相關人士在不少於一整天的指定限期前，移走環保斗及停止佔用該政府土地，否則會由地政總署的承辦商移走。過去五年，地政總署共移走了27個環保斗，而其餘的環保斗都在限期屆滿前被有關人士自行移走。

（二）正如上述，香港估計約有1 500個環保斗，考慮工作輪轉等因素，業界估計每天約有600至700個閒置環保斗需要地方擺放。現時政府透過短期租約機制，為業界提供四幅用地用作存放閒置環保斗，分別位於百勝角、將軍澳第137區填料庫旁、屯門小冷水和毗鄰青衣青南街的用地，合共提供330個泊位。其中，位於百勝角的用地可存放約110個環保斗；位於將軍澳第137區填料庫旁的用地可存放約120個環保斗；位於屯門小冷水的用地可存放約80個環保斗；而位於青衣青南街的用地可存放約20個環保斗。

為配合將軍澳第137區未來發展成住宅社區，按照目前的工程時間表，用作存放環保斗的短期租約用地預計最早須於二○二六年第二季歸還。另一方面，政府已完成位於大嶼山青洲灣的用地的公開招標程序，初步預計該用地可存放約100個環保斗，預計於今年內批出。為協助改善一些營運者將環保斗擺放在路旁或其他不適當的地方的情況，工作小組會努力尋找其他及更多合適用地以短期租約方式租予環保斗營運業界存放閒置環保斗。

（三）管理在路旁擺放環保斗的工作，涉及不同部門的工作和法例，政府通過工作小組，協調有關部門的工作，是有其原因和需要。政府會多管齊下，尋求更有效的管理辦法改善環保斗不當擺放的問題。現階段，政府會針對違規放在路旁並且對道路安全造成風險的個案加強執法行動。

多謝主席。"
LCQ3: Roadside skips,2025-07-09 14:20,2025-07-09 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900417.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Pui-leung and a reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

There are views that roadside skips unlawfully occupying public roads not only affects the safety of road users, but also poses environmental hygiene problems. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the information on the enforcement actions taken by the Hong Kong Police Force and the Lands Department against roadside skips in the past five years, including the number of complaints or referrals received, the number of statutory notices posted or warnings issued to operators, as well as the number of skips removed; among them, the number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted and the number of convicted cases, as well as the relevant penalties imposed;

(2) of the current utilisation situations of the four sites made available for use by the trade for storing skips; as the Government indicated in its reply to a question raised by this Council in May 2023 that the skip storage site in Tseung Kwan O Area 137 would become part of the new community, and that the Government would make arrangements in due course, of the progress of the relevant arrangements, including whether alternative sites will be identified for the operation of the skips trade; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that the regulation of roadside skips involves a number of government departments, whether the Government will consider assigning a designated department to take full responsibility so as to improve enforcement efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Construction waste is generated from construction sites, buildings under maintenance and shops under renovation, which is then transported to landfills or public fill banks for handling. Before skips emerged in the market, most construction waste from construction and renovation sites were piled up at roadside before it was collected for delivery. This not only affected the environmental hygiene, but also caused nuisance to residents and pedestrians, and even affected the road safety. Skips could store relatively large quantity of waste, in particular, construction waste. Using skips can avoid waste being placed everywhere and help maintain a clean and hygienic environment and road safety. It also helps the construction and renovation industry handle construction waste in a neat and orderly way.

Skips are primarily placed at site of use, such as construction sites, renovation sites, shopping malls, housing estates and designated locations nearby, to collect construction waste generated by construction or renovation works in the buildings nearby. Skips that are not being used need to be stored. According to the result of a questionnaire survey with the trade, there are about 1 500 roadside skips in Hong Kong. Among these, about half of them need to be stored while there is only storage space for 330 skips on four pieces of land provided. Under such a circumstance, some skip operators may place the skips at roadside or other improper locations.

Management of skips involves various bureaux and departments. Through the Joint Working Group on Management of Roadside Skips (Working Group), the Government coordinates the work on enhancing management of roadside skips among the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Transport and Logistics Bureau, the Environmental Protection Department, the Lands Department (LandsD), the Transport Department, the Highways Department, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, and the Home Affairs Department. Since skips placed on at roadside is also a problem of district concern, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration also looks into this problem with the bureaux and departments concerned through inter-departmental meetings.

In response to the question raised by the Hon Chan Pui-leung, in consultation with the HKPF and the LandsD, a consolidated reply is as follows:

(1) Currently, the HKPF handles complaints involving roadside skips in accordance with the Summary Offences Ordinance (Cap. 228). Over the past five years, the HKPF has received a total of 5913 complaints about skips. Police officers will, in light of the circumstances at the scene, make assessments and issue advice and/or warnings to the skip operators concerned if found. In most cases, the operators would remove the skips on their own within hours after receiving the advice and/or warning, with five cases requiring the HKPF to engage contractors to remove the skips. A total of 18 cases were prosecuted under police summons and were convicted. The convicted persons were fined between $300 and $9,000 by the court.

Over the past five years, the LandsD has received a total of 3674 complaints concerning skips. Among these complaints, 3 per cent were referred by other departments (including the HKPF), and the other 97 per cent were lodged by the public. Within two working days upon receiving a complaint or referral, the LandsD will conduct an on-site inspection and post a notice according to Section 6 of the Land (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 28) requiring the person concerned to remove the skip and to stop occupying the government land before the specified deadline no less than one clear day, otherwise it will be removed by the LandsD's contractor. Over the past five years, the LandsD has removed a total of 27 skips, with the remaining removed by relevant persons on their own before the deadlines.

(2) As mentioned above, there are about 1 500 skips in Hong Kong. Considering factors such as job rotations, the trade estimates that about 600 to 700 idling skips would require space for storage each day. At present, the Government has provided four sites to the trade for storage of idling skips through short-term tenancy mechanism. These sites are located at Pak Shing Kok, an area next to the Tseung Kwan O Area 137 (TKO 137) Fill Bank, Siu Lang Shui in Tuen Mun, and adjacent to Tsing Nam Street in Tsing Yi respectively, altogether providing storage space for a total of 330 skips. The site at Pak Shing Kok can store about 110 skips; the site next to the TKO 137 Fill Bank can store about 120 skips; the site at Siu Lang Shui in Tuen Mun can store about 80 skips; and the site at Tsing Nam Street in Tsing Yi can store about 20 skips.

To tie in with the future residential development of TKO 137, according to the current development timetable, the site leased to the trade under short-term tenancy for storing skips is expected to be returned in the second quarter of 2026 the earliest. Meanwhile, the Government has completed the open tendering process for a site at Tsing Chau Wan on Lantau Island, which is initially expected to accommodate approximately 100skips and to be awarded within this year. To further improve the situation that some skip operators placed their skips at roadside or other improper locations, the Working Group also strives to find more suitable sites for skip storage by the trade through short-term tenancy tenders.

(3)The management of roadside skips involves works of different departments and various pieces of legislation. Hence, the Government has its reason and need to coordinate relevant departments' work through the Working Group. The Government is adopting a multipronged approach and looking for more effective ways to improve the problem of improper placement of skips. At the current stage, the Government focuses on enhancing enforcement on illegally placed skips that pose safety risk to road users.

Thank you, President."
Speech by FS at Korea-Hong Kong Business Luncheon (English only) (with photos/video),2025-07-09 14:08,2025-07-09 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900535.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Korea–Hong Kong Business Luncheon held in Seoul, Korea, today (July 9):

Mr Joo Yong-tae (Deputy Mayor for Economy, Seoul), Mr Kevin Lee (Director of the International Trade Division of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Annyeonghaseyo. Good afternoon. It is both a pleasure and honour to be here with you today in Seoul.

 Let me begin by extending my warmest greetings and heartfelt appreciation to the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry and our ETO (Economic and Trade Office) colleagues for organising this luncheon.

Hong Kong: good for business

 Allow me to start by offering a brief snapshot of where Hong Kong stands today.

 Hong Kong has been back on a path of growth following the global challenges of the pandemic. In 2024, we recorded a GDP growth of 2.5 per cent. This year, despite continued global uncertainties from tariff war to geopolitical tensions, our economy recorded a 3.1 per cent growth in the first quarter. Our merchandise exports continued to register strong double-digit growth.

 Foreign businesses continue to cast a vote of confidence in our city. In 2024, the number of overseas and Mainland companies operating in Hong Kong reached an all-time high at nearly 10 000. American and European companies rose by around 10 per cent, while Korean companies rose by 9 per cent year on year. 

 Hong Kong continues to shine in international rankings. We are among the world’s top three global financial centres. The latest IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Ranking places us as the third most competitive economy worldwide. Last October, the Fraser Institute reaffirmed our position as the world’s freest economy. These accolades are no coincidence. They are the result of persistent hard work to drive our competitiveness forward, backed by transparent, consistent and predictable policies, market openness and global connectivity.

 A critical foundation of our success is a stable and secure environment. This year marks the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law. It restores law and order in Hong Kong and provides confidence to the international business community. Indeed, a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce (in Hong Kong) in January this year showed that (more than) 80 per cent of its members expressed confidence in Hong Kong’s rule of law. And 70 per cent reported that the National Security Law had no impact on their business operations.

 Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong continues to be an open, diverse and international city. We are a free port, uphold a freely convertible currency pegged to the US dollar, ensure the free flow of capital, goods, information and talent, and practise the common law system.

 President Xi Jinping and the Central Government of China have made clear that the ""one country, two systems"" framework is here to stay for the long term.

 Investor confidence is reflected in hard data. Our stock market, for example, rose by 18 per cent last year, and has gained another 20 per cent this year. Initial public offerings (IPOs) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange have raised about US$16 billion so far this year, making Hong Kong the top IPO venue globally to date. The total bank deposits grew by 7 per cent last year and another 7 per cent this year, now exceeding US$2.3 trillion, six times our GDP.

The Greater Bay Area

 Meanwhile, Hong Kong is the international gateway to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, or GBA, which is an economic powerhouse with 87 million people and a combined GDP of US$2 trillion. With a per capita GDP of US$23,000, or US$40,000 on a purchasing power parity basis, the GBA is not just a manufacturing base, but also a sophisticated, high-growth consumer market.

 The region is deeply interconnected. High-speed rail puts us just 15 minutes from Shenzhen and 45 minutes from Guangzhou. With seven international airports and a combined annual passenger throughput of over 200 million, the GBA sits within a five-hour flight radius of half the world’s population. Hong Kong International Airport, the world’s busiest cargo airport, now operates with a third runway and is gearing up to handle 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2035.

 The GBA is also a cradle of innovation. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster ranks second globally in innovation, and has done so for five consecutive years. Hong Kong excels in basic research, anchored by five universities ranked among the world's top 100. Three of them are in the global top 20 for data science and AI; our two medical schools are ranked among the top 40. Meanwhile, Shenzhen and Guangzhou lead in commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. Together, the GBA is like fusing the financial power of New York with the innovation energy of Silicon Valley.

Opportunities for Korean businesses

 So, what does this mean for Korean businesses?

 First, Hong Kong’s financial markets offer unparalleled connectivity and liquidity. We serve as a two-way platform, connecting international capital with Mainland markets and vice versa. Through our Connect Schemes, including Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and ETF (Exchange-traded Fund) Connect, and more, Mainland investors can access Hong Kong’s markets, while global investors can access the Mainland through Hong Kong.

 The recent surge in our stock market reflects two important trends. First, the rebalancing act of international investors to diversify risks out of global economic uncertainty, particularly in the US; and second, optimism about China's technology prowess demonstrated by DeepSeek and others. Korean investors have already taken note. And they are apt in taking actions. In February this year, we saw the highest level of Korean investment into our stock market in over three years.

 Beyond the stock market, asset and wealth management is another area where we are seeing rapid growth. Hong Kong now manages over US$4 trillion in assets. With a growing ecosystem of related financial services, we are on track to become the world’s largest cross-border wealth management hub by 2028. For Korean firms in private banking and asset management, the opportunities are significant. Indeed, many American and European asset and wealth managers have been expanding their hiring and office accommodation in the city.

 Hong Kong also serves as a powerful springboard for Korean goods, not just into the GBA or the Chinese Mainland, but across the entire ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. As a duty-free port with seamless customs clearance and unmatched connectivity, Hong Kong offers Korean exporters a fast, cost-effective and reliable route to high-growth markets. From electronics and cosmetics to food products and fashion, Hong Kong is your launchpad.

 In innovation and technology, Hong Kong is making strategic and forward-looking moves. We are placing particular emphasis on the development of key sectors such as artificial intelligence and biotech. In addition to our world-class research capabilities, Hong Kong is where Mainland and international data converge. This is a distinct competitive advantage for data-intensive industries. 

 Our close collaboration with other cities in the GBA is further accelerating this momentum. Along our boundary with neighbouring Shenzhen, we are developing a joint innovation and technology park, where we are piloting innovative policies to facilitate the seamless flow of data, talent, capital and even biosamples. We have also established joint clinical trial centres to expedite drug development and streamline cross-boundary regulatory approvals. For Korean tech and pharmaceutical firms seeking expansion and collaboration opportunities, Hong Kong is your ideal location.

The pleasures of life

 Beyond business, Hong Kong is a city alive with culture, diversity, and global connectivity. We are a true melting pot of East and West. Korean culture, from K-pop to kimchi, has found a warm and enthusiastic following in Hong Kong. And we are glad that more and more Korean visitors are coming to our city to see for themselves our vibrancy. In the first half of this year, Hong Kong welcomes more than half a million of Korean visitors, a 25 per cent increase year on year.

 The pleasures of life are part of our fabric. With more than 200 Michelin-recognised restaurants, hiking trails minutes from the city, and a coastline that rivals the best in the region, Hong Kong offers not only opportunity, but quality of life. Above all, Hong Kong remains one of the safest cities in the world, a place you can walk freely, day or night.

 And we are just getting started. The newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park offers a world-class, multipurpose venue for sport and entertainment events. In January next year, we’re excited to welcome BLACKPINK to our stage. And who knows, NewJeans and aespa may not be far behind!

 Ladies and gentlemen, I hope I've been able to offer you a fresh perspective on Hong Kong, not just as a financial centre or trade hub, but as a dynamic, welcoming city filled with opportunity, energy and creativity. A city where Korean businesses, investors and talents can thrive.

 If I may, let me now share a short video that captures the vibrancy, openness and possibilities of Hong Kong today.

 That is Hong Kong - dynamic and welcoming. A city that means business, and a city that celebrates life. We look forward to welcoming you soon, to Hong Kong.

 Kamsahamnida. Thank you very much."

Meanwhile, Shenzhen and Guangzhou lead in commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. Together, the GBA is like fusing the financial power of New York with the innovation energy of Silicon Valley.

Opportunities for Korean businesses

 So, what does this mean for Korean businesses?

 First, Hong Kong’s financial markets offer unparalleled connectivity and liquidity. We serve as a two-way platform, connecting international capital with Mainland markets and vice versa. Through our Connect Schemes, including Stock Connect, Bond Connect, and ETF (Exchange-traded Fund) Connect, and more, Mainland investors can access Hong Kong’s markets, while global investors can access the Mainland through Hong Kong.

 The recent surge in our stock market reflects two important trends. First, the rebalancing act of international investors to diversify risks out of global economic uncertainty, particularly in the US; and second, optimism about China's technology prowess demonstrated by DeepSeek and others. Korean investors have already taken note. And they are apt in taking actions. In February this year, we saw the highest level of Korean investment into our stock market in over three years.

 Beyond the stock market, asset and wealth management is another area where we are seeing rapid growth. Hong Kong now manages over US$4 trillion in assets. With a growing ecosystem of related financial services, we are on track to become the world’s largest cross-border wealth management hub by 2028. For Korean firms in private banking and asset management, the opportunities are significant. Indeed, many American and European asset and wealth managers have been expanding their hiring and office accommodation in the city.

 Hong Kong also serves as a powerful springboard for Korean goods, not just into the GBA or the Chinese Mainland, but across the entire ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region. As a duty-free port with seamless customs clearance and unmatched connectivity, Hong Kong offers Korean exporters a fast, cost-effective and reliable route to high-growth markets. From electronics and cosmetics to food products and fashion, Hong Kong is your launchpad.

 In innovation and technology, Hong Kong is making strategic and forward-looking moves. We are placing particular emphasis on the development of key sectors such as artificial intelligence and biotech. In addition to our world-class research capabilities, Hong Kong is where Mainland and international data converge. This is a distinct competitive advantage for data-intensive industries. 

 Our close collaboration with other cities in the GBA is further accelerating this momentum. Along our boundary with neighbouring Shenzhen, we are developing a joint innovation and technology park, where we are piloting innovative policies to facilitate the seamless flow of data, talent, capital and even biosamples. We have also established joint clinical trial centres to expedite drug development and streamline cross-boundary regulatory approvals. For Korean tech and pharmaceutical firms seeking expansion and collaboration opportunities, Hong Kong is your ideal location.

The pleasures of life

 Beyond business, Hong Kong is a city alive with culture, diversity, and global connectivity. We are a true melting pot of East and West. Korean culture, from K-pop to kimchi, has found a warm and enthusiastic following in Hong Kong. And we are glad that more and more Korean visitors are coming to our city to see for themselves our vibrancy. In the first half of this year, Hong Kong welcomes more than half a million of Korean visitors, a 25 per cent increase year on year.

 The pleasures of life are part of our fabric. With more than 200 Michelin-recognised restaurants, hiking trails minutes from the city, and a coastline that rivals the best in the region, Hong Kong offers not only opportunity, but quality of life. Above all, Hong Kong remains one of the safest cities in the world, a place you can walk freely, day or night.

 And we are just getting started. The newly opened Kai Tak Sports Park offers a world-class, multipurpose venue for sport and entertainment events. In January next year, we’re excited to welcome BLACKPINK to our stage. And who knows, NewJeans and aespa may not be far behind!

 Ladies and gentlemen, I hope I've been able to offer you a fresh perspective on Hong Kong, not just as a financial centre or trade hub, but as a dynamic, welcoming city filled with opportunity, energy and creativity. A city where Korean businesses, investors and talents can thrive.

 If I may, let me now share a short video that captures the vibrancy, openness and possibilities of Hong Kong today.

 That is Hong Kong - dynamic and welcoming. A city that means business, and a city that celebrates life. We look forward to welcoming you soon, to Hong Kong.

 Kamsahamnida. Thank you very much."
​政府調整交通相關費用和定額罰款,2025-07-09 13:32,2025-07-09 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900333.htm,"政府今日（七月九日）宣布，建議調整四項與交通相關的費用，包括隧道收費、電動私家車牌照費、停車收費錶最高收費，以及交通違例事項定額罰款。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「二零二五至二六年度《財政預算案》公布政府會重點檢視多年未曾調整的交通收費和定額罰款。我們的總體考量是提升交通管理，以及維持公共財政紀律，以體現『收回成本』和『用者自付』原則。」

為此，政府制定合共四項法例修訂：

（一）《2025年行車隧道（政府）（修訂）（第2號）規例》──調整隧道收費

政府以科學為本，以四大原則按優次檢視了政府隧道和主幹道的收費，包括交通管理需要、效率優先、公共交通優先，以及「用者自付」。在綜合考慮上述四項原則和每條隧道和主幹道的具體情況，決定建議調高香港仔隧道和城門隧道的隧道費，並就使用中九龍繞道徵收隧道費。香港仔隧道和城門隧道的新收費將於二○二五年九月二十一日生效；中九龍繞道將於二○二六年全線通車時，開始實施收費。詳情如下：





現行隧道費
			（所有車輛全日劃一收費）
建議隧道費
			（所有車輛全日劃一收費）


香港仔隧道
5元
8元


城門隧道
5元
8元


中九龍繞道（油麻地段隧道）
／
8元




運輸及物流局發言人說：「香港仔隧道和城門隧道已34年未有調整收費，至今通脹已超過百分之一百三十，隧道出現營運虧損。調整收費至8元對交通造成的影響輕微，隧道營運可因此達致收支平衡。另一方面，中九龍繞道將紓緩現時九龍主要幹道的交通，路程短、車速高，對駕駛者的吸引力甚大。如中九龍繞道不予收費，預計剛開通使用率便將接近飽和。考慮到立法會交通事務委員會及回應社會意見，並吸引更多駕駛者使用，以達致有效分流，政府現提出8元收費。相關收費水平將有效分流九龍區內主要繁忙道路整體約百分之二十的車流之餘，亦能為繞道保留約百分之十五的剩餘容車量以應付未來交通增長，並可收回近八成的基本營運成本；而按效率優先原則，商用車輛和公交車輛須繳付的費用與體積較小的私家車的溫和收費一致。」

發言人續指：「我們亦已按上述四項原則逐一審視其他政府隧道及主幹道。總括而言，考慮到其他政府隧道及主幹道的交通管理和流量、替代路線的交通流量，以及與每條路線相關未來的交通基建配套，例如新的替代路線落成，我們建議暫時維持它們現有的收費安排，適時再作檢視。」

（二）《2025年道路交通（車輛登記及領牌）（修訂）（第4號）規例》──理順電動私家車牌照費架構和水平

現時，電動私家車的牌照費按車輛淨重收費，電動私家車的牌照費與燃油私家車的牌照費之間的差距為約六倍。政府建議調整電動私家車每年牌照費的收費架構，改以電動私家車的額定功率收取牌照費，把電動私家車的牌照費結構按額定功率分為五個層級，並適當地調整牌照費水平，調整進程會分五階段在六年間進行，以配合科技發展和緊貼其他地區做法。新牌照費架構將於二○二五年十一月一日起實施，適用於新登記的電動私家車，而現有電動私家車可獲四個月寬限期。詳情撮述如下：

			＊四個月的牌照費用為相關每年牌照費的百分之三十五，以及附加費30元。




擁有電動私家車的合資格傷殘人士會獲得電動私家車牌照費寬減安排（註）。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「考慮到立法會交通事務委員會的意見，電動私家車的牌照費調整分五階段逐步實施，讓市民有較長的適應期。新的電動私家車牌照費水平完成調整後，與現時燃油車的牌照費比較，仍會低百分之二十五（第五層級）至百分之四十（第一層級）不等，以繼續鼓勵駕駛者轉用電動車，推動環保。按現時登記電動私家車的類型分布，有百分之九十九的車輛處於第一、二及三層級；而處於第四及第五層級的車輛數目比例僅分別為百分之一和百分之零點一。隨着電動車日趨普及，市場上有越來越多電動車品牌和型號選擇，同時電動車燃料費用及維修保養費較燃油車低，我們預計在新措施下，電動車仍維持吸引力。」

（三）《2025年道路交通（泊車）（修訂）規例》──調整停車收費錶收費

為妥善運用有限的泊車位資源，政府建議調整使用停車收費錶泊車位（俗稱「咪錶」）的最高收費，由每15分鐘2元調整至每15分鐘4元，即每小時最高收費為16元，以加快停車收費錶泊車位的流轉，滿足駕駛者短期泊車需求。新收費將於二○二五年九月二十八日起實施。至於貨車、巴士及旅遊巴士泊車位的現有收費錶收費水平，一律維持不變。

（四）根據《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》（第237章）和《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》（第240章）動議的擬議決議案──調整交通違例事項定額罰款

為加強保障交通安全和交通暢順，政府建議違例泊車的定額罰款額由現時320元調高至400元（調整幅度為百分之二十五），其他與道路安全和交通擠塞相關的十九項（詳見附件）違例事項的定額罰款額由現時的320元至1,000元不等，調高至480元至1,500元不等（調整幅度為百分之五十）。其他交通罪行的罰款額則維持不變。

運輸及物流局發言人說：「違例泊車和大部分交通違例事項的定額罰款已31年未曾調整，罰款額的阻嚇力或因期間的通脹而有所抵銷；而事實上，香港的交通違例事項的定額罰款水平遠較多個其他地區為低。我們注意到部分交通罪行數字仍有上升或居高不下的趨勢。調整相關交通罪行的罰款額有助提高阻嚇力，加強保障道路安全和暢順。與此同時，政府會致力加大泊車位供應，以盡量滿足泊車需求。」

《2025年行車隧道（政府）（修訂）（第2號）規例》、《2025年道路交通（車輛登記及領牌）（修訂）（第4號）規例》，以及《2025年道路交通（泊車）（修訂）規例》將於七月十八日刊憲，並於七月二十三日提交立法會進行先訂立後審議的程序。至於《定額罰款（交通違例事項）條例》（第237章）和《定額罰款（刑事訴訟）條例》（第240章）附表的交通違例事項的罰則，立法會可藉決議修訂（按先審議後訂立的程序），運輸及物流局局長將於七月三十日的立法會會議上動議通過決議。有關立法建議和生效日期分別在各修訂規例及擬議決議案中訂明，相關資料載列於政府於今日發出的立法會參考資料摘要。

註：如合資格傷殘人士名下電動私家車的額定功率不超過75千瓦，則無須繳付牌照費。如其額定功率超過75千瓦，其應繳每年牌照費為其額定功率層級訂明的每年牌照費減去額定功率不超過75千瓦的電動私家車所應繳的每年牌照費。"

答覆：

主席：

為應對院舍人手不足和新增的人手需求，以及協助院舍業界提升服務質素，政府二○二三年六月推出「院舍輸入護理員特別計劃」（「特別計劃」），在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許安老院及殘疾人士院舍輸入護理員。「特別計劃」推出時設有7000個輸入配額，包括原有經「補充勞工計劃」已輸入的約4000名護理員。有關名額於二○二四年上半年接近用罄。政府在檢視業界對護理員的需求和人手供應情況後，同年七月公布把配額上限提高至15000個，在隨後三年分批提供予院舍申請。

就議員的提問，綜合社會福利署（社署）、勞工處及政府統計處（統計處）的資料及數據，現答覆如下：

（一）至（三）過去三年全港安老院及殘疾人士院舍所聘用的本地及輸入護理員人數載於附件一。「特別計劃」首五輪的申請和審批結果詳情載於附件二，其中約400宗個案遭拒絕，不獲批的主要原因包括該輪申請可獲分配的配額已用罄或申請不符合「特別計劃」的規定。第六輪申請在二○二五年五月六日截止，社署正處理約500個新配額申請。

社署有五名人員專責推行「特別計劃」，包括社會工作主任職系、行政主任職系及文書職系的人員。為保障本地勞工的就業機會，社署會抽查申請參與「特別計劃」的院舍所遞交的「本地招聘確認書」，確保院舍已經通過社署署長指定途徑招聘本地人手，但未能填補空缺。至二○二五年三月，社署共抽查約300份院舍本地招聘記錄，佔申請總數超過一成，沒有發現院舍蓄意或存心提交不正確資料，該段期間也沒有院舍遭行政制裁。

（四）至（六）勞工處共有37名勞工督察負責巡查輸入勞工的工作地點及僱主在香港為輸入勞工提供的居所。過去兩年，勞工督察共進行4407次有關輸入護理員的巡查（包括補充勞工計劃／優化補充勞工計劃以及「特別計劃」下的個案），包括2298次僱傭地點巡查及2109次居所巡查。巡查如發現輸入勞工的僱傭權益受損，勞工處會立即跟進調查。視察巡查過程中收到的投訴已計入整體投訴個案數字。

自二○二三年六月推出「特別計劃」至二○二五年五月，勞工處和社署共接獲47宗懷疑院舍違反法例或「特別計劃」規定的投訴。投訴事項主要涉及工資（包括工資回扣及短付工資）及工作安排。上述投訴個案中，有八宗涉及院舍涉嫌以輸入護理員取代在職本地護理員，其中七‍宗投訴已完成調查，並沒有發現違規事項，而餘下一宗仍在調查中。同期，勞工處成功檢控一名在「特別計劃」下聘用輸入護理員的僱主，該僱主違反《僱員補償條例》，未有投購有效的僱員補償保險，被法庭判處罰款2,500元。社署正審視有關個案，會按情況考慮施加行政制裁。

自「特別計劃」推出至今，投訴、檢控及定罪個案的數字按年表列如下：

（七）「特別計劃」規定，本地護理員的薪金必須不低於輸入護理員，而輸入護理員的薪金不得低於統計處最新編製的護理員每月工資中位數（註一）。護理員每月中位工資根據統計處在五月至六月期間進行的「收入及工時按年統計調查」所搜集的數據編製而成，統計處多年來均沿用此方式統計不同行業的工資中位數。就院舍護理員的工資中位數而言，抽樣的院舍包括津助／合約和私營／自負盈虧安老院。

鑑於津助／合約院舍一般可提供更好的薪酬待遇吸引本地求職者，政府推出「特別計劃」時，規定這類院舍須採用較低的輸入護理員比例，即每聘請兩名全職本地員工才可申請輸入一名外地護理員（即2：1），而私營／自負盈虧院舍的適用比例則為1：1。至二○二五年六月底，社署向院舍業界共批出約8300個配額（包括續約配額），當中津助／合約院舍所佔的配額約兩成，而私營／自負盈虧院舍則佔近八成。此外，根據「特別計劃」的規定，僱主只可在未能招聘本地護理員的情況下申請輸入外地護理員。院舍業界普遍認為申請輸入護理員的門檻和實際成本不低。獲准輸入護理員的僱主須為輸入護理員提供住宿。輸入護理員如生病或受傷，無論是否因受僱而引致，僱主須提供免費醫療服務。如僱主為輸入護理員提供膳食，則必須是免費的。院舍亦須為每名輸入護理員每月繳付$400「僱員再培訓徵款」。

註一：根據統計處最新數字，二○二四年護理員每月中位工資為$15,120元（以最近的十位數顯示）。"

(3)since the implementation of the Special Scheme, of the following information on the spot checks conducted by the authorities on applicant RCHs in accordance with the mechanism of spot checks of local recruitment records during the processing of each round of application: (i) the staffing establishment and strength of personnel conducting the spot checks, (ii) the number of RCHs which had been requested by the Social Welfare Department in its letters to submit detailed local recruitment records, and (iii) their percentage in the total number of applicant RCHs; whether the authorities had found malpractices such as RCHs being suspected of having provided false information or withheld any information during such spot checks; if so, of the details, including the number and nature of the cases, and whether the authorities had imposed administrative sanctions on or instituted prosecutions against the RCHs concerned, together with a breakdown by type of RCHs and their mode of operation;

(4)given that according to the requirements of the Special Scheme, RCHs must not displace their existing local care workers with imported care workers and they must comply with the specified ratio of local employees to imported care workers, of the number of RCHs alleged or substantiated to have breached the aforesaid requirements since the implementation of the Special Scheme, as well as the details of the relevant follow-up actions (including the number of cases in which written warnings were issued to and administrative sanctions were imposed on non-compliant RCHs), together with a breakdown by type of RCHs and their mode of operation;

(5)since the implementation of the Special Scheme, of the following information on the authorities' inspections of the workplaces and accommodations of imported care workers provided by employers in Hong Kong: (i) the staffing establishment and strength of personnel conducting the inspections, (ii) the number of inspections conducted, (iii) the number of workplaces inspected and (iv) the number of accommodations provided by employers which were inspected;

(6) since the implementation of the Special Scheme, of the respective numbers of complaints involving the exploitation of labour rights of imported care workers received by the Government (i) during the inspections mentioned in (5) and (ii) through other channels, and the main nature of such complaints; the respective numbers of administrative sanctions imposed on or prosecutions instituted against the RCHs concerned by the authorities in respect of the complaints received by ways of (i) and (ii), together with a breakdown by type of RCHs and their mode of operation; among the prosecutions instituted, the number of convicted cases and the average penalty imposed; and

(7) as there are views pointing out that the median wage currently stipulated for imported care workers in RCHs under the Special Scheme is lower than the market level, and that the remuneration of local care workers employed by subvented RCHs is in general much higher than the median wage, resulting in less motivation for RCHs to employ local workers, whether the authorities will consider stipulating appropriate median wages for imported care workers in RCHs with different modes of operation, so as to enhance protection for local care workers concerned; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 To address the manpower shortage and new manpower demand in residential care homes (RCHs), and to assist the RCH sector in enhancing their service quality, the Government, on the premise of safeguarding the employment priority for local workers, launched the Special Scheme to Import Care Workers for RCHs (the Special Scheme) in June 2023 to allow residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) and residential care homes for persons with disabilities (RCHDs) to import care workers on an appropriate scale. The Special Scheme set 7000 importation quotas when launched, including around 4000 care workers previously imported through the Supplementary Labour Scheme (SLS), and the relevant quotas were nearly exhausted by the first half of 2024. The Government, having reviewed the demand for and supply of care workers in the sector, announced in July of the same year that the quota ceiling would be adjusted to 15000 for RCHs to apply for by batches in the following three years.

 Our reply to the Member's questions, with consolidated information and data of the Social Welfare Department (SWD), Labour Department (LD) and Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), is as follows:

(1) to (3)The number of local and imported care workers employed by the RCHEs and the RCHDs in Hong Kong in the past three years are set out at Annex 1. The details of the first five rounds of applications and approval results under the Special Scheme are set out at Annex 2, with about 400 rejected cases mainly because the quotas available for that round of applications were exhausted, or the applications did not comply with the requirements of the Special Scheme. The sixth round of applications ended on May 6, 2025, and the SWD is processing the applications for around 500 new quotas.

 There are five staff members in the SWD designated to implement the Special Scheme, including the Social Work Officer grade, the Executive Officer grade and the Clerical grade. To safeguard job opportunities of local care workers, the SWD will conduct random checks on the ""Confirmation of Local Recruitment"" submitted by the RCHs that apply for joining the Special Scheme, with a view to ensuring that they have conducted local recruitment through channel(s) specified by the Director of Social Welfare but have been unsuccessful in filling the vacancies. Up to March 2025, the SWD has conducted random checks on about 300 local recruitment records of the RCHs, accounting for more than 10 per cent of the total number of applications, and found no case of RCH's intentionally or knowingly submitting inaccurate information. Nor has any RCH been imposed administrative sanction during that period of time.

(4) to (6)The LD's Labour Inspectors (LIs) inspect the workplaces of imported workers and the accommodation provided by employers in Hong Kong for imported workers. The establishment and strength of the LIs responsible for the above work is 37. In the past two years, LIs have carried out a total of 4407 inspections relating to imported care workers (including cases under the SLS/Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) and the Special Scheme), including 2298 workplace inspections and 2109 accommodation inspections. Should suspected deprivation of imported workers' rights and benefits be detected during inspection, the LD will promptly conduct follow-up investigation. Complaints received during the inspections are counted towards the overall number of complaint cases.

  Since the launch of the Special Scheme in June 2023 and up to May 2025, the LD and the SWD have received a total of 47 complaints against the RCHs suspected to have breached the law or the requirements of the Special Scheme. The complaints mainly involved wages (including wage rebates and underpayment of wages) and work arrangements. Among them, there were eight complaints received about the displacement of serving local care workers by imported care workers, of which the Government has completed investigation of seven cases and no irregularities were found. The remaining one case is still under investigation. During the same period, the LD successfully prosecuted an employer that had engaged imported care workers under the Special Scheme. The employer violated the Employees' Compensation Ordinance by failing to take out employees' compensation insurance policies and was fined $2,500 by the court. The SWD is examining the case concerned and will consider imposing administrative sanctions as appropriate.

  Since the launch of the Special Scheme, the number of complaint, prosecution and conviction cases per year are tabulated as follows:

(7) The Special Scheme requires that the salary of local care workers must not be lower than those offered to imported care workers, while the salary of imported care workers must not be lower than the latest median monthly wage of care workers (Note 1) as compiled by the C&SD. The median monthly wage of care workers are compiled based on the data obtained from C&SD's Annual Earnings and Hours Survey conducted between May and June. The C&SD has been compiling statistics on the median wages of various industries based on this approach over the years. In respect of the median wage of care workers at RCHs, institutions being sampled include subvented/contract and private/self-financing RCHEs.

  As subvented/contract RCHs can generally offer better remuneration packages to attract local job-seekers, the Government has stipulated that these types of RCHs should adopt a lower ratio of imported care workers when launching the Special Scheme. They are only allowed to, for every two full-time local staff employed, apply for importing one non-local care worker (i.e. 2:1) whereas private/self-financing RCHs can apply to import one non-local care worker for every full-time local employee (i.e. 1:1). Up to end June 2025, the SWD has approved a total of about 8 300 quotas (including contract renewal quotas) for the RCH sector, of which the quotas for subvented/contract RCHs accounted for about 20 per cent while those for private/self-financing RCHs accounted for nearly 80 per cent. In addition, under the Special Scheme, employers may only apply for importation of care workers if they are unable to recruit local care workers. The sector generally opined that the threshold and actual cost of applying to import care workers are not as low. Employers who are allowed to import care workers must provide accommodation for the imported care workers. If an imported care worker becomes ill or injured, regardless of whether that is work-related, his or her employer is required to offer free medical services. The meals for imported care workers, if so provided by an employer, must be free of charge. The RCHs also must pay a monthly ""Employee Retraining Levy"" of $400 per imported care worker. 

Note 1: According to the latest figure of C&SD, the median monthly wage of care workers in 2024 was $15,120 (rounding to the nearest tenth)."

立法會四題：釋放「銀色生產動力」,2025-07-09 12:30,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900299.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林振昇議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

政府於今年五月公布各項促進銀髮經濟措施，有意見認為在釋放「銀色生產動力」方面，當局應推出更多措施協助基層長者解決就業困難和改善待遇。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於不少基層長者反映在目前輸入勞工政策下，僱主傾向聘用較年輕外勞，令長者的工作機會減少，特別是「補充勞工優化計劃」涵蓋的工種，政府會否考慮收緊該計劃，例如就所有工種設立配額上限，以提升長者就業機會；

（二）鑑於有年長求職者反映，即使符合職位要求，但有僱主表明因其年齡較大而拒絕聘請，當局會否積極研究立法，打擊職場年齡歧視；及

（三）政府於二○二三年建議提高僱主為65歲或以上僱員作強積金自願性供款的稅務扣減，鼓勵其為年長僱員供款以增加銀髮族的退休儲蓄，並在二○二四年《施政報告》提出將有關措施納入促進銀髮經濟工作組的工作內，有關措施的推展進度為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府推行一系列措施，協助求職人士就業。因應中高齡人士的就業需要，政府提供多元化的就業支援，以及推廣長者友善僱傭措施，鼓勵及協助他們重返或留任職場，釋放年長人士的勞動力。

勞工處於去年七月十五日推出為期三年的「再就業津貼試行計劃」，鼓勵連續三個月或以上沒有從事獲酬工作的40歲或以上人士，重投就業市場。每名合資格參加者連續完成12個月工作可獲發最高20,000元再就業津貼。計劃的反應十分理想。截至今年六月已錄得超過45000名參加者及接近23000宗就業個案，其中涉及60歲或以上的參加人數及就業個案數目約佔總數的四分之一。與上述計劃相輔相成，勞工處亦通過「中高齡就業計劃」下的培訓津貼鼓勵僱主聘請40歲或以上人士並提供培訓，讓中高齡人士提升工作技能。

就議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）後，現答覆如下：

（一）在保障本地勞工優先就業的前提下，政府適度容許僱主申請輸入勞工，補充本港勞動力。勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

勞工處推行優化計劃時，致力保障本地勞工優先就業。優化計劃的申請僱主必須進行四星期本地招聘，以不低於當時市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合適的本地工人填補空缺。優化計劃規定，僱主在本地招聘期間經任何途徑招聘本地求職者，均不得提供遜於勞工處同意的聘用條件，亦不可向求職者附加任何年齡、性別等限制性要求。優化計劃亦規定僱主須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例二比一的規定。同時，僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工，保障本地工人的就業機會。

為進一步加強保障本地工人優先就業，勞工處已於六‍月十七日實施新措施，包括由當日起獲通過初步甄別並進行四星期本地招聘的優化計劃申請，勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料時，展示申請公司的名稱，增加本地招聘的透明度，鼓勵求職人士應徵有關職位。

勞工處會檢討優化計劃的經驗與成效，包括計劃的涵蓋範圍、運作和實施安排；促進及確保本地工人（包括年長人士）優先就業的措施；保障輸入勞工權益的措施；以及其他有關計劃的規定及事項。政府在檢討過程中會充分考慮及平衡持份者的意見，從而擬定優化計劃及後的安排。

（二）政府致力消除任何歧視觀念或行為。在就業範疇，政府鼓勵僱主依據「不論年齡，唯才是用」的原則，按照合理和劃一的甄選準則評估應徵者或僱員的工作能力。根據政府統計處曾進行的統計結果顯示，絕大多數受訪者並不認為年齡是影響僱傭方面的重要因素，反映香港就業市場年齡歧視的問題並不顯著。

政府會繼續通過宣傳及推廣平等就業機會的信息，促進和保障平等就業機會，並加強培訓和再培訓，提高不同年齡人士的就業能力。

（三）鼓勵僱主為其65歲或以上的僱員作更多強制性公積金（強積金）自願性供款的稅務優惠建議，目的是鼓勵更多年長僱員在65歲後考慮繼續留在勞動市場，既可為經濟增長作出貢獻，又可增加退休儲蓄。鑑於有意見認為此單一措施的成效不大，建議與其他銀髮措施結合，以產生協同效應，就此，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出將此項建議納入促進銀髮經濟工作組（工作組）的工作內。工作組經審視後，認為有關建議複雜化了強積金的政策目標，其就有關僱員領取自願性供款所設的限制亦令建議的效用存疑。就鼓勵長者加入勞動市場方面，工作組在今年五月二十七日公布的30項促進銀髮經濟的措施中，已提出多項有助釋放「銀色生產動力」的針對性措施，例如為後50人士推出優先培訓顧問諮詢服務、檢討「再就業津貼試行計劃」及「中高齡就業計劃」，以及加強推廣長者友善僱傭措施，政府認為應集中資源落實上述措施，以更聚焦和直接地促進年長人士就業。"
"LCQ4: Unleashing ""silver productivity""",2025-07-09 12:30,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900300.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lam Chun-sing and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 In May this year, the Government announced various measures to promote the silver economy. There are views that in terms of unleashing ""silver productivity"", the authorities should introduce more measures to help grass-roots elderly to overcome employment difficulties and improve employment conditions. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as quite a number of grass-roots elderly persons have relayed that under the existing labour importation policies, employers tend to hire younger imported workers, resulting in fewer job opportunities for the elderly, particularly for the job categories covered by the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme, whether the Government will consider tightening such scheme, for example, by setting quota ceilings for all job categories, so as to enhance employment opportunities for the elderly;

(2) as some elderly job seekers have relayed that even if they met the job requirements, some employers explicitly indicated that they refused to hire them due to their advanced age, whether the authorities will actively study the enactment of legislation to combat age discrimination in the workplace; and

(3) given that the Government proposed in 2023 to increase tax deduction for Mandatory Provident Fund voluntary contributions made by employers for their employees aged 65 or above to encourage them to make contributions for mature employees, with a view to increasing the retirement savings of the silver-haired group, and proposed in the 2024 Policy Address to put the relevant measure under the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy, of the progress of taking forward the relevant measure?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been implementing various measures to assist job seekers in securing employment. Taking account of the employment needs of older and middle-aged persons, the Government provides diversified employment support and promote elderly-friendly employment practices to encourage and assist them to re-enter or remain in the employment market, and to unleash the labour force of older persons.

 On July 15 last year, the Labour Department (LD) launched the three-year Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme to encourage persons aged 40 or above who have not been in paid work for three consecutive months or more to re-join the employment market. Each eligible participant who has worked for 12 months continuously will be provided with a re-employment allowance up to $20,000. Response to the Scheme is very favourable. As at June this year, over 45 000 participants and nearly 23 000 placements were recorded. About a quarter of the participants and placements are persons aged 60 or above. In tandem with the above Scheme, the LD, through the training subsidy of the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged, encourages employers to hire persons aged 40 or above and provide them with training to uplift the work skills of older and middle-aged persons.

 In consultation with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) On the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government suitably allows employers to apply for importation of workers to replenish the labour force in Hong Kong. The LD has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

 When implementing the ESLS, the LD is committed to safeguarding employment priority for local workers. Applicant employers of the ESLS must undertake a four-week local recruitment exercise and give priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. The ESLS requires that employers taking on local job seekers through any recruitment channels during the local recruitment period must not offer employment terms less favourable than those agreed by the LD, nor can they impose on job seekers any restrictive requirements such as age or gender. The ESLS also requires employers to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 on a continuous basis. At the same time, employers shall not displace serving local workers with imported workers. To protect the employment opportunities of local workers, employers should retrench imported workers first in the event of redundancy.

 To further strengthen the protection of employment priority for local workers, the LD implemented new measures on June 17, including displaying the names of applicant companies on the Interactive Employment Service website when publishing the job vacancies in respect of the ESLS applications which pass the initial screening and commence the four-week local recruitment process after that date to increase the transparency of local recruitment and encourage job seekers to apply for relevant jobs.

The LD will review the experience and effectiveness of the ESLS, including the Scheme's coverage, operation and implementation arrangements, measures to promote and ensure employment priority for local workers (including older persons), measures to protect the rights and benefits of imported workers, as well as other requirements and matters relating to the ESLS. The Government will take full account of and balance the views of stakeholders during the review when mapping out the future arrangements of the ESLS.

(2) The Government is committed to eliminating all forms of discriminatory ideas and behaviours. In the realm of employment, the Government encourages employers to adopt the principle of ""Count on Talent, Not Age in Employment"" when assessing the abilities of candidates or employees, and use reasonable and standardised selection criteria. According to the results of a survey conducted by the Census and Statistics Department, the vast majority of respondents did not view age as an important factor affecting employment, reflecting that age discrimination is not a major problem in Hong Kong's employment market.

 The Government will continue to promote and uphold equal employment opportunities by disseminating and advocating the message of fairness in employment, as well as strengthening training and retraining to enhance the employability of individuals across all age groups.

(3) The proposed tax initiative to employers to make more Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) voluntary contributions for their employees aged 65 or above aims to encourage more mature employees to consider staying in the labour force and continue to contribute to economic growth after reaching age 65 while increasing their retirement savings. Given that there were views on the limited effect for this standalone measure and recommendations that this measure should be combined with the other initiatives on silver economy for creating synergy, the Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address announced that this proposal would be included in the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy (Working Group). Upon review, the Working Group considered that the proposal has complicated the policy objective of MPF, and the restriction on employees receiving voluntary contributions also casts doubt on the effectiveness of the proposal. In terms of encouraging the elderly to join the labour force, the Working Group has already rolled out various targeted measures to help unleash ""silver productivity"" as part of the 30 measures for promoting silver economy announced on May 27 this year, such as accord priority to post-50s for receiving training consultation service, reviewing the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme and Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged, and stepping up the promotion of elderly-friendly employment practices. The Government considers that resources should be concentrated on the aforementioned measures to promote employment of older persons in a more focused and direct manner."
LCQ20: Enhancing clearance efficiency,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900357.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Rock Chen and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

It has been reported that serious congestion occurred at various land boundary control points (BCPs) in Hong Kong on June 21 and 22 this year, and crowd management measures had to be implemented at the Heung Yuen Wai/Liantang Control Point, the Shenzhen Bay Port and the Hong Kong Port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. On the night of June 22, Hong Kong vehicles travelling under the ""Quota-free Scheme for Hong Kong Private Cars Travelling to Guangdong via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge"" (""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme) even caused serious congestion on the Zhuhai Highway when they returned to Hong Kong. In addition, there are views that some vehicles under ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme have not travelled according to the reserved time slot, thus affecting the clearance efficiency at BCPs. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has reviewed the main reasons for the serious congestion at land BCPs during the aforesaid period (e.g. whether it was related to factors such as the end of the examination seasons of primary and secondary schools, the improvement of the weather or activities organised by shopping malls in Shenzhen); whether the Government has put in place an inter-departmental joint early warning mechanism which incorporates school calendars and daily schedules of schools in general, weather forecasts as well as information on commercial activities in Shenzhen, so as to make advance assessments and forecasts on the passenger flow at BCPs; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) as it has been reported that during the aforesaid period when crowd management was implemented at the Heung Yuen Wai/Liantang Control Point and when there were the peak hours for people returning to Hong Kong at the Shenzhen Bay Port, the authorities did not issue real-time alerts through official channels, whether the Government has reviewed the existing information dissemination mechanism; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) in order to avoid the aforesaid similar serious congestion in the future, whether the Government will consider implementing new measures, such as formulating temporary crowd management plans or deploying additional BCP personnel to enhance clearance efficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) of the number of vehicle owners who have been penalised since the implementation of the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme for failing to travel according to the reserved time slot or failing to make a reservation (set out by penalty measure, including refusing to allow their vehicles to travel to Guangdong Province, suspending their eligibility for making another reservation and revoking the relevant licences issued to them); whether the authorities have reviewed the effectiveness of the existing penalty mechanism, and whether they will consider adjusting the mechanism to further ensure that vehicles under the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme will travel according to the reserved time slot?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Transport and Logistics Bureau, a reply to the questions raised by the Hon Rock Chen is as follows:

(1) With the increasing co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong, exchanges at the community level have also intensified. We are pleased to learn that many Hong Kong residents like travelling to the Mainland during weekends or long public holidays, and are glad to learn that the number of Mainland visitors to Hong Kong is on an upward trend. The two-way travel between residents of the Mainland and Hong Kong has also brought economic benefits to both places.

During the weekend of June 21 and 22 this year, around 569 000 outbound passenger trips (Saturday) and around 586 000 inbound passenger trips (Sunday) were recorded at various land boundary control points (BCPs), of which about 80 per cent were Hong Kong residents, representing an increase of about 22 per cent and 18 per cent compared with the average numbers of outbound and inbound passenger trips during normal weekends this year.

Northbound travel has become a weekend routine for Hong Kong residents. Since travelling is very convenient and there is no need for advance planning, residents can make impromptu trips for different reasons, such as weather conditions on the day or individual preference. The reasons for the relatively higher numbers of inbound and outbound passenger trips in the aforementioned weekend as compared with normal weekends may include the end of the school examination season and improved weather conditions during the weekend.

The peak hours for outbound and inbound passenger traffic were from 9am to 3pm on Saturday, and from 4pm to midnight on Sunday, which are similar to the northbound travel pattern of Hong Kong residents at normal weekends. As for the vehicular flow, the number of outbound trips for private cars via the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macao Bridge (HZMB) on Saturday was 9 662, among which those under the ""Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles"" Scheme (the Northbound Travel Scheme) accounted for 68 per cent, while the number of inbound trips on Sunday was 9 432, which was about 25 per cent higher than the numbers of outbound and inbound trips at normal weekends this year.

It is noted that the waiting time during the peak hours of cross-boundary traffic at the HZMB Hong Kong Port and Heung Yuen Wai (HYW) BCP was longer than usual. Relevant departments at various BCPs, including the Immigration Department (ImmD), the Customs and Excise Department, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), etc. have put in place an inter-departmental co-operation mechanism to monitor the real-time situations at BCPs during different festive occasions and mega events. In view of the heavy traffic at the BCPs over the aforementioned weekend, relevant departments had immediately activated the contingency mechanism. Through close co-ordination and flexible deployment of manpower, operation of additional clearance counters and kiosks, and implementation of appropriate crowd control and traffic diversion measures to maintain order at the BCPs, congestion was alleviated in an orderly manner.

The TD has always maintained close liaison with local and cross-boundary public transport operators, and would co-ordinate with them to flexibly adjust the frequency of public transport services connecting each BCP during peak cross-boundary travel periods in order to meet the travel needs. During the above-mentioned weekend, public transport operators closely monitored changes in the number of passengers, increased the service frequency during periods of particularly high passenger demand, as well as deployed additional staff to assist passengers and maintain order at the stations, with a view to expediting the dispersal of passengers.

(2) The Government has disseminated information through various official and unofficial channels, including radio broadcasts, websites, and online media such as social media platforms, to assist residents and passengers in planning ahead and avoid making their journeys during busy periods as far as possible. Passengers may visit the ImmD's website to check the estimated waiting time of each BCP, and the TD's ""HKeMobility"" mobile application or the TD's website (hkemobility.gov.hk/en/traffic-information/live/cctv) to access the snapshots of traffic conditions at outbound and inbound vehicle clearance plazas of the HZMB Hong Kong Port. They may also browse the relevant websites and mini programmes, etc. of the Shenzhen and Zhuhai authorities to know more about the clearance status of BCPs in the Mainland.

The HKPF will continue to monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs and disseminate the latest information to the public timely through the media or social media in the event of serious congestion at individual BCP, including appealing to the public to adjust their itineraries (e.g. switching to other modes of transport or using other BCPs for boundary crossing) in order to ease passenger and vehicular flows.

Moreover, the TD's Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre operates 24 hours a day to closely monitor traffic conditions and public transport services in different areas of Hong Kong, including various BCPs and major stations, and will disseminate the latest traffic information through various channels. Members of the public can check the latest traffic news released by radio, television, and the ""HKeMobility"".

(3) Northbound travel over weekends has become a norm for Hong Kong residents, and the two-way travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong is also a future trend. We therefore need to get well-prepared, and enhance the responsiveness of relevant departments as well as the level of clearance facilitation at the BCPs in order to cope with the increasing demand for clearance services.

The departments at the BCPs will enhance the co-operation mechanism, constantly monitor the real-time situations at various BCPs, and maintain close liaison with the Mainland port authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanisms to ensure smooth operation of the BCPs.

With respect to the traffic and vehicular flow at the HZMB Hong Kong Port, the HKPF will, depending on the circumstances, deploy additional police officers to the major roads of the port for on-the-spot observation of traffic conditions, and remind drivers to comply with road markings and drive with care, with a view to ensuring road safety and smooth traffic. When the vehicles enter the clearance plaza and its maximum capacity is reached, the HKPF will also implement traffic control measures in a timely manner to maintain order on the spot.

In addition, to further increase the handling capacity of the HYW BCP, enhancement works are being carried out at its passenger departure hall. Upon completion of the works, the total number of e-Channels in the passenger departure hall will be increased from 14 to 18. As some of its traditional counters have to be closed temporarily in the course of the enhancement works, the ImmD has flexibly deployed resources to set up four temporary counters in the passenger departure hall to minimise the impact of the enhancement works. We will also explore the possibility of further increasing the number of e-Channels.

As stated above, the two-way travel between residents of the Mainland and Hong Kong is a future trend. We need to enhance the handling capacity of BCPs in order to meet the increasing passenger traffic. In particular, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is collaborating with the Shenzhen Municipal Government to press ahead with the redevelopment project of the Huanggang Port in full steam. The redeveloped new Huanggang Port will implement the co-location arrangement and the ""collaborative inspection and joint clearance"" mode to provide greater convenience for cross-boundary passengers. The new Huanggang Port will be equipped with 134 ""collaborative inspection"" automated channels and 68 traditional manual counters, representing a significant increase compared to 39 traditional e-channels and 45 traditional manual counters currently available at the Lok Ma Chau (LMC) Control Point. Its design flow is about 200 000 passenger trips per day. Compared to the LMC Control Point which now serves a daily average of about 37 000 passenger trips, it is believed that the redeveloped new Huanggang Port can meet the future demand for clearance services between the two places.

(4) As stipulated in the terms and conditions of ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"", if any participants violate the travel arrangements (including travelling without booking in advance or not travelling within the specified period), the relevant departments of the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments may refuse to allow relevant vehicles to travel to Guangdong Province via the HZMB, and may suspend their travel booking eligibility, or even revoke the relevant permits. At present, the TD regularly shares the booking information on ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"" with relevant departments at the Hong Kong Port to facilitate their daily operations at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. The TD has also been maintaining close liaison with the relevant Mainland authorities, and conducting spot checks on the cross-boundary records of vehicles under ""the Northbound Travel Scheme"", with a view to reviewing the situation of compliance with the terms and conditions."
立法會二十一題：保障本地勞工就業,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900312.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陸頌雄議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

根據行業輸入勞工計劃及補充勞工優化計劃（「優化計劃」）的一般規定，僱主須符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工的人手比例為二比一（該人手比例），而優化計劃亦規定僱主必須先進行四星期本地招聘，優先聘請合適的本地工人填補空缺。但有工友反映，有僱主利用相關政策漏洞，在向勞工處提交輸入勞工申請後，解僱本地勞工或將他們由全職轉為兼職，更有部分僱主無意招聘本地勞工。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府於上月十八日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，僱主在完成四星期本地招聘程序後，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人，自優化計劃推出至今，勞工處聯繫不獲聘用的本地工人的次數和相關僱主拒絕聘用他們的理由為何；勞工處以何標準評估僱主拒絕招聘的理由是否合理；

（二）會否主動調查僱主有否向本地求職者提出「過分要求」（即招聘門檻過高及工作量大但薪酬偏低等）；如會，勞工處已進行的調查次數和跟進措施為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）有何機制監察僱主有否嚴格執行四星期本地招聘的規定；會否要求僱主在申請優化計劃前，必須將該等職位空缺資料刊登至勞工處「互動就業服務」網站，並至少保留四星期；

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，政府已加強輸入勞工的機制。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）為保障本地勞工優先就業，優化計劃的申請僱主必須先進行四星期本地公開招聘，以不低於市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。僱主完成本地招聘程序後，勞工處會聯繫每名不獲僱主聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情，並確定僱主匯報不聘用的原因是否與事實相符及合理，從而評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人。最常見不獲聘用的原因為求職者未達入職要求，例如沒有相關工作技能及缺乏相關經驗。視乎情況，勞工處會多次聯繫每名不獲聘用的求職者，跟進面試的結果。

（二）及（三）勞工處嚴謹處理每宗優化計劃的申請，為每個申請職位進行初步甄別，審視職位空缺的聘用條件，包括職責範圍、入職和學歷要求、工作地點、每月薪酬及工作時數等，確保僱主擬提供的薪金達到每月中位工資及招聘條件合理。

通過初步甄別後，僱主須以勞工處同意的招聘條件就申請職位進行四星期本地招聘，其間勞工處會在「互動就業服務」網站刊登職位空缺資料，為有關空缺進行就業選配，並將空缺資料發布給勞工顧問委員會委員、相關職工會及培訓機構，以便他們轉介合適的本地求職人士應徵。僱主須同時在本地報章或其他招聘平台刊登招聘廣告，優化計劃規定，僱主在本地招聘期間經任何途徑招聘本地求職者，均不得提供遜於勞工處同意的聘用條件，亦不可向求職者提出任何年齡、性別等限制性要求或其他未獲勞工處同意的入職要求。

僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果並遞交招聘廣告作核對。勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會中止處理有關申請。勞工處亦會向僱主施加行政制裁，拒絕處理他們在隨後一年提交的其他申請。

（四）優化計劃規定僱主須持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例二比一的規定（人手比例規定）。全職僱員是指僱主直接僱用而每周總工作時數不少於35小時以經營相關業務的本地僱員，不包括兼職僱員、向僱主提供服務的外判商員工或自僱人士。二○二三年九月四日至二○二五年六月，勞工處拒絕29宗涉及未符合人手比例規定的輸入勞工申請。此外，每宗申請獲批的輸入勞工數目亦須符合上述的人手比例。

二○二三年九月四日至二○二五年四月期間，勞工處沒有收到有關僱主不符合人手比例規定的投訴，而二○二五年五月至六月期間則收到31宗這類投訴，勞工處正進行調查，包括巡查輸入勞工的工作地點及查核有關的僱傭紀錄。如證實僱主違反規定，會施加行政制裁，拒絕處理僱主在隨後一年提交的其他申請。

（五）及（六）二○二三年、二○二四年及二○二五年一至五月，勞工處的勞工督察分別到輸入勞工的工作地點及僱主在香港為輸入勞工提供的居所進行5695 次、5417次及2873次巡查，保障輸入勞工的僱傭權益。勞工處不會在巡查工作場所前預先通知有關場所的負責人。

由今年六月十七日起，勞工處實施一系列加強保障本地工人優先就業的新措施，包括在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴；在「互動就業服務」網站刊登優化計劃本地招聘的職位空缺資料時，展示申請公司名稱；進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合人手比例規定；以及按違規風險，要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。

為保障本地工人的就業機會，優化計劃規定僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職的本地僱員，並須持續符合人手比例規定。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。如證實僱主違反優化計劃的規定，勞工處會作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准、拒絕處理僱主其後的輸入勞工申請（禁制期最長兩年）等。"
LCQ21: Safeguarding employment of local workers,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900324.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Luk Chung-hung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

  According to the general requirements of the sector-specific labour importation schemes and the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS), employers shall fulfil a manning ratio of 2:1 for full-time local employees to imported workers (the manning ratio), and the ESLS also requires applicant employers to undertake a four-week local recruitment exercise and accord priority to employing suitable local workers to fill the job vacancies. However, some workers have reflected that some employers have taken advantage of the loopholes in the relevant policies to dismiss local workers or switch them from full-time to part-time after submitting their labour importation applications to the Labour Department (LD), and some employers even have no intention of recruiting local workers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on 18th of last month, the Government indicated that upon completion of the four-week local recruitment procedures, the LD would contact each of the local job seekers who was not employed by the employers and assess whether the employers are genuinely committed to recruiting local workers, of the number of contacts made by the LD with job seekers who were not employed since the launch of the ESLS, and the reasons for the relevant employers' refusal to employ them; the criteria adopted by the LD for assessing the validity of the employer's reasons for refusal to recruit;

(2) whether it has taken the initiative to investigate if employers have made ""excessive demands"" on local job seekers (i.e. excessively high recruitment thresholds and heavy workload but relatively low salary, etc); if so, of the number of investigations conducted by the LD and the follow-up actions taken; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) of the mechanism in place to monitor whether employers have strictly adhered to the requirement for conducing four-week local recruitment; whether employers will be required to, before applying for the ESLS, publish the job vacancies on the LD's Interactive Employment Service website and retain for at least four weeks;

(4) since 2023, (i) of the number of labour importation applications rejected by the LD due to the failure of the information submitted by the employers to meet the manning ratio; and (ii) of the number of complaints received by the LD regarding employers allegedly failing to continuously meet the manning ratio, the follow-up actions and the corresponding penalties;

(5) since 2023, of the respective numbers of (a) surprise and (b) non-surprise inspections conducted by the LD (i) at workplaces with imported workers, and (ii) cases detected and follow-up actions taken in respect of non-compliance with the manning ratio requirement, with a breakdown as set out in the table below; and

(6) of the measures in place to combat the non-compliant acts under various labour importation schemes in order to prevent abuse of the labour importation policy; whether employers will be required to report to the LD the number, name, working hour, wage and so on of their local employees and imported workers on a monthly basis after their labour importation applications have been approved; if so, of the details; if not, not reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government has enhanced the mechanism for importation of labour. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023, to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

  The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) To safeguard the employment priority for local workers, applicant employers of the ESLS must undertake a four-week local open recruitment and accord priority to employing qualified local workers to fill the vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. Upon employers' completion of the local recruitment procedures, the LD will contact each of the unsuccessful local job seekers to verify the interview details and confirm if the reasons for not employing the job seekers as reported by the employers are consistent with the facts and reasonable, so as to assess whether the employers have sincerity in recruiting local workers. The most common reason for job seekers not being employed is failing to meet the entry requirements, such as not having relevant work skills and lacking relevant experience. Depending on the circumstances, the LD will contact each unsuccessful job seeker several times to follow up on the interview results.

(2) and (3) The LD stringently processes each application under the ESLS, and conducts initial screening for each applied post and reviews the employment terms, including the scope of duties, entry and academic requirements, work locations, monthly salary and hours of work, to ensure that the salary offered by an employer meets the median monthly wage and the recruitment terms are reasonable.

  After passing the initial screening, employers shall adopt the recruitment terms as agreed by the LD and undergo four-week local recruitment. During this period, the LD will publish the job vacancies on the Interactive Employment Service website, conduct job matching for relevant vacancies and disseminate the vacancy information to members of the Labour Advisory Board, relevant trade unions and training institutions to facilitate their referrals of suitable local job seekers for application. Employers shall in parallel place recruitment advertisements in local newspaper(s) or on other recruitment platform(s). The ESLS requires that employers taking on local job seekers through any recruitment channels during the local recruitment period must not offer employment terms less favourable than those agreed by the LD, nor can they impose on job seekers any restrictive requirements such as age or gender, or other entry requirements not approved by the LD.

  Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results and submit the recruitment advertisements to the LD for verification. The LD will contact each of the local job seekers who is not employed to verify the interview details. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable grounds, the LD will terminate the processing of the relevant application. The LD will also impose administrative sanction on the employer and refuse to process any other application(s) submitted by the concerned employer in the following year.

(4) The ESLS requires relevant employers to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 (manning ratio requirement) on a continuous basis. Full-time employees refer to local employees who are directly employed by an employer and work not less than 35 hours per week for operating the relevant business, excluding part-time staff, staff of subcontractors or self-employed persons providing services to the employer. From September 4, 2023, to June 2025, the LD refused 29 applications for labour importation that failed to meet the manning ratio requirement. In addition, the number of imported workers approved for each application must also comply with the manning ratio mentioned above.

  From September 4, 2023, to April 2025, the LD did not receive any complaint against employers for non-compliance with the manning ratio requirement. As for the 31 related complaints received between May and June 2025, the LD is conducting investigation, including inspecting the workplaces of imported workers and verifying relevant employment records. If violation of the requirement is substantiated, the LD will impose administrative sanction and refuse to process other application(s) submitted by the employer in the following year.

(5) and (6) In 2023, 2024 and from January to May 2025, Labour Inspectors of the LD conducted 5 695, 5 417 and 2 873 inspections respectively to workplaces of imported workers and imported workers' accommodation provided by employers in Hong Kong to protect the employment rights of imported workers. The LD will not give prior notice to the responsible persons of relevant premises before conducting workplace inspections.

  Since June 17 this year, the LD has implemented a series of new measures to strengthen the protection of the employment priority for local workers, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers for suspected breaches of the requirements of the ESLS, displaying the names of applicant companies when publishing job vacancies on the Interactive Employment Service website, launching a special inspection campaign to check whether establishments employing imported workers have continuously met the manning ratio requirement, and requiring employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach.

  To safeguard the employment priority for local workers, the ESLS requires employers not to displace local workers with imported workers and meet the manning ratio requirement on a continuous basis. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. If there is evidence substantiating violation of the requirement of the ESLS, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the employers, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted and refusal to process other applications submitted by the employers (debarment period up to two years), etc."
立法會二十題：提升通關效率,2025-07-09 12:20,2025-07-09 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900358.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上陳仲尼議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據報本年六月二十一日及二十二日期間，本港各陸路口岸出現嚴重擠塞，香園圍／蓮塘口岸、深圳灣口岸及港珠澳大橋香港口岸須實施人潮管制措施，而六月二十二日晚透過「港珠澳大橋港車北上不設配額計劃」（「港車北上」計劃）出行的港車回港時更造成珠海公路嚴重擠塞。此外，有意見認為「港車北上」計劃部分車輛未有按照預約時段出行，影響口岸的通關效率。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否檢視上述期間陸路口岸嚴重擠塞的主要原因為何（例如是否與中小學考試季節完結、天氣轉好或有深圳商場舉辦活動等因素有關）；政府有否設立跨部門聯合預警機制，結合一般學校的校曆和日程、天氣預報及深圳商業活動資訊，提前評估及預測口岸人流；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）據報上述期間香園圍／蓮塘口岸實施人潮管制及深圳灣口岸出現回港人潮高峰時，當局並無透過官方渠道發布實時提示，政府有否檢討現有的資訊發布機制；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

答覆：

主席：

就陳仲尼議員的提問，經諮詢運輸及物流局後，現回覆如下：

（一）隨着內地與香港合作日益頻繁，民間交流也更見緊密。我們樂見不少港人喜歡在周末或長假期期間到內地旅遊，也喜聞內地訪港旅客人數呈上升趨勢，內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴亦帶動兩地經濟效益。

​今年六月二十一日及二十二日的周末，在各陸路口岸錄得約569 000出境人次（星期六）和約586 000入境人次（星期日），當中約八成為港人，與今年一般周末的平均出境人次及入境人次相比分別多約22%及18%。

港人周末北上已成習慣，加上出行十分便利，亦無須預先計劃行程，市民可因應不同原因，以及視乎當日天氣或個人喜好即興出行。上述周末出入境人數較一般周末為多，估計原因包括可能與學校考試季節完結及周末天氣轉好有關。

出境及入境的繁忙時段分別為星期六上午九時至下午三時，以及星期日下午四時至午夜十二時，與一般周末港人北上的出行習慣相若。至於車流方面，星期六經港珠澳大橋出境的私家車車次為9 662，當中「港車北上」佔68%，而於星期日回港的車次則為9 432，與今年一般周末的出入境車次相比多約25%。

我們留意到港珠澳大橋香港口岸及香園圍管制站在出入境最繁忙的數小時期間，輪候時間較一般長。各口岸相關部門包括入境事務處（入境處）、香港海關、警務處及運輸署等，已備有跨部門合作機制，就不同節日及大型活動，實時監察口岸情況。因應上述周末的口岸繁忙情況，口岸部門已即時啓動應變機制，透過緊密協調，靈活調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱和通道，並採取適當人流管控及交通疏導措施，以維持口岸秩序，讓擠塞情況得以有序疏導。

運輸署一向與本地和跨境公共運輸服務營辦商保持緊密聯繫，並會協調營辦商因應過境高峰期而彈性調整連接各陸路口岸的公共交通服務班次，以應付期間的交通需求。在上述周末，各公共交通營辦商一直密切留意口岸繁忙時段的旅客數量的變化，在乘客需求特別殷切的時段加密班次，並已加派人手協助乘客和維持車站秩序，以加快疏導旅客。

（二）政府已透過不同官方及非官方的渠道，包括電台廣播、網頁及社交平台等線上媒體發布資訊，協助市民及旅客預早計劃行程，盡量避免在繁忙時間過關。其中，市民可瀏覽入境處網頁，查看各邊境管制站的估計輪候過關狀況，以及運輸署的流動應用程式「香港出行易」，或運輸署網頁 （hkemobility.gov.hk/tc/traffic-information/live/cctv），查閱大橋香港口岸出境及入境客車通關廣場的交通快拍。市民亦可以瀏覽深圳和珠海當局相關網頁和小程式等，同時了解內地方的口岸通關狀態。

警方會繼續實時監察各口岸，在個別口岸出現嚴重擠塞的時候，適時透過媒體或社交媒體向市民發布最新信息，包括呼籲市民更改行程（如轉乘其他交通公具或經其他口岸出入境等），以疏導人流車流。

此外，運輸署的緊急事故交通協調中心每日24小時運作，密切監察全港各區，包括各口岸及主要車站的交通情況及公共運輸服務，並透過不同渠道發放最新交通資訊。市民可留意電台、電視台及「香港出行易」發放的最新交通消息。

（三）港人周末北上已成常態，而內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴亦是未來趨勢，因此我們需要作好準備，提升口岸部門的應對能力及口岸通關便利化水平，以應對不斷上升的通關需求。

口岸部門會強化合作機制，時刻監察各管制站的實時情況，與內地口岸部門透過已建立的口岸熱線及即時通報機制保持緊密聯繫，確保口岸運作暢通。

就有關港珠澳大橋香港口岸的交通及車流，警方會因應情況加派警員到口岸主要幹道實地觀察交通情況，提醒駕駛者遵守道路標記、小心駕駛，確保行車安全及道路暢通。當車輛駛至通關廣場並出現飽和情況時，警方亦會適時實施交通管制措施，以維持現場秩序。

此外，為進一步提升香園圍管制站的通關能力，管制站離境大堂正進行優化工程，工程完成後離境大堂的e-道會由原來的14條增加至18條。優化工程期間，離境大堂部分櫃枱需暫停使用，入境處因此靈活調配資源，於離境大堂增設四個臨時櫃枱，務求將優化工程的影響減至最低。我們會研究進一步增加e-道數目。

正如前文所述，內地與香港人民的雙向奔赴是未來趨勢，我們需要提升口岸通關能力，以應對持續增長的旅客流量。其中，特區政府正與深圳市政府全力推進皇崗口岸重建項目。重建後的新皇崗口岸會採用「一地兩檢」安排及「合作查驗、一次放行」通關模式，為跨境旅客提供更大便利。新皇崗口岸將設置134條「合作查驗」自助通道及68個傳統人工櫃枱，較現時落馬洲口岸的39條傳統e-道及45個傳統人工櫃枱配置大為提升，其設計通關流量約為每日20萬人次。對比現時每天平均約37 000人次進出的落馬洲口岸，重建後的新皇崗口岸相信可應付兩地未來的通關需求。

（四）「港車北上」的申請條款及條件中列明，如有關參加者違反出行安排（包括沒有事先預約或未有在指定時間內出行），粵港政府相關部門可拒絕讓有關車輛經大橋前往廣東省，並可能暫停其預約出行的資格，甚或撤銷其獲發的相關牌證。現時，運輸署定期把「港車北上」預約出行的資料傳送予口岸部門，以配合部門於大橋香港口岸的日常工作。運輸署亦一直與內地相關部門保持緊密聯繫，不時抽查「港車北上」車輛的過境紀錄以檢視遵守條款及條件的情況。"

問題：

為協助按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）下的業主應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要，香港按證保險有限公司（按證保險公司）於去年八月宣布一項新安排，合資格業主可按個別情況獲豁免按保計劃下的業主自住要求，並獲批准申請將物業出租，惟須符合下述三項條件之一：（i）業主家庭將有新生嬰兒或領養兒童，導致住屋要求改變；（ii）業主失業，因而需要更具彈性的住屋或財務安排；或（iii）業主有其他特別需要出租物業，而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月。此外，申請獲得批准的業主須承諾在豁免生效期間，業主及其同為按保計劃下債務人的配偶或同居伴侶不會在香港購入其他住宅物業。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉按證保險公司分別根據條件（i）、（ii）及（iii）接獲及批准了多少宗豁免業主自住要求的申請；及

（二）會否考慮優化現行安排，進一步協助按保計劃下有意另覓居所的業主，豁免他們在香港購入其他住宅物業的限制，為期最多12個月，讓他們在購入新物業後，有時間處理按保計劃下的物業；如否，原因為何

答覆：

主席：

按揭保險計劃（按保計劃）由香港按證保險有限公司﹙按證保險公司）經營，以協助市民在香港安居置業。按證保險公司於二○二四年八月在按保計劃下設立新安排，按個別情況考慮批准合資格業主將自住的物業出租，以協助他們應付因個人或家庭處境轉變帶來的特別需要（新安排）。

就問題的兩個部分，經諮詢按證保險公司後，現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年六月底，按證保險公司就新安排共收到約1 800宗申請。當中共有1 697宗申請獲批，其餘申請為不符合申請條件而被拒絕的個案或正在處理的申請。獲批申請的分類如下：




申請原因
宗數


業主家庭將有新生嬰兒或領養兒童，導致住屋要求改變
336
			（20%）


業主失業，因而需要更具彈性的住屋或財務安排
41
			（2%）


業主有其他特別需要出租物業，而本身在相關物業已自住最少12個月
1 320
			（78%）


總數
1 697
			（100%）




（二）由於按保計劃旨在促進市民安居置業，業主自住要求仍然是該計劃的主要合資格準則。新安排屬特殊措施，以協助有特別需要人士。事實上，按保計劃本質上屬保險產品，信貸風險仍是其主要考慮因素之一。如果在按保計劃下允許獲准出租物業的業主在未出售原有物業的情況下購入其他住宅物業，相關業主很可能需要在原有的高成數按揭貸款之外承擔更多融資負債。這將會為按保計劃帶來額外的信貸風險。

新安排推行接近一年，運作暢順，並為有特別需要的業主提供實質協助。按證保險公司暫無計劃調整新安排，未來會不時根據市場情況檢視按保計劃。"
LCQ8: Arrangement for approving property lettings under Mortgage Insurance Programme,2025-07-09 12:15,2025-07-09 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070800733.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Louis Loong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

 In order to help homeowners under the Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances, the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMC) announced in August last year a new arrangement, in which a waiver of the owner occupancy requirement under MIP will be granted, on a case-by-case basis, to an eligible homeowner applying for renting out the property subject to the fulfilment of one of the following three conditions: (i) the homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s) or adopting child(ren), resulting in a change in housing needs; (ii) the homeowner has become unemployed and requires more flexible housing or financial arrangements; or (iii) the homeowner has other special needs to rent out the property, and has been residing in the relevant property for not less than 12 months. In addition, homeowners whose applications are approved will be subject to undertakings that so long as the waiver is in effect, they or their spouses or cohabitants who are also obligors under the MIP should not purchase any additional residential properties in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the respective numbers of applications received and approved for waiver of the owner occupancy requirement by HKMC on the basis of the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii); and

(2) whether consideration will be given to the enhancement of the existing arrangement to provide further assistance to homeowners under MIP who wish to seek alternative accommodation by waiving their restriction on purchasing additional residential properties in Hong Kong for a period of up to 12 months, so as to give them a window of time to dispose of their properties under MIP upon acquisition of new properties; if not, of the reason for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Mortgage Insurance Programme (MIP) is administered by the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI) for promoting home ownership in Hong Kong. In August 2024, the HKMCI put in place a new arrangement under the MIP to approve on a case-by-case basis eligible homeowners' applications for renting out their self-occupied properties, so as to help them meet their special needs arising from changes in personal or family circumstances (new arrangement).

 After consulting the HKMCI, our reply to the two parts of the question is as follows:

(1) As of end-June 2025, the HKMCI has received about 1 800 applications for the new arrangement. Among them, 1 697 applications were approved, while the remaining applications were either rejected for not meeting the eligibility requirements or are under processing. The breakdowns of the applications approved are as follows:




Reason for application
Number


The homeowner's family is expecting newborn(s) or
			adopting child(ren), resulting in a change in housing needs
336
			(20%)


The homeowner has become unemployed and requires more
			flexible housing or financial arrangements
41
			(2%)


The homeowner has other special needs to rent out his/her property, and has been residing in the relevant property for
			not less than 12 months
1 320
			(78%)


Total
1 697
			(100%)




(2) As the aim of the MIP is to promote home ownership, the owner occupancy requirement remains a key eligibility criterion of the MIP. The new arrangement is an exceptional measure that seeks to assist those with special needs. In fact, the MIP by nature is an insurance product, with credit risk being one of the key factors of consideration. If homeowners who have been given consent to rent out their properties under the MIP are allowed to purchase additional residential properties without having sold their existing ones, it is likely for the respective homeowners to take on extra financing liabilities on top of their current high loan-to-value ratio mortgage loans. This will bring additional credit risk to the MIP.

 The new arrangement has been launched for around one year and operating smoothly, offering substantial assistance to homeowners with special needs. The HKMCI has no plan to make changes to the new arrangement at the moment, and will keep the MIP under review from time to time in the light of the market circumstances."
立法會十四題：海洋公園登山纜車,2025-07-09 12:00,2025-07-09 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900337.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上田北辰議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

根據海洋公園公司的資料，二○二三至二四年度海洋公園的總入場人次多達314萬，而據悉園內可讓搭乘遊客欣賞沿途景色的登山纜車極受歡迎。然而，本人近日收到不少市民反映，雖然該園設有兩組來回、合共四線的登山纜車，但園方在大部分周末及公眾假期僅開放其中一組共兩線供遊客使用，導致輪候纜車時間最少半個小時，大大影響遊客的體驗及對香港觀感。本人得悉纜車操作員需具備高空拯救技能及考取牌照，園方因人力資源所限，以致未能在全年所有周末及公眾假期（約120天）全面開放四線登山纜車服務。就此，政府可否告知本會，是否知悉：

（一）園方有否評估在全年所有周末及公眾假期（共約120天），開放所有登山纜車線服務所需的額外人手為何；及

（二）園方會否考慮從內地或其他地區招聘具經驗的纜車操作員，以應付日益增加的遊客需求；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

海洋公園（公園）的登山纜車是公園的標誌性設施，多年來為訪客提供獨特的遊樂體驗。現時公園共設兩組纜車，每組包括登山和下山路線各一，車程每程約13分鐘，每組每小時最多接載4 000名訪客。除登山纜車外，在二○○九年九月投入服務的海洋列車（列車）亦為訪客提供登山和下山的另一選擇。列車車程每程約四分鐘，每小時可運載高達一萬名訪客。由於列車能同時接載更多訪客，而每程時間亦較短，可為訪客提供更快捷往返兩個園區的服務，因此列車現時是往返公園山下及山上園區的主要交通工具。登山纜車則已逐漸成為園內的景點體驗設施，是公園最受歡迎的遊樂體驗設施之一。

就田北辰議員的提問，經諮詢公園，現回覆如下：

公園一直根據《架空纜車（安全）條例》（第211章）操作及保養纜車，以確保纜車服務的安全及可靠程度達至法例要求。除了每天進行例行機件檢查及運作測試，纜車系統須經多項定期檢查及預防性維修保養，例如纜塔頂滑輪組維修、車廂及後備發電機組檢查及保養等，方可運載乘客。為了確保纜車系統安全運作，纜車操作員及纜車控制員須持有由政府機電工程署發出的相關牌照，以確保他們具備所需的技能、專業知識和資歷。有意於公園考取纜車操作員牌照的人士須於訓練期間，在持牌控制員及操作員的指導下接受纜車系統日常運作、救援、維修保養、於纜車塔頂工作等一系列的訓練，並累積最少一年的在職經驗，才符合資格考取相關牌照，考獲牌照後仍須在纜車控制員的監督下方可操作纜車。而有意於公園考取纜車控制員牌照的人士則須先取得纜車操作員牌照，並在其後累積最少一年的實際經驗，同時具備執行大型部件更換和快速故障處理的能力，才符合資格考取相關牌照。

公園的纜車團隊現時共有七名纜車操作員及九名纜車控制員。在二○二四／二五財政年度（註），公園為訪客提供342日纜車服務，當中56日提供兩組纜車服務，其餘日子則提供一組纜車服務。公園現時另有九名在職員工正接受培訓和考取專業資格。倘若公園全年無間斷營運纜車，並於所有週末及公眾假期共約120日提供兩組纜車服務（天氣不許可或更換纜索等大型工程除外），公園需額外物色及增聘16名合適的新員工，讓他們接受培訓，以及累積所須的在職經驗後考取相關牌照。

為了向訪客提供優質的遊樂體驗，在纜車操作方面，公園一直積極透過內部培訓及對外招募增加人手。除了刊登網上招聘廣告，公園亦定期舉辦招聘日，為有意加入的應徵者提供即場面試，並向獲取錄的員工提供入職獎金、高空工作律貼、救援津貼、生日假期、工作周年假期等福利，務求招募更多合適人手投入相關工作。然而，纜車操作及維修的工作性質比較專門，而過去員工流失率亦高，公園已察悉難在本地勞工市場招聘有意入行的合適入才。有見及此，除了繼續積極於本地進行招聘工作外，公園自二○二四年九月起透過勞工處的「補充勞工優化計劃」，從內地招聘具三年以上纜車相關經驗的技術人員。上述九位現時正接受公園纜車系統培訓和考取專業資格的在職員工中，四位是透過計劃從內地招募的技術人員。

公園一直按恰當運用資源的原則，考慮不同因素，包括當天是平日或假期、天氣情況、園內推廣活動、特備節目地點及時間等，以安排每天的纜車服務應付預測的入場人數。

註：公園的財政年度由每年的七月一日至來年的六月三十日。在二○二四／二五財政年度，因休園日公園共12日沒有開放。另外，由於需要進行纜車維修保養及受颱風影響，該年度公園另有11日並沒有提供纜車服務。"
LCQ14: Ocean Park Cable Car,2025-07-09 12:00,2025-07-09 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900349.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Michael Tien and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

According to information from the Ocean Park Corporation, the total visitor numbers of Ocean Park (OP) in 2023-24 reached 3.14 million. It is learnt that the Cable Car is an immensely popular attraction that offers visitors the opportunity to relish scenic views during their journey. However, quite a number of members of the public have recently relayed to me that while the OP Cable Car is a two-lane ropeway system comprising two sets of round-trip cable cars with a total of four lanes, the OP only operates one set of two-lane ropeway for visitors on most weekends and public holidays, and as a result the waiting time for cable cars is at least half an hour, which has significantly undermined visitors' experience and their image of Hong Kong. I have learnt that as cable car operators are required to have high-angle rescue skills and obtain a licence, the OP is unable to put all four cable car lanes into full operation on all weekends and public holidays throughout the year (approximately 120 days) due to limited manpower resources. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council whether it knows:

(1) whether the OP has assessed the additional manpower required to operate all the cable car lanes on all weekends and public holidays throughout the year (approximately a total of 120 days); and

(2) whether the OP will consider recruiting experienced cable car operators from the Mainland or other regions to cope with the growing visitor demand; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Cable Car at Ocean Park (OP) is an iconic attraction of the OP. For many years, it has been providing visitors with a unique recreational experience. The OP has two sets of cable car ropeways, each comprising an ascent route and a descent route. Each one-way ride takes about 13 minutes and each set of ropeway is capable of transporting up to 4 000 visitors per hour. Apart from the Cable Car, the Ocean Express (OE), a train launched in September 2009, provides an alternative means for travelling between the lower and upper parks of the OP, carrying up to 10 000 passengers per hour and taking about 4 minutes for each one-way ride. As the OE has a higher passenger capacity and shorter travel time, it has become the primary mode of transportation offering quicker travelling for visitors between the OP's lower and upper parks. On the other hand, the Cable Car has gradually turned into an attraction to enrich visitor experience and is one of the most popular facilities of the OP.

In consultation with the OP, the reply to the question raised by the Hon Michael Tien is as follows:

The OP has been operating and maintaining the cable cars in accordance with the Aerial Ropeways (Safety) Ordinance (Cap 211) to ensure the safety and reliability of the cable car service in compliance with the statutory requirements. In addition to daily routine mechanical inspections and operational testing, the cable car system has to undergo a number of regular inspections and preventive maintenance (e.g. sheave maintenance at the top of the cable car trestles, inspection and maintenance of the cabins and back-up power generator, etc.) before it is deemed suitable for passenger service. To ensure safe operation of the cable car system, cable car operators and controllers are required to hold relevant licences issued by the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department to ensure that they possess the necessary skills, professional knowledge and qualifications. Prospective cable car operators who wish to apply for the relevant licence at the OP have to undergo a series of training on the cable car system's daily operation, rescue, repair and maintenance, work on cable car trestles under the guidance of licensed controllers and operators during the training period, and accumulate at least one year of on-the-job experience, in order to be eligible for applying the licence. After obtaining the licence, they can only operate the cable car under the supervision of a cable car controller. Those who intend to obtain a cable car controller licence at the OP have to first acquire a cable car operator licence, accumulate at least one year of practical experience thereafter, and demonstrate the ability to perform large-scale component replacement and rapid fault handling before they are qualified to apply for the relevant licence.

The OP's cable car team currently consists of seven operators and nine controllers. In its 2024/25 financial year (Note), the OP provided visitors with 342 days of cable car service, including dual-ropeway service for 56 days and single-ropeway service for the remaining days. Currently, nine existing staff members of the OP are undergoing training and obtaining professional qualifications. If the OP were to operate the cable car continuously throughout the year and provide dual-ropeway cable car service on all weekends and public holidays for a total of about 120 days (except for extreme weather or major works such as cable replacement, etc.), the OP would need to identify and recruit an additional 16 new staff members to undergo training and accumulate the necessary on-the-job experience for applying for the relevant licences.

To provide visitors with quality recreational experience, the OP has been actively seeking to increase the manpower of its cable car operations through internal training as well as external recruitment. Apart from online job advertisement, the OP organises recruitment days on a regular basis and offers on-site interview opportunities for prospective candidates. Successful candidates are provided with benefits such as new joiner bonus, work-at-height allowance, rescue allowance, birthday leave, anniversary leave, etc, in order to recruit more suitable candidates to join the relevant job. However, as the job nature of cable car operations and maintenance are relatively specialised and the turnover rate is high, the OP finds it challenging to recruit suitable candidates from the local labour market. In light of this, apart from the continuing active local recruitment, the OP has been recruiting technical staff with at least three years of cable car-related experience from the Mainland since September 2024 under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme of the Labour Department. Of the nine existing staff members who are currently receiving training and acquiring professional qualifications, four were recruited from the Mainland through the Scheme.

As a practice, in determining the cable car service to be provided to cater for the projected number of visitors each day, the OP will abide by the principle of proper utilisation of resources and take into account various factors, including whether the day is a weekday or a holiday, weather conditions, in-park promotional activities, and the location and schedule of special events, etc.

Note: The OP's financial year (FY) starts on every July 1 and ends on June 30 of the following year. In FY 2024/25, the park was closed for 12 days due to its dark day arrangement. And, owing to cable car maintenance and typhoon, the cable car service was suspended for another 11 days."

問題：

為支援長者就業，勞工處推行「中高齡就業計劃」（該計劃），向僱主發放在職培訓津貼，鼓勵僱主聘用年滿40歲或以上的失業求職人士。關於支援中高齡人士就業，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年符合參加該計劃資格的就業個案所涉及的僱主數目為何；

（二）會否就該計劃訂立績效指標，例如分別設定40歲至59‍歲、60歲至64歲和65歲或以上人士佔總勞動人口參與率的目標，並適時檢視該計劃在推動中高齡求職人士就業方面的成效；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

答覆：

主席：

勞工處推行「中高齡就業計劃」，鼓勵僱主聘請40歲或以上人士並提供在職培訓。僱主聘用每名60歲或以上失業或已離開職場的求職人士，並為他們提供在職培訓，可獲發每月最高5,000元的在職培訓津貼，為期六至12個月；而聘用每名40歲至59歲失業求職人士的最高在職培訓津貼金額則為每月4,000元，為期三至六個月。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二四年，「中高齡就業計劃」每年分別錄得2260宗、3340宗、2707宗、3873宗及4443宗合資格就業個案，涉及937名、1266名、1169名、1420名及1559名僱主。

（二）及（三）勞工處致力提供多元化的就業服務，促進中高齡人士就業。勞工處的十所就業中心為中高齡人士提供就業支援及專項服務，包括優先就業轉介服務和就業講座。中心的就業主任亦為他們提供個人化的就業諮詢、求職配對服務，以及培訓／再培訓課程的資料。此外，勞工處「互動就業服務」網站已設立「年長求職人士專頁」、「兼職職位專頁」，方便中高齡人士獲取最新就業資訊和尋找合適空缺。

為配合政府「促進銀髮經濟工作組」釋放「銀色生產動力」的目標，勞工處二○二五年將會舉辦約60場適合中高齡人士的大型或地區性專題招聘會，較去年的場次增加一倍。中高齡求職人士在招聘會可即場申請職位及面試，加快求職過程。

勞工處二○二四年七月十五日推出為期三年的「再就業津貼試行計劃」（再就業計劃），鼓勵連續三個月或以上沒有從事任何獲酬工作的40歲或以上人士投入就業市場。截至二○二五年六月，再就業計劃已錄得超過45000名參加者及接近23000宗就業個案，遠超原定在推行計劃三年期間可惠及6 000名就業人士的目標。其中，涉及60歲或以上的參加人數及就業個案數目約佔總數的四分之一。勞工處歡迎聘請再就業計劃參加者的僱主同時參加「中高齡就業計劃」。

勞工處將於二○二六年第一季就再就業計劃進行中期檢討，配合「中高齡就業計劃」，探討進一步促進中高齡人士就業的措施。

由於就業個案的數目受經濟、勞工市場及求職人士個人情況等因素影響，為勞動人口參與率制定關鍵績效指標並不合適。

（四）政府一直鼓勵僱主「不論年齡、唯才是用」，並按企業的情況採納長者友善僱傭措施，例如延長僱員的工作年齡、提供靈活的工作安排，以及締造適合長者工作的環境等，讓更多年長人士繼續或再就業。

勞工處會繼續進行宣傳推廣，並推行就業計劃，鼓勵僱主聘用中高齡人士。由於企業聘用員工的考慮及情況不同，政府目前沒有計劃以立法方式規管企業僱用長者員工。"

Question:

 To support the employment of elderly persons, the Labour Department has implemented the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged (EPEM) to provide employers with on-the-job training allowance to encourage them to engage unemployed job seekers aged 40 or above. On supporting the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of employers involved in the placements eligible for joining the EPEM in the past five years;

(2) whether it will formulate performance indicators for the EPEM, such as setting separate targets for the participation rates of persons aged 40 to 59, 60 to 64 and 65 or above in the total labour force, and review in a timely manner the effectiveness of the EPEM in promoting the employment of elderly and middle-aged job seekers; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it will allocate additional resources to enhance the existing measures to support the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons and provide targeted employment support, including organising different types of thematic job fairs (e.g. job fairs on part-time jobs specially designed for elderly and middle-aged persons), enhancing employment training for elderly persons, as well as providing personalised employment counselling and job-matching services, thereby assisting elderly and middle-aged persons in re-‍entering the workforce in a holistic manner; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

Reply:

President,

 The Labour Department (LD) implements the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged (EPEM) to encourage employers to hire persons aged 40 or above, and provide them with on-the-job training (OJT). Employers engaging job seekers aged 60 or above who are unemployed or have left the workforce and providing them with OJT will receive a maximum OJT allowance of $5,000 per month per employee for six to 12 months; while engaging unemployed job seekers aged 40 to 59 will receive a maximum OJT allowance of $4,000 per month per employee for three to six months.

 In response to the Member's question, the reply is provided as follows:

(1) From 2020 to 2024, the EPEM recorded respectively 2260, 3340, 2707, 3873 and 4443 eligible placements in each year, involving 937, 1266, 1169, 1420 and 1559 employers.

(2) and (3) The LD is committed to providing diversified employment services to promote the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons. The ten job centres of the LD provides elderly and middle-aged persons with employment support and dedicated services, including priority job referral service, employment briefings. Employment officers of the centres also provide personalised employment advisory and job matching services, as well as information on training/re-training courses to them. Moreover, the LD has set up the Dedicated Webpage for Elderly Job Seekers and the Dedicated Webpage on Part-time Jobs on the Interactive Employment Service website, so as to facilitate elderly and middle-aged persons to obtain the latest employment information and search for suitable vacancies.

 To tie in with the target of unleashing ""silver productivity"" put forth by the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy, the LD will stage about 60 large-scale or district-based thematic job fairs suitable for elderly and middle-aged persons in 2025, doubling the number of fairs compared to last year. Elderly and middle-aged job seekers can submit job applications and attend interviews on the spot to expedite the job seeking process.

 The LD launched the three-year Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme (REA Scheme) on July 15, 2024 to encourage persons aged 40 or above, who have not been in paid work for three consecutive months or more, to join the employment market. As at June 2025, over 45000 participants and nearly 23000 placements were recorded, far exceeding the original target of benefiting 6000 employed persons during the three-year implementation period. Of which, about one quarter of the participants and placements involved persons aged 60 or above. The LD welcomes employers taking on the participants of the REA Scheme to join the EPEM.

 The LD will conduct a mid-term review on the REA Scheme in the first quarter of 2026, along with the EPEM, to explore further measures to encourage the employment of elderly and middle-aged persons.

 As the number of placements may be affected by various factors such as the economy, labour market situation and the personal circumstances of job seekers, it is inappropriate to set key performance indicators for the labour force participation rate.

(4) The Government has been encouraging employers to follow the principle of ""Count on Talent, Not Age in Employment"" and, having regard to the individual circumstances of their enterprises, to adopt elderly-friendly employment practices such as extending the working life of employees, providing flexible work arrangements, fostering an environment conducive to elderly employment, so as to facilitate more older persons to stay in or rejoin the labour market.

 The LD will continue to conduct publicity and promotional activities as well as implement employment programmes to encourage employers to hire elderly and middle-aged persons. Owing to the varied considerations and circumstances of enterprises in recruiting staff, the Government currently has no plan to regulate the employment of older employees through legislation."
立法會十五題：國際調解院,2025-07-09 11:45,2025-07-09 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900342.htm,"以下是今日（七月九日）在立法會會議上林健鋒議員的提問和署理律政司司長張國鈞博士的書面答覆：

問題：

在國家的支持下，國際調解院的總部正式落戶香港，並預計於本年年底或明年年初投入運作。此外，33個國家於本年五月三十日簽署《關於建立國際調解院的公約》。有意見認為由於國際調解院是首個把總部設在香港的政府間國際組織，將進一步加強香港作為「亞太區主要國際法律及爭議解決服務中心」的定位。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否估算國際調解院將為香港帶來的效益，或訂立成效指標（例如新增調解員、翻譯員和研究員等崗位的數量，以及新進駐的國際組織、非政府機構和學術機構的數量）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮作出相關估算和訂立成效指標；

（二）是否知悉國際調解院有否已制訂調解員的具體選拔條件，以及相關指引和審查機制，以保證調解員可提供具合理專業水平的調解服務；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及何時完成制訂；及

（三）據報所有國家，不限於簽約國，均能使用國際調解院的服務，但有意見認為由於法律具有高度區域性（即不同司法管轄區使用不同法律體系和制度），爭議雙方對法理的理解不同，令他們期望調解服務可達致的成果可能大相徑庭，國際調解院總部會否訂立協調政策，以保障其調解服務可達致來自不同司法管轄區的爭議方均感到滿意的合理水平？

答覆：

主席︰

就林健鋒議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（三）國際調解院落戶香港，有助吸引世界各地人士來港以調解及其他方式解決爭議，加強香港作為國際法律及爭議解決服務中心的地位。國際調解院落戶香港更可吸引更多國際組織、非政府組織和學術機構進駐，進一步鞏固香港的國際地位和知名度。預期為香港帶來正面的經濟效益。國際調解院的落戶會為香港創造更多就業機會，如調解員、翻譯員、研究員和行政人員等，並吸引國際法律專業人士和學者來港，有助推動法律實務、研究和國際司法合作的發展，加強香港的國際法律網絡。座落在灣仔的國際調解院總部，將不但促進香港的國際法律和爭議解決服務發展，而且吸引更多國際會議和展覽等相關活動在香港舉行，繼而促進酒店、餐飲和運輸物流等其他行業的發展。

國際調解院要待《關於建立國際調解院的公約》通過、簽署和生效後才會正式成立，而其總部才得以正式落戶香港特區。國際調解院尚未開始運作，現階段未能提供具體詳情。正如其他政府間國際組織，國際調解院將會是獨立的國際組織，其運作政策和決定（包是否或如何訂立成效指標或協調政策），會由國際調解院自行安排和訂立。

（二）《關於建立國際調解院的公約》第四章（第十九至二十三條）規定了國際調解院的調解員名單的具體事宜，包括調解員的指派，調解員的資質和任期等。《公約》條文請見www.international-mediation.org/basic-documents。"
LCQ15: International Organization for Mediation,2025-07-09 11:45,2025-07-09 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900351.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Jeffrey Lam and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, in the Legislative Council today (July 9):

Question:

With the support of our country, the headquarters of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) has been formally established in Hong Kong and is expected to come into operation by the end of this year or early next year. In addition, 33 countries signed the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (the Convention) on May 30 this year. There are views that as IOMed is the first international inter-governmental organisation setting up its headquarters in Hong Kong, the position of Hong Kong as ""the leading centre for international legal and dispute resolution services in the Asia-Pacific Region"" will further be strengthened. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has estimated the benefits to be brought to Hong Kong by IOMed or set the relevant performance indicators (e.g. the numbers of additional positions, such as mediators, translators and researchers, etc, to be created, as well as the numbers of international organisations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions which will establish a new presence in Hong Kong); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will consider making the relevant estimations and setting performance indicators;

(2) whether it knows if IOMed has formulated the specific selection criteria for mediators, as well as the relevant guidelines and review mechanism, so as to ensure that mediators are able to provide mediation services at a reasonable professional standard; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and when such formulation will be completed; and

(3) while it has been reported that all countries, not limited to the signatories of the Convention, have access to the services of IOMed, there are views that given the nature of the law which is highly specific to a particular region (i.e. different jurisdictions have different legal systems and regimes), the outcome which can be achieved through mediation services may significantly fall short of expectation of the parties to a dispute since legal concepts may subject to different interpretations by different parties, whether the headquarters of IOMed will formulate co-ordination policies to ensure that its mediation services will bring a reasonable level of satisfaction to the parties to disputes from different jurisdictions?

Reply:

President,

In response to the enquiry raised by the Hon Jeffrey Lam, the consolidated reply is as follows:

(1) and (3)The establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong will assist in attracting people from all over the world to come to Hong Kong to resolve disputes through mediation and other means, strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal and dispute resolution services centre. IOMed also attracts more international organisations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions to settle in Hong Kong, which further consolidate Hong Kong's international status and reputation. It is expected to bring positive economic benefits to Hong Kong. The establishment of IOMed will create more employment opportunities for Hong Kong, such as mediators, translators, researchers and administrative staff. This also attracts international legal professionals and scholars to Hong Kong, which will help promoting the development of legal practice, research and international judicial co-operation, and strengthening Hong Kong's international legal network. The IOMed headquarters being located in Wan Chai will not only promote the development of Hong Kong's international legal and dispute resolution services, but also attract more international conferences and exhibitions and other related activities to be held in Hong Kong, thereby promoting the development of other sectors such as hotels, catering and transportation logistics.

âIOMed will be officially established with its headquarters to be formally set up in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region following the adoption, signing and entry into force of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation. IOMed has not yet commenced its operation and hence no further details may be provided at the present stage. Same as other international inter-governmental organisations, IOMed will be an independent international organisation, which will make its own policy and decision for its operation (including whether and how to set any key performance indicator or any co-ordination policy).

(2)Chapter IV (Articles 19 to 23) of the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation governs the Panel of Mediators of IOMed, including designation of mediators, qualifications of mediators and their term of office. Please see www.international-mediation.org/basic-documentsfor the Articles under the Convention."

問題：

據報每逢啟德體育園（體育園）舉辦演唱會和大型賽事，不少私家車違法停泊在體育園周邊區域的道路，造成交通嚴重堵塞，並對其他道路使用者構成危險。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）警方在體育園周邊區域針對涉及違法駕駛者所採取的執法行動為何，以及有否評估該等行動的成效；

（二）鑑於體育園在舉辦演唱會和賽事期間會暫停開放私家車泊車位及上落客位，政府會否考慮調整有關安排，在大型活動期間開放該園的私家車泊車位及上落客位予公眾使用；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）有否研究在體育園鄰近地方興建多層停車場，以解決該區域泊車位不足問題；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就楊永杰議員關於啟德體育園周邊泊車安排的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局、警務處及運輸署，我現綜合回覆如下：

（一）警務處一直密切監察啟德體育園周邊道路在舉行大型活動期間的交通情況。如果發現有司機違例泊車，造成交通嚴重阻塞，或對其他道路使用者構成危險，警務處除了會對有關人士和車輛採取執法行動外，亦會按情況在不予警告下即時把車輛拖走。

自啟德體育園由本年三月開幕至六月中旬期間，園區曾舉辦七項大型活動，活動總日數為十九日。期間，警務處共發出190張定額罰款通知書及拖走15輛違例車輛。

警務處將繼續根據「重點交通執法項目」打擊交通違例行為，確保道路暢順及保障道路使用者安全。


（二）及（三）目前，啟德體育園區共提供約600個私家車泊車位供日常前往園區的駕駛者使用。在大型活動舉行期間，考慮到園區附近一帶的交通較為繁忙，為配合人流及交通管理，政府一直呼籲前往園區的觀眾乘搭公共交通工具，避免駕駛或乘坐私家車。因應活動的規模，運輸署會協調公共交通營辦商調整公共交通服務，在相關時段加密港鐵屯馬綫的班次、按需要加強巴士服務或安排特別巴士路線等，配合活動進行期間額外的交通需求。

運輸署亦就園區交通事宜與文化體育及旅遊局、其他相關部門及啟德體育園有限公司保持緊密溝通，商討進一步優化安排。在汲取各個大型活動的經驗和私家車使用者的意見後，為提供更佳便利，園區已於今年六月起在大型活動期間開放啟德主場館的士上落客區供的士上落客之用，亦增設啟德體藝館泊車位預約服務。有需要的駕駛者可預先購買啟德體藝館停車場泊車證和提前預約，以在大型活動期間使用部分泊車位。此外，園區附近亦有其他泊車地點，例如距離約10至15分鐘步程的兩個購物商場共提供約1 300個私家車泊位。駕駛者可透過運輸署的「香港出行易」程式，查閱園區及上述兩個商場泊車設施的可用車位實時資訊。

如上所述，啟德體育園區及鄰近商場共提供約1 900個私家車泊位。運輸署會與啟德體育園有限公司緊密聯繫，善用現有泊車設施並持續優化園區的泊車安排。運輸署亦會持續監察區內整體泊車需求，並與相關部門適時檢討，確保交通配套與區域發展相配合。"

Question:

It is reported that whenever concerts and major games are held at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), many private cars are illegally parked on roads around KTSP, causing severe traffic congestion and posing dangers to other road users. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the enforcement actions taken by the Police against persons involved in driving offences in areas surrounding KTSP, and whether the effectiveness of such actions has been assessed;

(2) given that private car parking spaces and pick-up/drop-off areas at KTSP are temporarily closed when concerts and games are held there, whether the Government will consider adjusting such arrangements to allow public access to private car parking spaces and pick-up/drop-off areas at KTSP during major events; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it has conducted studies on constructing a multi-storey car park in the vicinity of KTSP to address the shortage of parking spaces in the area; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

After consulting the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), my consolidated response to the questions raised by the Hon Yang Wing-kit regarding the parking arrangements around the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is as follows:

(1) The HKPF has always been closely monitoring the road traffic conditions around the KTSP during major events. When illegal parking activities causing severe traffic congestion or endangering other road users are spotted, the HKPF will take enforcement action against the motorists and vehicles involved and, where appropriate, tow the vehicles away without prior warning.

Since the commissioning of the KTSP in March up to mid-June this year, the venue has hosted seven major events spanning 19 days, during when the HKPF issued a total of 190 fixed penalty notices and towed away 15 illegally parked vehicles.

The HKPF will continue to combat traffic offences in accordance with the Selected Traffic Enforcement Priorities to ensure smooth traffic flow and protect the safety of road users.

(2) and (3) At present, the KTSP provides about 600 private cars (PC) parking spaces for the daily use of motorists. During major events, in view of heavier traffic in KTSP's vicinity and in order to facilitate crowd and traffic management, the Government always encourages visitors to use public transport, avoid driving or taking PCs. Having regard to the scale of the event, the TD will co-ordinate with public transport operators to adjust public transport services, enhancing the interval between trains of the MTR Tuen Ma Line during such occasions, enhacing bus services or arranging special bus services as needed to meet the additional traffic demand during the event period.

The TD also maintains close communication with the CSTB, other relevant departments, and Kai Tak Sports Park Limited regarding traffic issues around the KTSP, and discusses further enhancements to traffic arrangements. Drawing on the experience of various large-scale events and feedback from PC users, the KTSP has, since June this year, opened the taxi pick-up/drop-off area at Kai Tak Stadium for taxi use and introduced a parking space booking service for PC users at Kai Tak Arena to enhance convenience. Motorists with parking needs may purchase parking voucher in advance to reserve parking spaces at the Kai Tak Arena car park during major events. In addition, there are other parking spaces available near the KTSP, including two shopping malls within a 10 to 15-minute walk that collectively offer about 1 300 PC parking spaces. Motorists may check real-time parking vacancy information of car parks at the KTSP and the above two shopping malls via TD's ""HKeMobility"" mobile application.

As mentioned above, the KTSP and the nearby shopping malls together offer a total of about 1 900 PC parking spaces. The TD will maintain close liaison with Kai Tak Sports Park Limited for making optimal use of the exitsing parking facilities and continuing to enhance the parking arranagements in the KTSP. The TD will also continue to monitor the overall parking demand in the district, and conduct timely review with relevant departments to ensure the transport facilities keep pace with the district development."
Government invites tenders for short-term tenancy in Ma On Shan for fee-paying public car park with installation of automated parking system,2025-07-09 11:00,2025-07-09 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900264.htm,"  The Government today (July 9) invites tenders for a short-term tenancy (STT) of one lot of government land at Po Tai Street in Ma On Shan (STT No. STTST0065) to be used for a fee-paying public car park, with the installation of an automated parking system (APS) as the sixth APS project at a government STT site so far. The tenancy is for a fixed term of seven years and renewable thereafter on a half-yearly basis.

  A spokesman for the Transport Department said that the application of APS can utilise space more effectively and increase parking efficiency, alleviating the public demand for parking spaces. The Government is actively taking forward APS projects in suitable STT car parks. The first three APS projects at Hoi Shing Road in Tsuen Wan, Pak Shek Kok in Tai Po and Tung Chau Street in Sham Shui Po have already commenced services, providing about 180 automated parking spaces in total. The APS project at the STT car park at Hoi Wang Road in Yau Ma Tei is expected to be commissioned this year. In addition, APS will also be installed at the STT car park at Lok Wah Street in Tsz Wan Shan and the above project at Po Tai Street in Ma On Shan, and tendering is under way.

  Regarding the tender for the Ma On Shan project, under the tenancy agreement, the successful tenderer is required to erect, construct and install an APS at the site within 15 months from the commencement date of the tenancy, providing not less than 104 automated parking spaces out of a total minimum of 247 parking spaces.

  The Tender Document can be obtained from the Lands Department website (www.landsd.gov.hk) or the following offices:

1. The Survey and Mapping Office, Lands Department, 6/F, North Point Government Offices, 333 Java Road, North Point; and
2. The District Lands Office, Sha Tin, 11/F, Sha Tin Government Offices, 1 Sheung Wo Che Road, Sha Tin.

  Prospective tenderers must pay attention to all the requirements set out in the tender notice and the tenancy agreement of the tender document.

  Tenders must be deposited in the Public Works Tender Box situated at Room 503, 5/F, Low Block, Queensway Government Offices, 66 Queensway, Hong Kong, before noon on August 22 (Friday). Late tenders will not be accepted."

Speech by FS at Hong Kong - Korea Capital Markets Conference (English only) (with photos/video),2025-07-09 10:52,2025-07-09 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900263.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong – Korea Capital Markets Conference held in Seoul, Korea today (July 9):

Mr Seo (Chairman of the Korea Financial Investment Association, Mr Seo Yoo-seok), Greg (Managing Director and Head of Markets, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mr Gregory Yu), Ms Ding Chen (Chief Executive Officer of CSOP Asset Management Limited), ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo. Good morning.

It is a great honour and pleasure to be here with you today in Seoul. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to CSOP Asset Management and all the co-organisers for bringing together such a distinguished gathering. I am especially pleased to see so many esteemed representatives from Korean institutional investors, securities firms, asset managers, regulators, and, of course, our colleagues from Hong Kong's financial community.

Hong Kong: what's up

Allow me to begin with a snapshot of Hong Kong's current position, as reflected in international rankings. This year, Hong Kong is once again ranked among the world's top three financial centres. We were also named as the world's third most competitive economy by Switzerland's IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. Last year, the Fraser Institute of Canada reaffirmed our status as the world's freest economy. Our city continues to enjoy positive credit ratings from all three major international agencies—Fitch, Standard & Poor's, and Moody's—with stable outlooks.

These accolades are not symbolic. They reflect the resilience of our financial markets and the confidence international investors place in Hong Kong. Last year, our stock market rose by 18 per cent, and it has already gained another 20 per cent so far this year. Initial public offerings (IPOs) have raised about $16 billion this year to date, making Hong Kong the world's leading IPO venue so far this year. Meanwhile, total bank deposits grew by 7per cent last year, i.e. about US$13 billion, and again by around 7per cent this year, now surpassing US$2.3 trillion, about 6 times our GDP. Our asset and wealth management sector currently manages around US$4 trillion, and is on track to become the world's top cross-border wealth management centre by 2028.

These positive developments are driven by our strong fundamentals, a steadily growing China and the shifting global financial landscape. At the core of Hong Kong's success are our enduring values: openness, diversity, international character and global connectivity. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong preserves its free port status, with the free flow of capital, information, goods and talent. We uphold the common law system with an independent judiciary. In our Court of Final Appeal, there are six overseas non-permanent judges coming from the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and New Zealand. In the Rule of Law Index of the World Justice Report, Hong Kong ranks among the global top 25, and in the top 10 for free of corruption. Our currency is pegged to the United States (US) dollar and remains freely convertible. The Linked Exchange Rate System functions smoothly despite geopolitical fragmentation, and capital flow volatility.

The Central Government of China has repeatedly reaffirmed time and again that the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement for Hong Kong is not for expediency; it is here to stay for the long term. As a two-way gateway between the Chinese Mainland and the world, Hong Kong plays a unique and indispensable role for the country's high-level two-way opening up.

Indeed, over the past few years, we have gone through some challenges. But once again Hong Kong has restored political stability as well as law and order, and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.

Global dynamics and investment trends

Looking ahead, the global political, economic and financial environment are undergoing profound transformations, and this morning I would like to highlight just three key points. First, the geopolitical climate and the policy uncertainty in the United States. These conditions are expected to persist for some time, and have prompted investors to reassess risk, diversify capital allocations and seek markets that offer both resilience and growth. In this context, Hong Kong stands out as a safe harbour for global capital, providing policy consistency, predictability and strategic access to China and the broader Asian region.

Recent data underscores this momentum. The rally in our stock market since last year has been fuelled by both Mainland and international capital. In February this year, Korean investors made their highest monthly net investment in Hong Kong equities in three years. Very good foresight. And they were not alone. Since September last year, waves of capital from the US and Europe had also poured in, as global investors realised that they had under-allocated to the Greater China market.

We expect continued momentum, especially as more high-quality Mainland tech companies choose Hong Kong over US listings. We are also prepared for the return of Chinese concept stocks from the US.

The geopolitical recalibration is not temporary. It will also go beyond the financial market. Economies in our region are already calling for deeper collaboration across trade, manufacturing, supply chains and investment. This presents exciting opportunities for deeper collaboration between Hong Kong and Korea – two of Asia's most dynamic and sophisticated financial ecosystems.

The second point is the rapid acceleration of technological innovation, an area where Asia holds tremendous promise. For example, in China, we are seeing major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, electric vehicles, green technologies and advanced manufacturing. Open-source AI models such as DeepSeek are emerging as scalable, cost-effective solutions with wide-ranging applications. Increasingly, Chinese firms are turning to Hong Kong to raise capital to support the expansion of their global footprint.

  A recent example is CATL, the world's leading EV (electric vehicle) battery manufacturer, which completed the world's largest IPO so far this year in Hong Kong. The funds raised will support its expansion into Europe, including a new plant in Hungary. Currently, over 200 major Mainland companies are in the pipeline for listing in Hong Kong. Many of them are China's technology and new economy companies.

International investors are increasingly leveraging Hong Kong to take advantage of China's tech sector development. This trend is reflected in the performance of the Hang Seng Tech Index, which has gained more than 40per cent over the past year, driven by renewed investor interest and optimism.

The third point is the increasing importance of cross-border market connectivity. A unique strength of Hong Kong's capital market is our ""Connect Schemes"" with the Chinese Mainland, including Stock Connect, Bond Connect, ETF Connect, and more. These schemes are significant in two ways. First, they allow Mainland Chinese capital to flow into Hong Kong's markets, making us a convergence point for international and Mainland liquidity. Second, they offer trusted and familiar channels for international investors to access the Chinese markets. Today, over 70per cent of A-share holdings by international investors were acquired through the Northbound Stock Connect, and about two-thirds of Mainland cross-border bond transactions are conducted using Bond Connect.

Beyond the Chinese Mainland, we are also expanding mutual market access with other regions. A great example is our growing partnership with Saudi Arabia. In the past two years, we have listed ETFs in our respective stock markets. By the way, one ETF listed on Saudi's market tracking Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was issued by CSOP. It is now the largest ETF in the Middle East.

Indeed, our Exchange-Traded Products (ETP) market is booming. As of May 2025, Hong Kong hosts more than 210 ETPs with over US$65 billion in AUM (assets under management), a 10per cent increase year-on-year. Daily trading volumes had more than doubled compared to 2024, exceeding US$5 billion. This year, there have been 24 new product launches, including the cross-listing of the world's fifth-largest ETF from the US earlier this year.

We are actively encouraging global ETPs to enter the Hong Kong market, whether through direct cross-listings or master-feeder structures. Our ETF ecosystem is becoming more diverse and global, with growing demand for thematic products across stocks, fixed income, commodities, currencies and digital assets. In digital assets, Hong Kong leads Asia with 10 ETPs, including both spot and futures-based ones. Their AUM registered a 74per cent growth year-on-year in the first half of 2025, and a 33per centrise in daily turnover.

Some Korean firms are already active in our ETP market as issuers and market makers. We believe it is now the opportune moment to deepen our collaboration in this space through cross-listings, reciprocal arrangements and master-feeder partnerships.

Our HKEX colleagues will elaborate on these exciting opportunities shortly.

Finally, let me now turn to digital assets, a frontier where Hong Kong is taking bold and forward-looking steps to become a global hub. Our approach is pragmatic, risk-based and innovation-friendly. We believe digital assets will play a transformative role in de-intermediation and cross-border settlement. That said, we are also clear-eyed: appropriate regulatory safeguards are essential.

We have launched a licensing regime for Virtual Asset Trading Platforms, guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"". Sound regulation, we believe, is not a constraint, but a catalyst for sustainable innovation. So far, we have licensed 11 VATPs, with balanced requirements on custody, anti-money laundering and investor protection.

We also support tokenisation across traditional finance, from green bonds to asset-backed security tokens and structured products.

Building on this foundation, we have passed legislation for stablecoins, which will come into effect on August 1. Our goal is to support stablecoins that serve real-world use cases, reducing transaction costs and enabling faster, safer cross-border payments.

Hong Kong's digital asset ecosystem continues to thrive, and many Web3 innovators are choosing to base themselves in our city. We see tremendous potential for Korean innovators and investors as well.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot better conclude by highlighting the compelling advantages we offer to Korean investors: no dividend tax, no capital gains tax, a low profits tax at only 16.5 per cent, trading in multiple currencies, including HKD, USD and RMB, and trading hours aligned with the Asian time zone.

Above all, we are entering a new era for Asia. Geopolitics, technological innovation and regional integration are converging. While they present challenges, they also create unprecedented opportunities. Hong Kong stands ready to be your partner, offering stability in uncertain times, unparalled access to the world's fastest-growing markets, and a platform built on transparency, trustworthiness and innovation.

Together, Hong Kong and Korea can build stronger bridges, unlock new investment frontiers, and shape the future of finance in Asia and beyond.

Kamsahamnida. Thank you."
Speech by FS at Hong Kong - Korea Capital Markets Conference (English only) (with photos),2025-07-09 10:52,2025-07-09 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900263.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong – Korea Capital Markets Conference held in Seoul, Korea today (July 9):

Mr Seo (Chairman of the Korea Financial Investment Association, Mr Seo Yoo-seok), Greg (Managing Director and Head of Markets, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, Mr Gregory Yu), Ms Ding Chen (Chief Executive Officer of CSOP Asset Management Limited), ladies and gentlemen,

Annyeonghaseyo. Good morning.

It is a great honour and pleasure to be here with you today in Seoul. I would like to express my sincere appreciation to CSOP Asset Management and all the co-organisers for bringing together such a distinguished gathering. I am especially pleased to see so many esteemed representatives from Korean institutional investors, securities firms, asset managers, regulators, and, of course, our colleagues from Hong Kong's financial community.

Hong Kong: what's up

Allow me to begin with a snapshot of Hong Kong's current position, as reflected in international rankings. This year, Hong Kong is once again ranked among the world's top three financial centres. We were also named as the world's third most competitive economy by Switzerland's IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook. Last year, the Fraser Institute of Canada reaffirmed our status as the world's freest economy. Our city continues to enjoy positive credit ratings from all three major international agencies—Fitch, Standard & Poor's, and Moody's—with stable outlooks.

These accolades are not symbolic. They reflect the resilience of our financial markets and the confidence international investors place in Hong Kong. Last year, our stock market rose by 18 per cent, and it has already gained another 20 per cent so far this year. Initial public offerings (IPOs) have raised about $16 billion this year to date, making Hong Kong the world's leading IPO venue so far this year. Meanwhile, total bank deposits grew by 7per cent last year, i.e. about US$13 billion, and again by around 7per cent this year, now surpassing US$2.3 trillion, about 6 times our GDP. Our asset and wealth management sector currently manages around US$4 trillion, and is on track to become the world's top cross-border wealth management centre by 2028.

These positive developments are driven by our strong fundamentals, a steadily growing China and the shifting global financial landscape. At the core of Hong Kong's success are our enduring values: openness, diversity, international character and global connectivity. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong preserves its free port status, with the free flow of capital, information, goods and talent. We uphold the common law system with an independent judiciary. In our Court of Final Appeal, there are six overseas non-permanent judges coming from the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and New Zealand. In the Rule of Law Index of the World Justice Report, Hong Kong ranks among the global top 25, and in the top 10 for free of corruption. Our currency is pegged to the United States (US) dollar and remains freely convertible. The Linked Exchange Rate System functions smoothly despite geopolitical fragmentation, and capital flow volatility.

The Central Government of China has repeatedly reaffirmed time and again that the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement for Hong Kong is not for expediency; it is here to stay for the long term. As a two-way gateway between the Chinese Mainland and the world, Hong Kong plays a unique and indispensable role for the country's high-level two-way opening up.

Indeed, over the past few years, we have gone through some challenges. But once again Hong Kong has restored political stability as well as law and order, and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.

Global dynamics and investment trends

Looking ahead, the global political, economic and financial environment are undergoing profound transformations, and this morning I would like to highlight just three key points. First, the geopolitical climate and the policy uncertainty in the United States. These conditions are expected to persist for some time, and have prompted investors to reassess risk, diversify capital allocations and seek markets that offer both resilience and growth. In this context, Hong Kong stands out as a safe harbour for global capital, providing policy consistency, predictability and strategic access to China and the broader Asian region.

Recent data underscores this momentum. The rally in our stock market since last year has been fuelled by both Mainland and international capital. In February this year, Korean investors made their highest monthly net investment in Hong Kong equities in three years. Very good foresight. And they were not alone. Since September last year, waves of capital from the US and Europe had also poured in, as global investors realised that they had under-allocated to the Greater China market.

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-09 09:40,2025-07-09 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/09/P2025070900254.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

"Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao hold ""open to inclusive, progress together"" joint press conference for NG, NGD and NSOG in Guangzhou (with photos)",2025-07-08 23:00,2025-07-08 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/08/P2025070800759.htm,"âThe Guangdong Provincial Executive Committees for the 15th National Games (NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG), the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) (NGCO) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Preparatory Office for the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG in Macao (Preparatory Office in Macao) today (July 8) held a press conference on the topic of ""open to inclusive, progress together"" in Guangzhou to introduce the details of preparation progress for the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG, and the upcoming operational work plan among the three places.

  âThe Director of the Office of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG and Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Government of Guangdong Province, Mr Huang Mingzhong; the Head of the NGCO, Mr Yeung Tak-keung; and the Head of the Preparatory Office in Macao, Mr Pun Weng-kun, addressed the conference, highlighting the collaborative progress of the three places. Hong Kong cyclist Wong Kam-po and Macao martial arts athlete Li Yi also shared their aspirations.

  âMr Huang said at the press conference that the cohosting of the 15th NG by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, under the steer of the central ministries including the General Administration of Sport of China and the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, has built an innovative co-ordination mechanism. Through close liaison and co-ordination, alignment has been reached in six key areas: cross-boundary events, port clearance, manpower and vehicle accreditation, food safety, green initiatives, and competition schedule. The three places have pioneered a ""three-place three-integration"" cohosting approach - integrated communication, direction, and operation.

  âMr Yeung said, ""Hong Kong firmly adheres to the principles of 'green, inclusive, open and clean' while implementing the requirement of organising a 'simple, safe and wonderful' event. We maintain strict budget control, optimise resource allocation, and prudently scale events to ensure practical preparations."" He highlighted that the cross-boundary athletics marathon and road cycling events, which will be co-organised by Hong Kong, are signature events of the 15th NG, requiring meticulous tripartite planning and co-ordination in route design and expedited clearance for athletes, spectators and vehicles. This cross-boundary collaboration enhances the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s overall competitiveness and fosters people-to-people exchanges in the GBA. Wong said that with the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge as the race course, the cross-border road cycling race is an iconic event with beautiful scenery and a challenging course as well.

  âMr Pun said that preparations for the 15th NG have entered the countdown phase. They will collaborate with different sectors of society to strengthen the organisational work for the events, enhancing the atmosphere of community-wide participation in the 15th NG. This includes ongoing visits to communities and schools, connecting with promotional activities for culture, tourism, and sports, and launching franchised products in Macao.

  âVarious franchised products were also showcased at the press conference, with designers explaining their creative concepts. Hong Kong will soon set up sales points in various districts to sell a variety of franchised products related to the 15th NG, 12th NGD and 9th NSOG, including products with unique Hong Kong features.
