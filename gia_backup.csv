Speech by FS at Defining Hong Kong's Role in the Changing Global Economy conference (English only) (with photos/video),2025-11-18 11:35,2025-11-18 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800276.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Defining Hong Kong's Role in the Changing Global Economy conference today (November 18):

Mr Robin Harding (Asia Editor for the Financial Times), Daryl (Chairman of the Sino Group, Mr Daryl Ng), Consuls-General, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a pleasure to join you at this conference, a gathering of policymakers, distinguished business leaders and innovators, to explore Hong Kong's evolving role in the global economy.

  I'm sure that by the end of today's discussions, you will appreciate Hong Kong more and recognise the enduring value we bring to the world.

  In considering Hong Kong's role in the changing global economy, allow me to highlight our two major development priorities: strengthening our position as an international financial centre and advancing innovation and technology.

Hong Kong as a rising IFC

  First, geopolitical developments are elevating - rather than diminishing - Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre (IFC). As you may recall, the opening months of 2025 were marked by significant policy shifts in the United States (US), bringing a new level of uncertainty to the global markets. In the wake of the turbulent Liberation Day saga, investors around the world responded with heightened caution, reassessing risks and recalibrating their strategies.

  And consider this data: gold prices have surged by over 55 per cent this year, reflecting heightened risk aversion. Bitcoin had once soared by more than 110 per cent, demonstrating demand for alternative stores of value. The equity markets in the US boomed - for instance, the S&P 500 rose by around 14 per cent, but the US dollar depreciated by around 10 per cent, with 10-year Treasury yields having fallen by more than 60 basis points.

  What do these tell us? They revealed that amid heighted policy uncertainty and market volatility, investors are seeking safe havens. In this process, they look for transparent, consistent and stable policy environments, and value jurisdictions with familiar legal systems and trusted regulatory frameworks.

  They, of course, continue to pursue returns. Yes, Hong Kong is the answer. At the start of this year, the average P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of Hong Kong stocks were only around 12. And when the DeepSeek moment highlighted China's technological strength and cost efficiency, global investors quickly realised they had underallocated to this region.

  Indeed, this wave of global investor interest has translated into significant capital flow into our market. The Hang Seng Index has surged by over 30 per cent year-to-date, following an 18 per cent gain last year, with an average daily turnover more than doubled that of last year. IPO (initial public offering) fundraising reached approximately US$28 billion as of October, making Hong Kong the global leader in new listings so far this year. Follow-on fundraising has been even stronger, reaching US$61 billion in the same period.

  The asset and wealth management industry is also experiencing robust growth, with strong capital inflows. In the first eight months of this year, Hong Kong-domiciled funds recorded net inflows of US$43 billion.

  Bank deposits have increased by 10 per cent so far this year, reaching over US$2.4 trillion.

  Financial institutions have responded accordingly, with many expanding their operations in the city. We are seeing leading financial firms leasing larger office spaces, and in the case of some fintech companies, even acquiring entire building blocks.

  Going forward, geo-economic reconfiguration is accelerating regional economic co-operation and advancing trade and investment within blocs. We are witnessing growing momentum in initiatives such as FTA (free trade agreement) 3.0 between China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), as well as the expanding corridors of collaboration with the Middle East. Within these, Hong Kong plays a pivotal and strategic role - connecting markets, channelling capital, matching businesses, and providing professional expertise.

  On capital markets, bilateral cross-border collaboration is gaining significant traction. Hong Kong's deepening cross-border collaboration with the Middle East is a compelling case in point. Over the past few years, we have worked closely with Saudi's Tadawul to facilitate the mutual listing of ETFs (exchange-traded funds) on each other's market. We then strengthened cross-border regulatory collaboration to pave the way for dual listings. Last week, we marked a historic milestone by welcoming the first Middle Eastern company to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

  Indeed, our collaboration extends beyond finance into the industrial and commercial sectors. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will soon jointly launch a US$1 billion fund to support Hong Kong and Greater Bay Area companies to expand into Saudi Arabia, contributing to the development of non-oil economic sectors in Saudi Arabia. Next month, a major Saudi development company will be hosting a roadshow in Hong Kong to seek strategic partners and professional service providers to support their infrastructure development.

Innovation and technology

  The second major development direction for Hong Kong is innovation and technology - our new engine of growth.

  Our strategy focuses on sectors where we hold a competitive advantage: artificial intelligence (AI), biotech, fintech, as well as new energy and new materials.

  To realise this vision, several key elements are essential: cutting-edge technology, technology enterprises, talent, market, land resources and capital.

  On the enterprise front, we have established the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES), dedicated to bringing in high-impact, high-potential tech companies engaged in frontier technologies. Over the past three years, we have attracted over 100 such enterprises, many of which are global leaders in their respective fields. Collectively, these companies are expected to invest around US$8 billion in Hong Kong, creating about 22 000 quality jobs. Many are now setting up R&D (research and development) centres or regional headquarters in this city, often bringing with them upstream and downstream partners, thereby further enriching our innovation ecosystem.

  We have established the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, HKIC, as patient capital, to help us realise this vision. I'm sure Clara (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, Ms Clara Chan) will share more on this at the upcoming panel session.

  In terms of land resources, the Northern Metropolis will be the carrier of our vision for innovation and technology. It also functions as a strategic base for collaboration with other Greater Bay Area cities, in particular Shenzhen. We are accelerating its development through innovative policies and tailor-made incentive packages. The goal is to anchor leading technology companies here to build a vibrant ecosystem so that our vision in innovation and technology will be deeply ingrained with industry development.

  Speaking of the Greater Bay Area, there is an additional advantage that few regions can match. It is where high-end manufacturing capabilities and cutting-edge AI innovation simultaneously reside. AI technology can be directly and seamlessly applied, tested and validated in real-world industrial settings.

  On talent, Hong Kong continues to be a magnet for global professionals. Since the launch of new and enhanced talent admission schemes at the end of 2022, we have received over 550 000 applications, approved more than 370 000, and more than 250 000 individuals have already arrived.

  In fact, amid the geopolitical landscape, we have recently welcomed hundreds of scholars, researchers and world-renowned academics. And outstanding students are on their way here too. Here in Hong Kong, we believe that intellectual excellence knows no borders. We welcome the world's brightest minds to our city where merit - not politics - defines opportunity.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, in short, Hong Kong is accelerating its role as both an international financial centre and a premier global innovation hub. Few cities in the world can lead in these dimensions simultaneously - and with such momentum.

  I wish you all a rewarding summit, and good health and continued success in the time ahead. Thank you very much."

"Denmark theatre troupe Teater Katapult to make Hong Kong debut with award-winning work ""The Insider"" in December (with photos) ",2025-11-18 11:30,2025-11-18 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800253.htm,"  Denmark theatre troupe Teater Katapult will perform in Hong Kong for the first time with their solo play ""The Insider"" at the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's ""European Theatres in Resonance"" in December. The work is based on the German State's crown witness in the real international case of dividend tax fraud. Combining live acting with visuals and a binaural soundscape, it is aimed at giving audiences a sensually thrilling immersive theatrical experience.

  ""The Insider"" is inspired by the ""Cum-Ex scandal"", a real international case of dividend tax fraud involving an amount as high as 53 billion euros, causing a stir among many European countries. The story is about a young father and tax lawyer who works in one of the world's largest banks. As an ambitious freshman with an ingenious interpretation of the tax laws, he begins to exploit the benefits from a loophole in the financial system, leading to a bloodbath of state treasury looting. Nonetheless, he makes his pivotal shift in allegiance later to assist the police in dismantling an extensive network of criminal accomplices.

  The production is directed by Johan Sarauw and stars Christoffer Hvidberg Rønje. With headphones on throughout the performance, audiences will experience the extraordinary 3D binaural sound, cinematic sound, and the voices of multiple characters, going into the inner world of the mastermind with an immersive sensory experience, as well as experiencing his personal journey. Simultaneously, Rønje will solely perform inside a glass cubicle on the stage, showcasing the emotional changes through his physical movements and facial expressions. Accompanied by the transforming scenes with evolving video projections on the glass box, audiences will be guided to travel around the world to follow the case, enhancing the dramatic tension of the play while exploring the human face of greed. The production won the Scotsman Fringe First award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2023 and garnered acclaim during tours across Europe and in Korea.

  Teater Katapult was founded in Denmark by the present Artistic & Managing Director, Torben Dahl, in 1995. It is based on the idea to challenge people through the arts. The main goal is to make people more conscious of themselves and the world around them, and at the same time feel moved through both their senses and intellect. The company has two theatre spaces in Aarhus. They develop, produce, and present new contemporary drama, and present works by Danish as well as international companies.

  ""The Insider"" by Teater Katapult (Denmark) will be held at 8pm on December 19 and 20 (Friday and Saturday), and at 3pm on December 20 and 21 (Saturday and Sunday) at the Studio Theatre of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. The programme will be conducted in English with Chinese and English surtitles. Tickets priced at $320 and $420 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288. The ""European Theatres in Resonance"" also includes ""Songs of Lear"" by Song of the Goat Theatre (Poland) to be held from February 6 to 8 next year. A discount will be offered for those purchasing standard tickets of both performances of ""The Insider"" and ""Songs of Lear"". For programme enquiries and concessionary schemes, please call 2268 7325 or visit www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/Programme/en/theatre/programs_1925.html. The programme contains inappropriate language and is recommended for people aged 16 and above. Evening performance on December 19 and matinee performance on December 20 will be followed by a meet-the-artist session (conducted in English). Members of the audience are welcome to stay behind to join."
衞生署呼籲市民響應「世界抗菌素耐藥性關注周」善用抗生素,2025-11-18 11:28,2025-11-18 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800249.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十八日）呼籲醫護人員及市民共同採取行動，對抗抗菌素耐藥性，以響應二○二五年「世界抗菌素耐藥性關注周」。抗菌素是用於治療感染的藥物，其中包括專用於對抗細菌感染的抗生素。抗菌素耐藥性，是指微生物（如細菌、病毒）適應了在有抗菌素的環境下生長，對過去有效的藥物不再有反應。濫用和不當使用抗生素的行為是導致耐藥性問題的主因。政府一直高度重視應對抗菌素耐藥性，於二○二二年發表第二份《香港抗菌素耐藥性策略及行動計劃》（《行動計劃》），為二○二三年至二○二七年制訂應對抗菌素耐藥性威脅而採取的策略，工作措施包括檢討和更新名為《效果》的抗菌素指引，並推廣該指引以供醫生基於實證為病人處方抗菌素。

世界衞生組織（世衞）將每年十一月十八日至二十四日定為「世界抗菌素耐藥性關注周」，今年的主題為「立即行動：守護當下，保障未來」。

中心顧問醫生（抗菌素耐藥性）馬紹強醫生說：「抗菌素耐藥性是全球最嚴峻的公共衞生挑戰之一。當細菌或病毒產生耐藥性，將導致感染變得更難甚至無法治愈。於二○二一年，全球約有471萬人的死亡與抗菌素耐藥性細菌有關。若不採取行動，預計到二○五○年，每年相關死亡人數將達822萬。而世衞估算二○二○至二○三○年間，本港將有18 433宗死亡個案與抗菌素耐藥性相關。為了讓市民更具體感受這些統計數字背後反映的是受影響的生命，中心製作了影片，邀請一位本地的倖存者現身說法，親述抗菌素耐藥性如何讓他險些喪命，突顯了這並非遙不可及的全球議題，而是可能發生在任何人身上的威脅。」

更新抗菌素指引供醫生參考
————————————

政府將繼續全面推動《行動計劃》，以「一體化」方針整合人類、動物及環境衞生的工作。

馬紹強醫生說：「今年六月，中心推出第六版《效果》，就不同感染情況提供用藥建議，讓全港醫生為住院病人處方抗菌藥物時作為參考。中心並透過專業論壇及發信，向醫生推廣參考《效果》適切處方。同步更新的流動應用程式（二○二五年九月版）已於iOS及Android平台上架，方便醫護查閱。」

他指出，不論公營或私營的醫院亦已推行「抗生素導向計劃」，最新監測數據顯示抗菌素處方模式有所改善：本港「謹慎使用類」抗菌素（世衞認定為較大機會引發耐藥性的抗菌素）佔全港抗菌素的供應量，從二○一六年的40.3%降至二○二四年的34.6%，顯示醫生相對較少處方廣譜抗生素，有助應對抗菌素耐藥性的問題。

加強打擊非法銷售抗菌素
———————————

為保障抗菌素的效用，衞生署積極加強打擊非法銷售抗菌素。監測數據顯示社區藥房抗菌素批發供應量從二○一六年的18.5%持續下降至二○二四年的3.4%。此外，在中心不斷加強公眾教育，市民對耐藥性認知有所提升。根據中心於二○二四年進行的調查顯示，市民對「抗生素耐藥性」的認知度達70.9%；絕大部分（96.3%）市民表示，最近使用的抗生素經醫生處方，反映正確用藥意識提升。此外，長者群組對耐藥性的認知度亦有所進步，充分彰顯宣傳的成效。

然而，調查亦發現約四分之一受訪者（25.6%）不知道進食生或未經煮熟食物會增加微生物感染風險（包括耐藥性細菌）。此外，即食食品中的耐藥性細菌呈上升趨勢。根據中心委託機構進行檢測所得的數據，超廣譜β-內酰胺酶耐藥性腸道桿菌（一種耐藥性細菌）在即食食品樣本中的檢出率從二○一八／一九年度的5.9%上升至二○二三／二四年度的13.3%，其中供生吃的即食蔬菜（36.7%）、滷味（20.0%）、預先切開的水果（16.3%）及燒味（14.3%）的上升尤其顯著。

中心呼籲市民遵照以下建議，與醫護人員合力消弭抗菌素耐藥性的問題：

• 抗生素僅對細菌感染有效，而對病毒性感染（如流感、2019冠狀病毒病）則無效。若有上呼吸道感染，應就醫，切勿自行到藥房購買抗生素服用；
• 不要向醫生要求抗生素。只有在醫生建議下，才服用抗生素，並須完成整個療程。即使症狀有所改善，也不應自行停用抗生素；
• 留意和遵循藥物袋上註明的注意事項，採取適當的感染控制措施，例如經常保持手部衞生、出現呼吸道症狀時佩戴外科口罩、妥善消毒和覆蓋所有傷口，以防止服用抗生素時耐藥菌以「人傳人」方式傳播；
• 接種季節性流感疫苗和2019冠狀病毒病疫苗，以預防繼發性細菌感染，從而減少使用抗生素，避免出現抗菌素耐藥性；
• 注意從即食食品中感染抗藥性細菌的風險。服用抗生素或抗酸劑的人，以及高危人士（例如孕婦、嬰幼兒、長者和免疫力弱的人），應避免食用生或未經徹底煮熟的即食食品；及
• 在廚房處理食物時，應保持良好的衞生習慣，減少耐藥性細菌交叉感染的風險。

DH reminds public to use antibiotics properly in support of World Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness Week,2025-11-18 11:28,2025-11-18 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800248.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 18) called on healthcare professionals and members of the public to take collective action against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in support of World Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2025. Antimicrobials are medications used to treat infections, including antibiotics, which are specifically used to treat bacterial infections. AMR occurs when microorganisms (such as bacteria and viruses) adapt to grow in an environment with antimicrobials, rendering previously effective medications ineffective. Misuse and inappropriate use of antibiotics are the primary causes of AMR. The Government has been placing great importance on combating AMR. In 2022, the Government published the second Hong Kong Strategy and Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, outlining strategies to tackle the threat of AMR from 2023 to 2027.Key measures include reviewing and updating the antimicrobial guidelines entitled the Interhospital Multi-disciplinary Programme on Antimicrobial ChemoTherapy (IMPACT), and promoting the guidelines to doctors to prescribe antimicrobials to patients in accordance with scientific evidence.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated November 18 to 24 every year as World Antimicrobial Resistance Awareness Week. This year's theme is ""Act Now: Protect Our Present, Secure Our Future"".

""AMR is one of the world's most serious public health challenges. When bacteria and viruses develop resistance, infections become harder to treat or even untreatable. In 2021, about 4.71 million deaths worldwide were associated with drug-resistant bacteria. If we fail to act, this figure is projected to rise to 8.22 million deaths annually by 2050. The WHO estimates that between 2020 and 2030, 18 433 deaths in Hong Kong will be AMR-related. To help the public better understand the affected lives behind these statistics, the CHP produced a video featuring a local survivor sharing his personal experience of how AMR nearly cost him his life. This highlights that AMR is not a distant global issue, but a threat that could affect anyone,"" said the Consultant (Antimicrobial Resistance) of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP), Dr Edmond Ma.

Updating antimicrobial guidelines for doctors' reference
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Government will continue to implement the Action Plan comprehensively to integrate human, animal, and environmental health efforts under the One Health framework.

""In June this year, the CHP launched the sixth edition of the IMPACT guidelines, which provide recommendations on prescriptions for different infections, serving as a reference for all doctors in Hong Kong when prescribing antimicrobial drugs to inpatients. The CHP also promoted appropriate prescribing practices in line with the IMPACT guidelines through a professional forum and a letter to doctors. The corresponding mobile application (September 2025 version) is now available on both iOS and Android platforms for the convenience of medical professionals,"" said Dr Ma.

He noted that Antimicrobial Stewardship Programmes have been implemented across public and private hospitals. The latest surveillance data reflected an improvement in prescribing practices. The proportion of antimicrobials in the Watch category (i.e. antimicrobials considered by the WHO to be at a higher risk of developing drug resistance) in the total supply of antimicrobials in Hong Kong decreased from 40.3 per cent in 2016 to 34.6 per cent in 2024. This indicated that doctors were prescribing fewer broad-spectrum antibiotics, which helped address the issue of AMR.

Strengthening crackdown on illegal sale of antimicrobials
----------------------------------------------------------------

To safeguard antimicrobial efficacy, the DH has stepped up efforts in combating the illegal sale of antimicrobials. According to the surveillance data, the wholesale supply of antimicrobials to community pharmacies has steadily decreased from 18.5 per cent in 2016 to 3.4 per cent in 2024. Furthermore, through the CHP's ongoing public education initiatives, public awareness of AMR has improved. According to the survey conducted by the CHP in 2024, 70.9 per cent of the public are aware of the term ""antibiotic resistance"", and the vast majority of respondents (96.3 per cent) indicated that their last course of antibiotics was prescribed by a doctor, reflecting an increased awareness of proper medicine use. Moreover, elderly respondents showed improved knowledge about drug resistance, showing the effectiveness of the publicity efforts.

Nevertheless, the survey also found that approximately one-quarter of respondents (25.6 per cent) were unaware that consuming raw or undercooked food increases the risk of infection from microorganisms, including drug-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, a rising trend in drug-resistant bacteria has been detected in ready-to-eat foods (RTE). According to the data from tests commissioned by the CHP, the proportion of Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) (a type of drug-resistant bacteria) rose from 5.9 per cent in 2018/19 to 13.3 per cent in 2023/24 among RTE food samples. The increase was particularly pronounced in RTE vegetables (36.7 per cent), lo mei (20.0 per cent), pre-cut fruits (16.3 per cent) and siu mei (14.3 per cent).

The CHP urged members of the public to work with healthcare professionals to eliminate AMR by observing the following:


Antibiotics are effective only in treating bacterial infections, not viral infections such as influenza and COVID-19. When you have an upper respiratory tract infection, consult a doctor. Do not buy or consume antibiotics from community pharmacies on your own;
Do not demand antibioticsfrom doctors. Only take antibiotics when advised by a doctor and complete the entire course of treatment, even if symptoms improve;
Follow the health advice stated on the prescription bag and adopt appropriate infection control measures, such as maintaining hand hygiene, wearing a surgical mask when having respiratory symptoms, and disinfecting and covering all wounds properly to prevent person-to-person spread of drug-resistant bacteria when taking antibiotics;
Receive seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccines to prevent secondary bacterial infections, thereby reducing the use of antibiotics and avoiding the occurrence of AMR;
Be aware of the risk of acquiring drug-resistant bacteria from RTE food. People taking antibiotics or antacids, and high-risk populations (such as pregnant women, infants and young children, the elderly and people with weakened immunity) are at a higher risk and should avoid eating raw or undercooked RTE foods; and
Observe good hygienic practices in the kitchen when handling food to minimise the risk of cross-contamination by drug-resistant bacteria.

Government launches Pilot Manufacturing and Production Line Upgrade Support Scheme and enhances existing New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme,2025-11-18 11:00,2025-11-18 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111700438.htm,"The Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC) today (November 18) launched the Pilot Manufacturing and Production Line Upgrade Support Scheme (Manufacturing+) under the New Industrialisation Support Scheme of the Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) and enhanced the existing New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme (NIAS) to further drive the development of new industrialisation in Hong Kong.

""By launching Manufacturing+ and enhancing the existing NIAS, the Government aims to promote new industrialisation and foster diversified economic development. Announced in this year's Budget, Manufacturing+ seeks to encourage local manufacturing enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises with no prior experience in smart production investment, to adopt smart production technologies and upgrade their production lines, thereby driving the development of new quality productive forces. As well, the Chief Executive announced in this year's Policy Address that the application threshold for the NIAS will be relaxed and funding would be provided on a matching basis for enterprises to employ relevant technical personnel. This will help attract more enterprises engaging in strategic industries to set up new smart production facilities in Hong Kong, driving high value-added advanced manufacturing,"" a spokesman for the Commission said.

The spokesperson continued, ""The Government will proactively leverage innovation and technology to drive high valueâadded manufacturing, promote new industrialisation, and remain committed to providing timely and appropriate support to relevant enterprises.""

Under Manufacturing+, the Government will provide funding of up to $250,000 per eligible enterprise on a 1 (Government): 2 (enterprise) matching basis to enterprises operating production lines in Hong Kong to assist them to formulate smart production strategies and introduce advanced technologies into existing production lines. The funding scope covers relevant consultancy fees, costs for purchasing equipment and integrating smart technologies into existing production lines, as well as training and development expenses. To ensure effective use of resources, Manufacturing+ will be overseen by the Committee on Technology Adoption and Production Line Upgrade, with the Hong Kong Productivity Council serving as its Secretariat.

In addition, the application threshold for the NIAS will also be relaxed, with the minimum total project cost lowered from $300 million to $150 million. Enterprises shall contribute no less than $100 million while the matching ratio of 1(Government) to 2 (enterprise) remains unchanged. Moreover, the ITC will also provide funding on a 1(Government) to 1 (enterprise) basis for companies approved under the NIAS to employ up to 10 technical personnel required for setting up or operating smart production facilities.

Manufacturing+ and the NIAS accept applications year-round. Details are available on the Innovation and Technology Fund website (www.itf.gov.hk). For enquiries, please contact the Secretariat of the schemes (Tel: 35435904; email:enquiry@itf.gov.hk)."

Speech by CE at International Forum on China's Economy and Policy 2025  (English only) (with photos/video),2025-11-18 10:17,2025-11-18 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/18/P2025111800230.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the International Forum on China's Economy and Policy 2025 today (November 18):

Honarable Doctor Zhao Zhimin (Secretary-General of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Nobel laureate Professor Joseph Stiglitz, (University Professor of Columbia University; Nobel Memorial Prize Laureate in Economic Sciences), distinguished speakers, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, and to the International Forum on China's Economy and Policy 2025.

 My thanks, first of all, to the organisers affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: the National Academy of Economic Strategy and the Chinese Institute of Hong Kong; to the co-organisers from three universities in Hong Kong; and to all the heavyweight speakers here today.

 This forum is convened by the Chief Executive's Policy Unit, which is my think tank responsible for research and engagement on long-term, strategic issues.

 It works closely with academia and other think tanks, contributing rigorous analyses and innovative ideas that enhance Hong Kong's economic resilience and ongoing vibrancy. It is precisely this mission that makes this forum so valuable to us.

 I understand that nearly 500 of you are here with us to discuss this year's theme: ""Economic Transformations in a Multipolar World"". Given today's complex global economy, it's a particularly timely topic.

 The forum, and its expert speakers, will examine the challenges facing today's global economy. It will assess China's economic strategy and the sustainable development model for regional economic co-operation. To contribute to that discussion, I would like to share three main points with you today.

 First, China, our country, is solidly on a path of high-quality development, creating a stable platform for global growth.

 In the face of the global economy's distressing instability – the rise of protectionism and unilateralism – our country continues its focus on high-quality development, achieving groundbreaking progress.

 The world's second-largest economy, our country contributes more than one-third of global economic growth. China's expanding trade and capital flows help buoy the economy of the region and the world at large. Its fundamentals remain sound, thanks to a vast domestic market and the robust policies in place to withstand external challenges.

 This year marks the conclusion of our country's 14th Five-Year Plan, and preparation for the 15th Five-Year Plan is well underway.

 The fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China concluded last month, in Beijing, setting a key objective for the next five years, among other goals, to achieve significant advancements in high-quality development, with fresh policy pledges poised to reaffirm the country as a crucial anchor of stability and a source of opportunities for the global economy.

 Second, as a part of this national endeavour, the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) is proud to contribute with its own unique advantages.

 Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having both national and global opportunities. Despite the chaos in the global economy, Hong Kong's third-quarter performance was robust, thanks to a continuing surge in exports and sustained expansion in domestic demand.

 Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy should see further solid growth, supported by sustained moderate global economic growth, vibrant financial market activity, interest rate cuts in the US (United States), a continued increase in visitor arrivals, and so on.

 In fact, Hong Kong has long shone as a resilient and resourceful economy, one of the world's most competitive in the many sectors we commit to. Confidence is getting stronger and stronger. And the world has recognised our achievements.

 This year's World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Hong Kong third in the world, up two places from last year. The Fraser Institute once again ranked Hong Kong as the world's freest economy, number one, and we placed third in the latest Global Financial Centres Index, just two points back of New York, one behind London – and tops in Asia.

 These, and other international kudos, highlight our economic strengths, long supported by the rule of law and a common law system that dovetails with most global financial hubs. That provides the critical assurances investors demand and take confidence in.

 Our determination to build on these strengths is reflected in the theme of my Policy Address this year: ""Deepening Reforms for Our People, Leveraging Our Strengths for a Brighter Future"". It serves as a roadmap for our economic progress, our pursuit of diversified development, and our determination to improve the livelihood of the people of Hong Kong. In doing so, I am confident we will accelerate our advancement from stability to prosperity.

 This brings me to my third point. Hong Kong's unparalleled advantages are not just for our own benefit – they equip us to play a critical role in global economic transformations.

 In these times of economic uncertainty, Hong Kong remains a financial harbour wide open to the world, to free and unfettered trade, thanks to our role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", building bridges for a world of mutual opportunity.

 We hold fast to the belief that free trade is the answer to boosting global output – the critical element in creating a more interconnected, productive and peaceful world economy.

 This belief is put into practice through our role as the paramount destination both for Chinese companies looking to access offshore capital and for the world seeking the Chinese Mainland's deep capital market.

 As of last year, more than 2 600 Chinese Mainland enterprises had established operations in Hong Kong. Our Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global, launched last month, will co-ordinate efforts to help mainland enterprises connect, more efficiently, with global markets and buyers, taking advantage of our world-class financial and professional services.

 As an international financial, shipping and trade centre, Hong Kong has the infrastructure and services to support international trade at the highest levels. Our ports, airports and logistics systems boost trade flow efficiency, supporting cross-boundary e-commerce and supply chains designed for the flourishing future we are surely building.

 Hong Kong, after all, is China's most internationalised city. We offer the world a market-friendly business environment, replete with business and investment advantages unmatched by any other city anywhere in the world. We are working now, proactively, to align ourselves with the 15th Five-Year Plan, fulfil Hong Kong's responsibilities and seize the plentiful opportunities there for us – for all of us.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is ready to contribute to the ""economic transformations"" you will discuss. I wish you all a rewarding forum, the best of business in the coming year, and an enjoyable stay in our Asia's world city - Hong Kong. Thank you."

Good evening. I'm very delighted to be here, tonight, for this welcome dinner of the sixth US-China Hong Kong Forum.

I would like to begin by thanking the China-United States Exchange Foundation for, once again, bringing us together. Working with the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Foundation stages this important forum to bring us together. Bring the two largest economies in the world together.

You believe, as I do- as the vast majority of the world does - that a constructive relationship between China, our country, and the United States is essential for global well-being. And for the global economy, in pursuing mutually rewarding opportunities.

As we all know, mutually rewarding opportunity is having a difficult, even daunting, year, for China-US relations.

President Xi Jinping, in his October meeting with the US President Trump, pointed out that China and the US, and I quote, ""should be partners and friends. This is what history has taught us and reality needs.""

Unfortunately, ""reality"" has often been sidelined in China-US relations today. That means that Hong Kong-US ties - a special component within the China-US relationship - are also affected, despite a US diplomatic presence here, going back more than 180 years.

The US has ensnared Hong Kong in its world-wide tariffs' web. Its self-made-up story of reciprocal tariffs for the so-called unfair, unbalanced trade in the case of Hong Kong is absolutely flawed. The US has been enjoying one of the largest bilateral merchandise trade surpluses with Hong Kong. Last year alone, the trade surplus surpassed US$ 21 billion, the second-largest among its trade partners. Over the past decade, the US has run up a trade surplus with Hong Kong worth more than US$ 271 billion, the largest among its trading partners.

America's trade with Hong Kong supports more than 140 000 American jobs, from agriculture to fashion, manufacturing and much more.

Not surprisingly, nearly 1 400 US companies were operating in Hong Kong as of last year. That makes the US Hong Kong's second-largest source of foreign-affiliated companies. That, let me add, was up 117 companies, year-on-year.

According to the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong's 2025 Business Sentiment Survey, 75 per cent, three quarters, of its surveyed members reported either stable or increased revenue last year, compared to 2023.

More than 80 000 US citizens live and work in Hong Kong, confident and comfortable in a city they share so many common values with.

They can see, for themselves, the ""one country, two systems"" principle in action, in dynamic action, how Hong Kong connects East and West, and in so many ways, for so many economies and businesses and peoples.

Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage. We boast a long and established tradition of the rule of law, a common law system shared by most global financial hubs, and a judiciary that exercises its judicial power independently, free from any interference.

Equally important, our people, and business owners, share Hong Kong's commitment to open and free trade. We are, after all, a founding member of the World Trade Organization.

The so-called ""reciprocal tariff"" for Hong Kong is therefore out of sense given that the trade balance between us is tilted heavily in favour of the US. And the fact that Hong Kong does not impose customs tariffs on goods from the US - or any other country.

Hong Kong will continue, I assure you, to do what we've always done. We champion free trade and create opportunities for local businesses and investors, and the economies, companies and investors they do business with.

With the firm support of our country, Hong Kong is fast developing its eight centres of excellence, and maintain a pivotal role in such national strategies as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. We are flush with opportunities - mutual opportunities. And in that, we continue to roll out a welcome mat for the US businesses and investors.

They can take confidence in our free trade policies, our simple and low tax regime - free from sales tax, capital gains tax, estate duty and tax on dividends - and our free flow of information, capital, goods and talent.

Speaking of talent, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development, in its 2025 World Talent Ranking, rated Hong Kong fourth in the world, and tops in Asia.

Our talent initiatives of the past three years are working. And well. Since we rolled out an enhanced talent attraction regime at the end of 2022, we have received applications from over 550 000 professionals and young talent around the world. Over 376 000 applications have been approved, and around 250 000 of them have already arrived in Hong Kong. They are graduates from top universities, high earners in their industries, technology talent, and more. They bring with them expertise, experience and, more importantly, impetus to our economy.

More than talent, Hong Kong has also proved highly attractive to a world of business. Last month, OASES, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises I set up three years ago, welcomed nearly 20 new key companies to Hong Kong, including three of the world's top pharmaceutical corporations. That takes the number of strategic companies in Hong Kong, thanks to OASES, to 102, 16 of which are, yes, American companies - more than any other overseas country.

We're pleased to have them here, creating employment, initiating R&D (research and development) projects and investing in Hong Kong's future - and theirs.

No doubt, they will also love Hong Kong's rising place as the world's East meets West centre for international cultural exchange.

In the end, ladies and gentlemen, dialogue is always better than confrontation. Collaboration is more effective than unilateralism.

But, of course, no one knows that better than the China-United States Exchange Foundation, and all of you here this evening.

Your theme for this year's two-day Forum, ""Circles for Peace"", surrounds AI (artificial intelligence), geopolitics and people-to-people ties. And I understand that some 50 prominent speakers, from all over the world, will engage those issues and their global import before an audience of some 500 strong.

Beyond this Forum, you also engage a broader, and even more diverse, audience. Thanks to the Foundation's efforts, more than 3 000 students have taken part in exchange programmes between our country and the US over the years.

And this year, the Foundation hosted the first US-China Art Dialogue in Hong Kong during Art March and the annual Art Basel art fair. Nearly 100 artists and arts aficionados from the US and China discussed how arts and artists can encourage people-to-people ties between the US and China.

In hosting inspirational events, and in many other ways, we will make it abundantly clear that global peace, and prosperity, can only be achieved through dialogue, mutual respect and leadership.

In that, China and the United States must play the leading roles.

The world also needs moderators and mediators. And I believe that Hong Kong and the China-United States Exchange Foundation have more than some experience to offer.

My thanks to the Foundation, and to the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, for once again organising this very important US-China Hong Kong Forum.

I wish you all a rewarding Forum, and a very enjoyable evening. Thank you."
Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 holds opening ceremony today to lead shipping green transitions (with photos/video),2025-11-17 22:14,2025-11-17 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700698.htm,"Hong Kong Maritime Week (HKMW) officially held its opening ceremony today (November 17). Marking its ninth edition, HKMW showcases Hong Kong's status as a leading Global Maritime Capital with quality maritime services provided by our vibrant maritime cluster amidst the theme ""Navigating to a Greener Future"" and the tagline ""Propel Hong Kong"". The seven-day HKMW 2025 hits a record-high participation number, and is expected to attract over 18 000 participants from all over the world. They collectively witnessed three highlights of today's event, including the announcement of first-batch ""partner ports"", facilitation of two industry collaboration agreements, and official establishment of the Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association.

Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025

Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said that in this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong's role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital, highlighting that Hong Kong's standing is consistently endorsed by the international community, having been ranked fourth globally as an international shipping centre for six consecutive years. Looking ahead, he expressed Hong Kong's determination to be at the forefront as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre, with a vision to become the epicenter of the global green maritime fuel trade. He called for collaboration to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping, stating that the city's policy support, expertise, strategic vision and unwavering commitment can allow it to play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of shipping. Mr Lee also witnessed the official establishment of the Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association with a group of guests, including Vice-Chairman of National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Mr C Y Leung; the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Mr Zhou Ji; Vice Minister of Transport Mr Fu Xuyin; and the Chairman of China Merchants Group, Mr Miao Jianmin.

The Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Mr Arsenio Antonio Domínguez Velasco, emphasised in his recorded speech that Hong Kong is a strategic port location and centre for maritime services, fully demonstrating that shipping is a vibrant and vital enabler of 80 per cent of world trade.

The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, spoke at the World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) 2025 Government Summit, ""We are grateful to the Central Government for its support in consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international maritime centre. The HKSAR Government will spare no effort and continue to actively promote the development of the maritime industry."" She added that the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address proposed to establish a ""Rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal transport system to extend cargo sources from the Chinese Mainland, to build ""partner port"" relationships with Belt and Road regions, to promote green shipping and digital transformation, to amend legislation for providing half-rate tax concessions to eligible commodity traders, as well as to enhance the flexibility of ship registration in Hong Kong. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its advantages as a ""super-connector"" to build a smart and green international maritime centre.

The two-day WMMF explores topics on navigating crises and pursuing sustainability in the shipping industry amidst global geopolitical and economic transformations, with sub-forums focusing on shipping markets, legal and insurance issues, port and logistics, shipping finance, and shipbuilding and repair.

Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference

The Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference (ALMAC), another anchor event of the HKMW, also commenced today. This two-day event brings together global shippers, logistics providers, and aviation stakeholders to exchange insights and explore business opportunities. The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, also officiated at the conference, and unveiled the first batch of ""partner port"", including Guangxi and Dalian of the Chinese Mainland, and San Antonio Port of Chile, which marks a significant step in further deepening the exchanges and collaboration between Hong Kong and the international maritime networks.

This year's HKMW carries special significance as it is the first-ever edition following the establishment of Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) on July 1 this year. To signify this key milestone of the Hong Kong's maritime industry, HKMPDB has, for the first time, partnered with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) to host the Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 X Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025 VIP Luncheon. Speaking at the luncheon, the Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng, said, ""With no doubt, the geopolitical tension in recent years has posed challenges to Hong Kong maritime industry. Having said that, our maritime strengths, including our city's free port status, efficient clearance process and common law system etc. continue to propel Hong Kong as a Global Maritime Capital with a large and diversified cluster of maritime-related companies.""

At the luncheon, container terminal operators in Hong Kong also signed two Memoranda of Understanding with the Western New Land-Sea Corridor and Guangxi Beibu Gulf, launching a premium sea-rail transshipment service connecting Sichuan, Chongqing, Guangxi and Hong Kong, thereby further expanding and strengthening the Comprehensive ""Rail-sea-land-river"" Intermodal Transport System, as well as enabling the flow and sharing of sea-rail transshipment cargo data between Hong Kong and Guangxi.

Several international conferences being held in Hong Kong

This year's HKMW will foster stronger connections among the global maritime trade. Returning to the stage in Hong Kong, the 2nd Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit organised by the International Chamber of Shipping concluded today, with policymakers and industry leaders gathering at the Summit to present challenges and solutions for effecting the changes under the rapid-changing global maritime trade environment. Making its debut at the HKMW, the three-day International Bunker Industry Association Annual Convention 2025 will gather global bunker leaders to discuss alternative fuels, market trends, regulatory updates, and digitalisation in bunkering. The IMO will host two seminars respectively, focusing on ship recycling and shipping energy transition. The aforesaid events collectively demonstrate the confidence of the international community in Hong Kong as a global maritime capital.

Seven-day HKMW 2025 featuring over 50 events

The seven-day HKMW 2025 will feature over 50 events hosted by more than 70 local, Chinese Mainland, and international organisations, and is expected to attract over 18 000 participants from all over the world.

The HKMPDB Flagship Session - Hong Kong: A Global Maritime Capital to be held tomorrow (November 18), will focus on green finance, legal certainty, and regional collaboration to build investable decarbonisation frameworks from the perspective of Hong Kong's maritime industry.

To spotlight Hong Kong's global maritime role and the HKMW 2025, the Transport and Logistics Bureau has partnered with Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) to produce two feature stories, which will be broadcasted on TVB Jade at around 7.30pm today and tomorrow respectively.

The HKMW 2025 is organised by the HKMPDB, with the Hong Kong Shipowners Association and the Hong Kong Maritime Museum as co-organisers, and the HKTDC and Invest Hong Kong as partners. It is also supported by 17 prominent maritime associations and 24 mainstream media outlets. For more details, please visit www.hkmw.hk."

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-11-17 21:40,2025-11-17 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700741.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (November 17) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From November 9 to 15, the CHP recorded two imported and two community-acquired LD cases. All four patients had underlying illnesses.

Imported cases
------------------

The first case involves a 69-year-old male patient who joined a package tour to Beijing from October 27 to 31 (during the incubation period). Preliminary investigations revealed that the patient's itinerary overlapped with locations visited by two imported cases announced last week. Those two cases involving a family participated in a different package tour to Tianjin and Beijing from October 26 to 30. The CHP does not rule out an epidemiological link between the three cases. The CHP is conducting genomic analysis of Legionella bacteria from the patients' samples. The CHP's investigation is in progress. The CHP has proactively contacted individuals who joined the affected package tour groups to offer health assessment and medical surveillance. No other group members have been found to have contracted LD so far. The CHP has also notified the health authorities in the Chinese Mainland of the cases and informed the Travel Industry Authority.




The second case involves a 72-year-old male patient who also travelled to the Mainland during the incubation period.


Community-acquired cases
---------------------------------

A 70-year-old male patient living in Wong Tai Sin District; and
A 69-year-old male patient living in Kowloon City District.


  The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure.

  As of November 15, 144 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

  Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

  Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

  Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.

â
  âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

Speech by CE at Hong Kong Management Association 65th Anniversary Dinner (English only) (with photos/video),2025-11-17 21:16,2025-11-17 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700700.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Hong Kong Management Association 65th Anniversary Dinner today (November 17):

Professor Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges (Chairman, Hong Kong Management Association), dear alumni, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good evening. I am delighted to be here, among you - nearly 1,000 senior Hong Kong executives - for tonight's dinner in celebrating of the Hong Kong Management Association (HKMA)'s 65 years of great work. Happy birthday for your 65th anniversary. Sixty-five years dedicated to advancing management excellence, training more than 1.3 million management executives playing pivotal roles in Hong Kong's success and continuing progress.

  Hong Kong is by a big component a servicing economy, with services accounting for more than 93 per cent of our GDP. Our strength is in the tertiary services sector, from trade and finance to professional services. That means we need talent to deliver the services that clients from around the world demand.

  That we have done and continue to do, I'm pleased and proud to say. It begins with our world-class education system. Five local universities are among the world's top 100, and Asia's top 10, in the recent QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) Asia University Rankings 2026, with the University of Hong Kong named Asia's top university.

  Our universities are also highly international, attracting top students from around the world, many of whom will remain in Hong Kong, serving our economy, and our community, after graduation.

  The percentages of non-local students in our UGC (University Grants Committee)-funded undergraduate programmes increased to 23.2 per cent in 2024/25, up four percentage points from 2022/23. In non UGC-funded undergraduate programmes, they more than doubled, from 7 per cent in 2022/23 to 18.7 per cent in 2024/25.

  And thanks to the wide-ranging talent schemes we've initiated over the past three years, Hong Kong has welcomed more than 230 000 strategic professionals and recent graduates from around the world. The Top Talent Pass Scheme's extension of stay applications have climbed as high as 55 per cent, I'm pleased to add.

  These are high-calibre professionals, mainly employed in the I&T (innovation and technology) and financial sectors. And 50 per cent of them earn a monthly income twice that of the local median income.

  I am grateful to the HKMA for its longstanding, remarkably successful work in management training. This year, the HKMA helped organise the Hong Kong International Talents Career Expo series, with the Labour and Welfare Bureau and Hong Kong Talent Engage as strategic partners. The series featured four expos between April and October, attracting more than 24 000 professionals and job seekers, along with widespread local and international media coverage.

  The HKMA's theme this year, ""Excellence • Innovation • Growth"", reflects the Government's vision for Hong Kong's long-term flourishing, as an economy and a community.

  Thanks to ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong plays a prominent role in international finance and trade. This year's World Competitiveness Yearbook ranked Hong Kong third, globally, up two spots over the previous year. And we topped the world in ""business legislation"" and ""tax policy.""

  In the Economic Freedom of the World Annual Report, recently released by the Fraser Institute, Hong Kong was once again named the world's freest economy. We also topped the ranking in ""freedom to trade internationally.""

  Hong Kong was also among the world's top three financial centres, the seventh-largest merchandise trading economy, the world's busiest air cargo hub and fourth among international maritime centres. And, yes, we finished fourth, globally, in the 2025 World Talent Ranking. Quite a year, I'd say.

  And there are more - the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster ranked first, overall, in this year's Global Innovation Index, published by the World Intellectual Property Organization. Hong Kong ranked fourth in the Swiss-based World Digital Competitiveness Ranking, released earlier this month. We ranked third, overall, in ""technology.""

  As for growth, we are dedicated to ensuring the long-term prosperity and sustainable economic development of Hong Kong. In that regard, the Government places great importance on accelerating the development of the Northern Metropolis. It will rise, soon, as a new engine for Hong Kong's economic development.

  That means installing myself as the Chair of the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis. It means streamlining workflow, removing unnecessary barriers and restrictions. It also means simplifying statutory procedures to fast-track development of the Northern Metropolis.

  The Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global, launched last month, is another priority. It's designed to smooth the way for mainland companies looking to go global. Hong Kong, thanks to our professional services prowess and our global outlook and experience, is best placed to do the smoothing.

  Earlier this month, in Shanghai, I spoke at the GoGlobal Task Force's first large-scale promotional event, highlighting Hong Kong's strengths, encouraging mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong to tap into overseas markets. The conference, I'm pleased to tell you, was well-received by the 500 participants.

  And we're just getting going, ladies and gentlemen. With GoGlobal and the Northern Metropolis, with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the Belt and Road and other national programmes. With our emphasis on creating excellence, innovation and growth for Hong Kong. For each and every one of you.

  That said, I count on the HKMA to continue your laudable and invaluable efforts in management and talent development. Speaking of which, I know that, later this evening, the HKMA's presentation ceremonies for Charter Membership and New Fellows, as well as the Hong Kong Sustainability Award, will take place.

  Allow me to congratulate the award recipients and winners, together with all who have contributed to Hong Kong's continuity of excellence and growth and development.

  I benefited from being an alumnus of HKMA. I emphasise motivation and alignment of purposes. That's what I am doing in governing Hong Kong. There is one motivation I must emphasise: you must vote. I motivate you all to vote. So that Hong Kong will be fully aligned to achieve the greater purpose of success for the benefit of all of us. Alignment means the Government, the Legislative Council, and the society, will align when we all work towards the same goal. So voting for your representative to become a legislative councillor, so that they would help reflect views, give good advice to Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government, so we will all be aligned to work for the overall good of Hong Kong. So I practise what I have benefitted from HKMA to motivate and to ensure that we are all aligned for better successes. Every registered voter should not forget to cast their ballot at the Legislative Council's General Election, taking place on December 7. By supporting this important election, you are supporting Hong Kong. Today and tomorrow. This is a civil obligation. And I thank the Chairman, Winfried, for also motivating us, so he is aligning with me, and I am aligning with him.

  Ladies and gentlemen, I know you will enjoy tonight's dinner and 65th anniversary celebration. I wish you all the best of business and business management in the coming years. Thank you. Vote!"
衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-11-17 21:01,2025-11-17 21:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700692.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十七日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十一月九日至十五日期間，中心錄得兩宗輸入及兩宗社區感染的退伍軍人病個案，四名病人均有長期病患。

輸入個案
————


首宗個案涉及一名69歲男病人，他於十月二十七日至三十一日（潛伏期內）參加一個前往北京的旅行團。初步調查顯示這宗個案與上周公布的兩宗輸入個案曾到訪的地點有重疊。上周公布涉及一家庭的兩宗個案於十月二十六日至三十日參加另一個前往天津及北京的旅行團。中心不排除三宗個案有流行病學關連。中心會對患者樣本的退伍軍人桿菌進行基因分析，調查仍在進行中。中心已主動聯絡參加涉事旅行團的人士，提供評估及醫學監察，暫時沒有發現其他團友感染退伍軍人病。中心亦已把個案通報中國內地衞生當局，並知會旅遊業監管局；
第二宗個案涉及一名72歲男病人，他於潛伏期內亦曾到中國內地。


社區感染個案
——————


一名居於黃大仙區的70歲男病人；及
一名居於九龍城區的69歲男病人。


中心仍在進行流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。

截至十一月十五日，今年錄得144宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。

創新科技及工業局局長出席「亞洲人工智能初創大賽」香港站總決賽致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-11-17 20:33,2025-11-17 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700685.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十一月十七日）在「亞洲人工智能初創大賽」香港站總決賽的致辭：

潘主席（亞洲人工智能初創大賽組委會主席、香港人工智能創新協會主席潘君宇）、陸會長（香港人工智能創新協會名譽會長、香港優才及專才協會主席陸海天教授）、各位嘉賓、各位參賽團體、各位評審、各位朋友：

  大家下午好！我很高興出席由香港人工智能創新協會主辦的第一屆「亞洲人工智能初創大賽—香港站」總決賽。香港作為比賽的第一站城市，充分彰顯了香港在建立人工智能（AI）產業生態圈、推動創科發展及國際交流等方面的綜合優勢。

二十大四中全會上月審議通過了「十五五」規劃建議，明確支持香港建設為國際創新科技中心。人工智能作為香港的關鍵產業，我們會全力推動AI發展，打造香港成為全球AI的重要樞紐。特區政府會通過「強化基礎設施、促進應用導向」的策略，推動AI技術在各行各業深度融合及加速成果轉化落地，實現「AI產業化、產業AI化」的目標。

實際上過去一年多以來，香港特區政府在吸引海內外，特別是從國內的優秀創科企業方面作出了很多的努力，也取得非常好的成績。現在在我們科學園、數碼港匯聚了近千家非常優秀的人工智能企業。剛剛我聽了各個賽道冠軍進入總決賽的參賽項目，很受啓發。我們也希望香港這個地方能夠聚集越來越多的優秀AI初創企業，所以你們今天在座各位，特區政府誠意邀請你們來香港發展。其中，我們已經預留10億元，於明年成立「香港人工智能研發院」，促進上游研發、中下游成果轉化及開拓應用場景。我們亦將優化「數碼轉型支援先導計劃」，加入AI作為合資格中小企可應用的數碼方案類別，開拓更多應用場景，以AI賦能中小企升級轉型。我們的30億元「人工智能資助計劃」，旨在鼓勵業界善用數碼港人工智能超算中心的算力資源，支撐大規模AI科研和應用，推動不同領域的創新發展和突破。

算力是推動AI發展的關鍵要素，我們需要建立自己的AI基礎設施。目前，數碼港已設立人工智能超算中心，並提供3000 PFLOPS的算力，連同其他的算力設施，目前香港的算力總規模已經達至5000 PFLOPS，但還不夠。面對持續上升的算力需求，我們需為香港算力設施長遠布局。我們正就北區沙嶺約十公頃的數據園區發展用地進行市場招標，期望以市場導向的營運模式為業界提供先進且貼近市場需要的算力設施，進一步推動香港數據及人工智能相關產業的發展，鞏固香港作為區內數字基礎設施樞紐的地位，促進數字經濟和智慧城市的發展。

這次大賽旨在發掘亞洲地區（包括香港）優秀且具創新力的AI初創企業，搭建展示和交流的平台，加速AI技術商業化，這與特區政府推動AI發展及扶持初創企業的政策方向不謀而合。大賽吸引了超過200支本地AI團隊報名參與，聚焦六大前沿領域，包括醫療健康、金融科技、智能製造、智慧城市、教育及社會創新。賽事上，各個隊伍大展身手，拼實力、拼創新，上演了一場精彩對決。我們樂見業界之間的良性互動，市場百花齊放，為香港及國家的科技發展結出更多豐碩成果。

最後，我感謝香港人工智能創新協會及各協辦機構致力籌辦這場大賽，鼎力支持本地的AI初創企業和AI生態圈發展，推動亞洲AI創新力量不斷壯大。我祝願所有參賽隊伍在賽事中獲得寶貴經驗，滿載而歸。我也希望你們盡早來香港落地發展。我亦藉此機會呼籲各位選民在十二月七日立法會選舉這個大日子，踴躍參與投票，透過你的選票，共同為香港建設更繁榮、更美好的未來。謝謝大家。"

「香港海運週2025」開幕典禮暨2025世界航商大會

行政長官李家超在開幕典禮上致辭時說，在這個複雜多變的時代，香港作為穩定可靠、充滿活力的國際航運樞紐，其角色顯得尤為重要。他指出，香港已連續六年穩居全球第四大國際航運中心，地位持續獲得國際認同。展望未來，香港將全力發展成為領先的綠色船用燃料加注中心和全球綠色船用燃料貿易樞紐。他呼籲各界攜手共建綠色航運走廊和數字貿易通道，構建安全、高效及可持續的全球航運新格局，並表示香港的政策支持、專業人才、戰略願景和堅定承擔將在引領航運業邁向新時代的進程中發揮關鍵作用。他又與一眾嘉賓包括全國政協副主席梁振英、中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任周霽、國家交通運輸部副部長付緒銀、招商局集團董事長繆建民等，共同見證香港船東互保協會正式在香港成立。

國際海事組織秘書長Arsenio Antonio Domínguez Velasco在視像致辭中提到，香港是重要的戰略性港口及航運服務中心，充分展現航運業在推動全球80%貿易中扮演着活躍且不可或缺的關鍵角色。

運輸及物流局局長陳美寶在2025世界航商大會的政府峰會專場表示：「感謝中央政府支持香港鞏固國際航運中心的地位，特區政府會積極推動航運業發展。」她續指，《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出構建「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系以拓展內地貨源、與「一帶一路」地區建立伙伴港口關係、推進航運綠色與數字化轉型、修訂法律為合資格大宗商品貿易商提供半稅優惠，以及提升香港船舶註冊的靈活度。香港將繼續發揮「超級聯繫人」的優勢，建設智慧綠色的國際航運中心。

為期兩日的世界航商大會聚焦全球地緣政治及經濟變化下，航運業如何應對危機並推動可持續發展。大會亦設有多場分論壇，涵蓋航運市場、法律與保險、港口與物流、航運金融，以及船舶建造與維修等議題。

亞洲物流航運及空運會議

海運週另一旗艦活動——亞洲物流航運及空運會議亦於今日展開，全球貨主、物流服務供應商及航空業界代表於為期兩日的會議上交流見解並探索商機。行政長官李家超亦有為會議主禮，並公布首批伙伴港口，包括內地的廣西及大連，以及智利聖安東尼奧港，為進一步深化香港與世界航運網絡的交流合作邁出重要一步。

香港海運港口發展局自今年七月一日成立後首次舉辦海運週，別具意義。為彰顯這重要的里程碑，香港海運港口發展局首次與香港貿易發展局攜手舉辦「香港海運週2025×亞洲物流航運及空運會議2025 VIP午宴」。香港海運港口發展局主席鄭慕智博士在午宴致辭時表示：「近年的地緣政治緊張局勢無疑為香港航運業帶來挑戰。然而，香港憑藉自由港地位、高效的通關流程及普通法制度等優勢，持續推動我們成為『全球航運之都』，並吸引多元化航運企業在港聚集。」

午宴上，香港港口營運商亦與西部陸海新通道和廣西北部灣港簽訂兩份合作備忘錄，以打造一條連通四川、重慶、廣西和香港的鐵海聯運精品航線，進一步拓展和加強「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，並促進港桂港口間的海鐵聯運貨物信息互聯互通。

多個國際會議在港舉行

今年的海運週將進一步加強與全球航運界的聯繫。由國際航運公會重返香港主辦的第二屆香港全球航運貿易高峰會已於今日圓滿結束，政策制定者及業界領袖齊聚一堂，深入探討急劇變化的全球航運貿易面對的挑戰和應對方案。首次於海運週亮相、為期三日的國際燃料工業協會年度大會2025將匯聚全球燃料業領袖探討替代燃料、市場趨勢、監管動向及燃料數字化等議題。國際海事組織則舉辦兩場分別聚焦船舶回收和航運能源轉型研討會。以上活動充分體現國際社會對香港作為全球航運之都的高度信任。

為期七日共主辦逾50項活動

為期七日的海運週期間，超過70個來自本地、中國內地及海外的機構將主辦逾50項活動，預計吸引來自世界各地超過18 000名參加者。

香港海運港口發展局的旗艦會議——「香港：全球航運之都」，將於明日（十一月十八日）舉行，從香港航運界角度探討綠色金融、法律保障及區域合作，推動具投資潛力的減碳框架。

CHP investigates two suspected puffer fish poisoning cases,2025-11-17 19:36,2025-11-17 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700648.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (November 17) investigating two suspected puffer fish poisoning cases, and reminded members of the public not to consume puffer fish.
  
  The first case involves two females, aged 31 and 52. They cooked and consumed at home a puffer fish that was caught by a friend yesterday (November 16). Approximately two hours later, they developed limb numbness, nausea, dizziness and generalised weakness. They sought medical attention at hospitals today and were admitted to Ruttonjee Hospital and Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital for treatment respectively.

  The second case involves a 57-year-old female, who developed limb numbness, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhoea four hours after consuming a puffer fish cooked by herself, which was bought from a sampan at the Aberdeen pier yesterday. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital today and was admitted for treatment. The CHP has referred the case to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department for follow up.

  The three patients are now in stable condition. Preliminary investigations have not found any epidemiological link between the two cases.

  The tetrodotoxin in puffer fish is a potent water-soluble neurotoxin that affects the central nervous system. It is primarily concentrated in the liver, gonads and skin of puffer fish. This heat-stable toxin does not decompose during cooking, drying or freezing.

  Tetrodotoxin intoxication can affect the respiratory and circulatory systems and may be fatal in severe cases. Currently, there is no known antidote or antitoxin to decompose tetrodotoxin. Members of the public are advised to avoid purchasing and preparing puffer fish or unknown fish for consumption to prevent tetrodotoxin-related food poisoning."
衞生防護中心調查兩宗懷疑進食河豚引致中毒個案,2025-11-17 19:36,2025-11-17 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700647.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十七日）正調查兩宗懷疑與進食河豚有關的中毒個案，並提醒市民切勿進食河豚。

首宗個案涉及兩名分別31歲和52歲的女子，她們昨日（十一月十六日）自行在家烹煮和進食由朋友捕獲的河豚，約兩小時後出現手腳麻痺、噁心、頭暈及四肢乏力。她們今日到醫院求醫，現時分別在律敦治醫院及東區尤德夫人那打素醫院留醫。

第二宗個案涉及一名57歲女子，她昨日在香港仔碼頭一艘舢舨上購買河豚，自行在家烹煮和進食，約四小時後出現四肢麻痺、頭暈、嘔吐及腹瀉。她今日前往瑪麗醫院急症室求醫，需留院治療。中心已將有關個案轉介食物環境衞生署跟進。

三名病人目前情況穩定。初步調查未發現兩宗個案有流行病學關連。

河豚帶有的河豚毒素是一種毒性強烈的水溶性神經毒素，可影響中樞神經系統。河豚毒素主要集中於河豚的肝臟、生殖腺、皮膚等器官，這是一種耐熱毒素，不會在烹煮、風乾或冷藏過程中被分解。

河豚毒素中毒可影響呼吸及血液循環系統，嚴重可能會致命。現時並沒有已知的解毒劑或抗毒素可分解河豚毒素。中心建議市民應避免購買及自行宰洗河豚或不知名魚類作膳食用途，以預防河豚毒素引致的食物中毒。"

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名67歲女子，居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月七至八日到訪廣東省深圳市，十一月十二日和十五日先後出現關節痛和發燒，昨日（十一月十六日）出現皮疹，遂到北大嶼山醫院急症室求醫，獲安排留院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人有兩名家居接觸者，與她一同到深圳市，現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得63宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，近期基孔肯雅熱疫情呈持續下降趨勢。過去一周（十一月九日至十五日）廣東省新增48宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十一月二日至八日）的107宗進一步回落。上周個案主要分布在江門市（14宗）和深圳市（12宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就日前公布一宗涉及一名住在筲箕灣東熹苑的68歲女子的本地個案，中心仍在對該病人的病毒基因進行分析工作。

中心呼籲該名患者居所一帶居民，如於十月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員和東區關愛隊已向東熹苑一帶受影響地區約3 000個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的資料單張及問卷，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於筲箕灣興東商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於東熹苑進行上門探訪，為逾4 700名市民進行評估，過去一日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為四名早前出現輕微病徵的市民進行抽血檢查，全部對基孔肯雅病毒的檢測為陰性。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 63 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, the recent outbreak of CF has shown a sustained downward trend. There were 48 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (November 9 to 15), showing a further decrease compared to the previous week (November 2 to 8), which reported 107 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Jiangmen (14 cases) and Shenzhen (12 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

Regarding the recently announced local case involving a 68-year-old female who lives in Tung Hei Court in Shau Kei Wan, the CHP is still conducting genome analysis.

The CHP urged the residents living in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 15. The CHP collaborated with the Eastern District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention and questionnaire surveys to about 3 000 households in the affected areas in the vicinity of Tung Hei Court to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

  As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 4 700 individuals through the health consultation booth on 2/F, Hing Tung Shopping Centre in Shau Kei Wan, its inquiry hotline (2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits at Tung Hei Court. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past one day. Four individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests, and all testednegative for the chikungunya virus.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生防護中心調查一宗猴痘確診個案,2025-11-17 19:00,2025-11-17 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700605.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月十七日）表示，正調查一宗猴痘確診個案，並提醒市民提高警覺，避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人士作密切身體接觸，同時強烈建議高風險目標群組人士接種猴痘疫苗。

個案涉及一名33歲男子。他於十一月九日出現皮疹，十一月十三日到衞生署油麻地男性社會衞生科診所求診。病人正於瑪嘉烈醫院進行隔離，目前情況穩定。

根據病人提供的資料，他沒有接種猴痘疫苗，於潛伏期內曾在香港有高風險接觸。中心暫未發現任何資料顯示這宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他猴痘確診個案有流行病學關連。中心正繼續就個案進行流行病學調查，會設法聯繫與他有高風險接觸的人士，並將個案通報世界衞生組織。

香港自二○二二年六月起已制定猴痘準備及應變計劃，並於同年九月出現首宗猴痘確診個案後，啓動該計劃下的戒備級別。中心實施的一系列措施（包括加強個䅁監測、接觸者追蹤、公眾教育和疫苗接種等）在過去三年有效防止猴痘在本地出現爆發。

自二○二二年起至今，本港共錄得83宗猴痘個案（67宗本地個案和16宗輸入個案），當中15宗於今年錄得，全部病人均為男性。流行病學調查顯示，絕大部分個案曾進行高風險性行為，包括與陌生人發生性行為或在沒有佩戴安全套的情況下進行性行為。香港至今未有發現新型猴痘病毒株（分支Ib型）的個案。

中心提醒高風險目標群組人士應接種猴痘疫苗，以減低感染或感染後出現較嚴重病徵的機會。此外，出現猴痘症狀（包括皮疹、發燒、發冷、淋巴結腫大、疲乏、肌肉痛及劇烈頭痛等）或懷疑自己受感染的人士應立即求醫並接受治療，不應與其他人進行可能接觸到皮疹或體液的活動。市民亦應時刻保持良好個人及手部衞生，預防經接觸傳播或感染病毒，並避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人或動物作密切身體接觸。

中心設有電話熱線（2125 2373），逢星期一至五（公眾假期除外）上午九時至下午五時運作。任何人懷疑或憂慮曾與確診病人有高風險接觸，尤其是男男性接觸者或曾與陌生人發生性行為，可致電熱線查詢及獲取相關的健康建議。

此外，衞生署為高風險群組提供接種猴痘疫苗服務，以下高風險目標群組人士可以自願形式接種猴痘疫苗：


曾進行高風險性行為，例如擁有多名性伴侶、性工作者、過去十二個月有性傳播感染史；
負責照顧猴痘確診病人的醫護人員；
處理動物傳染痘病毒的實驗室人員；及
當本港動物出現猴痘個案時有較高暴露風險的照顧動物人員。


高風險目標群組人士可於衞生署轄下全部社會衞生科診所（柴灣社會衞生科診所、灣仔男性社會衞生科診所、灣仔女性社會衞生科診所、油麻地男性社會衞生科診所、油麻地女性社會衞生科診所、容鳳書社會衞生科診所、粉嶺社會衞生科診所和屯門社會衞生科診所）及衞生署油麻地綜合治療中心接種猴痘疫苗，無須預約。

衞生署九龍灣綜合治療中心，以及醫院管理局伊利沙伯醫院和瑪嘉烈醫院的特別內科診所亦會為到診者提供猴痘疫苗接種服務。

CHP investigates confirmed Mpox case,2025-11-17 19:00,2025-11-17 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700606.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (November 17) that it is investigating a confirmed Mpox (also known as Monkeypox) case, and urged the public to be vigilant and avoid close physical contact with persons suspected of contracting Mpox. Meanwhile, high-risk target groups are advised to receive Mpox vaccinations.

The case involves a 33-year-old male. He developed a skin rash on November 9 and attended the Yau Ma Tei Male Social Hygiene Clinic of the DHon November 13. He is undergoing isolation at Princess Margaret Hospital and is currently in stable condition.

  According to the patient, he did not receive Mpox vaccination and he had a history of high-risk exposure in Hong Kong during the incubation period. No epidemiological linkages between this case and other confirmed cases recorded in Hong Kong earlier could be identified so far. The CHP is continuing its epidemiological investigations of the case and will attempt to contact individuals who were at high-risk exposure to him. The CHP will report the case to the World Health Organization.

Hong Kong has put in place the Preparedness and Response Plan for Mpox since June 2022 and activated the alert response level under the Plan after the first confirmed case of Mpox in September of the same year. The CHP has implemented a series of measures (including enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, public education and vaccination), which have been effective in preventing local outbreaks of Mpox in the past three years.

Since 2022, a total of 83 Mpox cases (67 local and 16 imported) have been recorded in Hong Kong, of which 15 cases were recorded this year. All the patients were male. Epidemiological investigations revealed that most cases had history of high-risk sexual behaviour, including having sex with strangers or without wearing condoms when having sex. Hong Kong has not yet detected any new Mpox strain (Clade Ib) cases.

The CHP reminded high-risk target groups to receive Mpox vaccinations in order to lower the risk of infection or the possibility of having more severe symptoms after infection. In addition, persons who experience Mpox symptoms (including rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion, muscle pain, and severe headaches) or suspect themselves of being infected are advised to seek medical attention and receive treatment at once. They should not engage in activities with others that may expose others to their skin rash or body fluids. Members of the public should maintain good personal and hand hygiene to prevent virus transmission or infection through contact. They should also avoid close physical contact with persons or animals suspected of being infected.

The CHP has set up a telephone hotline (2125 2373), which operates from Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm, excluding public holidays. Those who suspect or are concerned that they may have had high-risk contact with confirmed cases, particularly men who have sex with men or those who have sexual practices with strangers, can use the hotline to make enquiries and receive relevant health advice.

Furthermore, the DH provides vaccination services to high-risk groups of Mpox. The following high-risk target groups are eligible for Mpox vaccinations on a voluntary basis:


individuals with high-risk sexual practices, e.g. having multiple sexual partners, sex workers, or having a history of sexually transmitted infection within the past 12 months;
healthcare workersresponsible forcaring forpatients with confirmed Mpox;
laboratory personnel working with zoonotic pox viruses; and
animal care personnel with high risk of exposure in caseof Mpox occurrences in animals in Hong Kong.


  High-risk target groups can receive Mpox walk-in vaccinations at any of the DH's Social Hygiene Service Clinics (SocHS) (namely Chai Wan SocHS, Wan Chai Male SocHS, Wan Chai Female SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Male SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Female SocHS, Yung Fung Shee SocHS, Fanling SocHS and Tuen Mun SocHS) and the DH's Yau Ma Tei Integrated Treatment Centre.

Meanwhile, the DH's Kowloon Bay Integrated Treatment Centre and the Hospital Authority's Special Medical Clinics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital also provide Mpox vaccination services for their clients.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

大家下午好！熱烈歡迎各位蒞臨世界航商大會主論壇。今年首次舉辦政府峰會專場，非常榮幸有機會向各位介紹香港特區政府在推動航運發展的工作和部署。

感謝中央政府全力支持香港的航運業發展。二十屆四中全會剛剛通過了《中共中央關於制定國民經濟和社會發展第十五個五年規劃的建議》，明確支持香港鞏固提升國際航運中心的地位。

為了不負國家的託付和支持，我們積極推動航運業發展，包括在二○二三年及二○二四年分別發布了《海運及港口發展策略行動綱領》及《綠色船用燃料加注行動綱領》，以及於今年七月成立香港海運港口發展局，推動業界的可持續發展。

行政長官在今年的《施政報告》中提出一系列重要舉措，全力推動香港航運業繼續破浪前行。我們正全力構建「鐵海陸江」立體聯運體系，拓展貨源至國家內陸腹地。此外，我們將與內地具戰略合作意義及「一帶一路」地區建立伙伴港口關係，共同提升香港及伙伴港口的競爭力和韌性，並為建立未來的綠色航運走廊做好準備。

香港亦正全力推進綠色與數字化港口發展。我們已加注近20萬公噸綠色燃料，亦即將開始甲醇加注。數字化方面，明年初推出的港口社區系統將成為智慧港口的重要基石。系統收集的貨物數據將有助加強貿易融資，做到以貨物流打通資金流。

為鞏固香港的航運集群，更好支撐香港的高端海事服務擴展，我們將修訂法律為合資格大宗商品貿易商提供半稅優惠及提升香港船舶註冊的靈活度（包括引入雙旗註冊制度）。

再次感謝中央的支持，特區會繼續不遺餘力，建設好國家的國際航運中心。

Distinguished guests, friends of the global maritime community, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It is my great honour to address you at the Government Summit of the World Maritime Merchants Forum. I would like to extend my warmest welcome to you all, particularly those travelling a long way from all parts of the world.

Hong Kong takes pride in our long maritime history. Throughout the years, we have grown from a fishing village to a world-renowned maritime centre. Thanks not only to our excellent geographical location, but also our professional expertise, rule of law and our role as a ""super connector"" linking the East and West.

With the Central People's Government mandate to Hong Kong as an international maritime centre, we have charted new ways to empower the development of our maritime sector. As announced in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, we are establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal transport system to extend Hong Kong's cargo sources to inland of the Chinese Mainland. Additionally, we will establish ""partner port"" relationships with Mainland ports, which are of strategic collaboration significance, as well as Belt and Road regions, and prepare for the development of a green shipping corridor.

Green transformation is a major global trend in the maritime industry. Our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering promulgated in 2024 has set our measures in motion, with nearly 200 000 tonnes of liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkered this year. Digitalisation is also a vital focus for the development of the maritime industry nowadays. Our Port Community System providing real-time cargo tracking information through Hong Kong ports up to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area will be launched in two months, connecting all stakeholders in the logistics chain, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. The data collected through this system can support trade financing.

Indeed, we have drawn up a long list of tasks through which Hong Kong as an international maritime centre will grow from strength to strength. Let us work together to steer our maritime industry toward a smarter and greener future. On behalf of the Transport and Logistics Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, may I once again express my sincere appreciation for your support to the Hong Kong Maritime Week. I wish you a fruitful and rewarding week ahead. Thank you.

於二○二三至二○二四年間，入境處與內地執法部門調查人員發現多宗犯案手法相近的懷疑假結婚個案，經深入分析及調查後，鎖定一個由被捕人士為首的跨境假結婚犯罪集團。該犯罪集團透過網上買賣平台及即時通訊軟件招攬及安排香港居民與非本地居民進行假結婚而謀利。此外，犯罪集團為了招攬更多人士參與假結婚，會透過「佣金制」的方式去利誘已經參與假結婚的涉案人士，以協助集團招攬更多人士參與假結婚。每當成功安排一名人士進行假結婚後便可以賺取佣金，以鼓勵他們招攬更多人士參與非法勾當。

入境處相信，該犯罪集團於二○二三至二○二四年間共安排超過60宗假結婚，涉案金額超過港幣750萬元。連同今日行動中被捕的兩名香港居民，入境處的執法行動至今已拘捕共37人，包括18男19女，當中32名為香港居民及五名為非本地居民，被捕人士年齡介乎20至65歲。調查行動目前仍然繼續進行，入境處及內地執法部門不排除將有更多涉案人士被拘捕。

入境處一直十分關注非本地居民透過與香港居民假結婚以騙取香港居留身分的犯罪活動。入境處會繼續大力打擊任何人士透過假結婚騙取香港居留的非法活動。任何人士如以欺詐手段取得香港居民身分，將會被依法取消留港資格及身份證，涉案人士最後亦會被遣返原居地。

入境處發言人呼籲市民切勿以身試法，不要參與在任何地方登記的假結婚事宜，或在香港登記結婚時對入境處職員作出虛假申述。轉介其他人士參與假結婚亦有可能構成串謀詐騙罪行。入境處亦提醒市民，使用網上買賣平台或即時通訊軟件時需提高警覺，以免墮入假結婚集團的圈套。

根據現行香港法例，任何人士如向入境處職員作出虛假申述乃屬違法，一經定罪，最高罰款為港幣15萬元及入獄14年，協助及教唆者同罪。任何人士為促致達成婚姻或取得關於結婚的證明書或許可證，明知而故意作出虛假誓言或作出或簽署虛假聲明乃屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判處監禁七年及罰款。而干犯串謀欺詐罪行，一經定罪，最高亦可被判監禁14年。"
Cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate smashed by ImmD and Mainland authorities (with photo),2025-11-17 17:55,2025-11-17 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700522.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a joint operation codenamed ""Flashspear 2025"" with Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department on November 17. The operation successfully neutralised a cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate. During the operation, officers from the Outside Investigation Section of the ImmD raided two residential units. Two Hong Kong residents - one man and one woman, aged 43 and 57 - were arrested. The arrested persons were believed to be the mastermind and core members of the cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate. In addition, Mainland authorities arrested two syndicate members and eight Mainlanders who were suspected to have contracted bogus marriages in Guangdong.

  From 2023 to 2024, officers from the ImmD and Mainland authorities found that multiple suspected bogus marriage cases had a similar mode of operation. Following in-depth analysis and investigations, a cross-boundary bogus marriage syndicate headed by the arrested persons was identified. The syndicate used online trading platforms and instant messaging software to recruit and arrange bogus marriages between Hong Kong residents and non-local residents for profit. Furthermore, to attract more individuals to participate in bogus marriages, the syndicate incentivised those who were already involved by offering a ""commission system"", so as to assist the syndicate in recruiting more people to participate in the bogus marriage activities. With each successful arrangement of a bogus marriage, the recruiter received a commission, thereby motivating them to enlist more individuals in these illegal activities.

  The ImmD believed that the syndicate had arranged for more than 60 bogus marriages between 2023 and 2024. The estimated transaction amount involved in the cases is over HK$7.5 million. During the operation, as of today, a total of 37 persons (18 men and 19 women, aged 20 to 65), including the two Hong Kong residents arrested during the operation today, were arrested. Thirty-two of them were Hong Kong residents, and five were non-local residents. The investigation is still ongoing, and more persons involved in the case may be arrested.

  The ImmD has been concerned about non-Hong Kong residents obtaining residency by means of contracting bogus marriages with Hong Kong residents. The ImmD will continue to spare no effort in combating bogus marriages and other related illicit activities. For people who have obtained their residency in Hong Kong by fraudulent means, their Hong Kong identity card and residency status will be invalidated according to the laws of Hong Kong. They will also be subject to removal back to their place of origin.

  An ImmD spokesman urged the public not to defy the law by participating in activities related to bogus marriages anywhere or making a false oath before Immigration Officers for the purpose of procuring a marriage in Hong Kong. Those directing others to contract a bogus marriage may also be guilty of the offence of conspiracy to defraud. The spokesman also urged the public to raise their alert when using online trading platforms and instant messaging software, and to avoid falling into the trap of bogus marriage syndicates.

  Under the laws of Hong Kong, it is an offence to make false representations to Immigration Officers. Offenders are liable to prosecution and to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and the same penalties. Any person who, for the purpose of procuring a marriage or a certificate or license for marriage, knowingly and wilfully makes a false oath or makes or signs a false declaration shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to, upon conviction, imprisonment for seven years and a fine. Anyone who commits the offence of conspiracy to defraud is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years."

"Speech by CE at Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025 (English only) (with photos/video)",2025-11-17 16:30,2025-11-17 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700478.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference 2025 today (November 17):

Honourable Deputy Minister Almaz Turgunbaev (Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications, Kyrgyz Republic), Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman, Hong Kong Trade Development Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It's a great pleasure to welcome you to the 15th Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference, and to Hong Kong, Asia's logistics capital.

  A special welcome to Mr Turgunbaev, the Kyrgyz Republic's Deputy Minister of Transport and Communications. He's here to share with you the latest logistics developments, and business and investment opportunities, in Kyrgyzstan. And I am sure he's eager to hear from you, too.

  After all, some 2 300 high-profile logistics leaders and professionals from more than 40 countries and regions are here for this year's two-day conference. Here to learn more about prospects in Central Asia and the Middle East in special conference sessions. Here, too, for insight and intelligence spotlighting supply chain diversification, sustainability and green energy, innovation and technology, the low-altitude economy and much more.

  The conference theme this year, ""Collaboration and Growth in the New Trade Landscape"", is a timely response to rising geopolitical tensions and the volatile global trade policies, which present considerable challenges for our maritime, aviation and logistics industries, from route planning and shipping fleet deployment to inventory and warehouse management.

  Nevertheless, as the Chinese saying goes, ""where there are challenges, there are opportunities"". Geopolitical risks can be overcome by market diversification. Increased costs related to supply chain concerns can be offset, at least partially, by technology-enabled efficiencies.

  Hong Kong is well-positioned to weather the storm and seize new opportunities. We are an international shipping and trading centre strategically located in the heart of Asia, and a pivotal player in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. As the world's largest manufacturing base, the Greater Bay Area commands an extensive air and sea transport network.

  Hong Kong is also the world's busiest air cargo hub and one of its busiest sea ports. And I am confident we will create new and rewarding collaborations, while taking full advantage of the latest technologies to maintain the sustainable growth of our maritime, aviation and logistics sector.

  We are, for example, deepening our connections with both traditional and emerging markets. And we are exploring new opportunities in the Belt and Road countries.

  Today, I am particularly pleased to announce that Hong Kong has established Partner Port relationships with Guangxi port and Dalian port in the Chinese Mainland, and Port San Antonio in Chile. These ports are of strategic importance, and true to our character and policy priorities. As an international maritime centre, we connect the Chinese Mainland with the world and seek partners who support an open, international trade order.

  Hong Kong is also committed to building a sustainable future powered by digital and green transformation. Harnessing the power of AI, blockchain, cloud computing and other cutting-edge technologies, we are developing a Port Community System. Launching in January, it will enable real-time cargo tracking and facilitate data exchange across transport modes, boosting trade and capital flows digitally. That opens up new opportunities, from trade financing to more efficient customs declaration.

  The low altitude economy represents another promising growth area. Building on our initial regulatory sandbox pilot projects, we will introduce an advanced regulatory sandbox for complex scenarios, aimed at expanding the low altitude economy. This will facilitate its application in logistics and other innovative business sectors.

  We are also committed to Hong Kong's rise as a green maritime fuel bunkering hub. It's been a year since our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering was published. With its orderly implementation, Hong Kong is emerging as a major port offering regular commercial bunkering services for multiple types of fuel.

  Our ambitions, however, are larger than that. We are looking to build the necessary infrastructure for Hong Kong to become a global centre of trade for green maritime fuel, especially those produced in the Chinese Mainland, by far the world's biggest supplier.

  An equally green endeavour is our pursuit of ESG (environmental, social, and governance) expertise in the logistics field. In June, we published an ESG roadmap for the logistics industry, providing a clear pathway to ESG compliance. It will help strengthen the competitiveness of our logistics industry players, particularly SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), putting us at the forefront in the world's continuing pursuit of sustainability.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong has long thrived in the face of adversity. Resilience defines us as an international maritime centre and aviation and logistics hub.

  With Hong Kong as your partner, you can confidently ride the wave of opportunities this region has to offer, building strong supply chains together through our extensive business and transport networks and internationally recognised institutional strengths.

  My thanks to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for organising this year's Asian Logistics, Maritime and Aviation Conference. It is one of the two anchor events of this year's Hong Kong Maritime Week, alongside the World Maritime Merchants Forum, which also opened today and continues through tomorrow.

  Hong Kong Maritime Week runs through November 22, packed full of forums, conferences, seminars, tours, visits, receptions, and much more, all under the theme ""Navigating to a Greener Future"" - where we all want to be.

  I wish you the best of business at the conference, and a memorable stay in Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and the East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange. Thank you."

Apart from providing up-to-date statistics, this issue also contains two feature articles entitled ""Statistics on Chinese Medicine in Hong Kong, 2024"" and ""Drug Situation in Hong Kong in 2024"". Statistics presented in the ""Drug Situation in Hong Kong in 2024"" article are based on the data source from the Security Bureau, Government Secretariat.

""Statistics on Chinese Medicine in Hong Kong, 2024""

Chinese medicine has a long history in Hong Kong. The Government has been adopting a multipronged approach to facilitate the development of the Chinese medicine sector in Hong Kong. The Chinese medicine sector comprises : (a) manufacture of Chinese medicines; (b) distribution of Chinese medicines, including import/export, wholesale and retail trades; and (c) practising Chinese medicine, including Chinese medicine practitioners of general practice, acupuncture and bone-setting.

This feature article discusses the updated situation of some Chinese medicine activities including the manufacture of Chinese medicines and the distribution of Chinese medicines, as well as the external trade of Chinese herbal medicines.

For enquiries about this feature article, please contact the Distribution Services Statistics Section of the C&SD (Tel: 3903 7398; email: asw@censtatd.gov.hk).

""Drug Situation in Hong Kong in 2024""

This feature article gives an overview of the drug situation in Hong Kong in 2024 by making reference to statistics derived from the Central Registry of Drug Abuse. Moreover, statistics on the ""2023/24 Survey of Drug Use among Students"" and law enforcement on drug offences are presented. These statistics and findings provide useful information on the latest drug situation in Hong Kong, and support an evidence-based approach to the formulation of anti-drug policy and measures. The drug problem has continued to ameliorate through the concerted efforts of the government and the community. According to the Central Registry of Drug Abuse, the total number of reported drug abusers has dropped by around 40% over the past decade. However, phenomena such as increases in the reported number of young drug abusers in recent years, a high proportion of reported number of young adult drug abusers, and the involvement of young people in drug offences still warrant our attention.

For enquiries about this feature article, please contact the Statistics Unit of the Security Bureau, Government Secretariat (Tel: 2867 2753; email: sb_stat@sb.gov.hk).

Published in bilingual form, the HKMDS is a compact volume of official statistics containing about 130 tables. It collects up-to-date statistical series on various aspects of the social and economic situation of Hong Kong. Topics include population; labour; external trade; National Income and Balance of Payments; prices; business performance; energy; housing and property; government accounts, finance and insurance; and transport, communications and tourism. For selected key statistical items, over 20 charts depicting the annual trend in the past decade and quarterly or monthly trend in the recent two years are also available.

中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

CHP reminds public to take precautions during upcoming cold weather,2025-11-17 16:15,2025-11-17 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700225.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 17) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health as the temperature in Hong Kong will drop significantly.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.


  Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


âIn addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpage as well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

Mr Grimaldi (Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Mr Emanuele Grimaldi), your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, all the distinguished guests that have come to this summit today,

Good afternoon. As we bring this impactful Summit to a close, may I express my gladness seeing that our discussions in the past two days have powerfully demonstrated how our global maritime community is navigating shared challenges - from trade realignment and supply chain resilience to financing our industry’s future. These dialogues have been frank and collaborative, as to be seen from our closed-door session yesterday as well as today's sessions, reflecting our common goal and the spirit of partnership we all value. During the summit, we have heard a number of buzzwords: fragmentation, deglobalisation, protectionism, unpredictability, collaboration, partnership and most important of all - solutions.

Scene setting

In an era of volatility, isolation or unilateralism is certainly not the solution. It must be forged through partnership. The government's role is not to direct, but to enable - to build the fundamental and foundational backbone that allows the private sector to innovate, invest and thrive. This philosophy underpins our recent establishment in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) under the able leadership of the Honourable Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng Mo-chi), ensuring government and industry work as co-pilots in shaping our maritime future.

Guided by this principle and bolstered by our nation's strong support, Hong Kong adopts a clear dual strategy: reinforcing the resilience of our local maritime ecosystem, while expanding opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and in the rest of the world.

First, we are enhancing both our port competitiveness and world-class maritime services. Our port's efficiency remains a key advantage, with vessel-handling speeds nearly double the global average - earning us the ""catch-up port"" reputation. We are capitalising on this by establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal system to extend our cargo hinterland into inland provinces of the Chinese Mainland. Meanwhile, we are not only driving digital and green transformation through launching a new Port Community System for real-time cargo tracking amongst all stakeholders, we are also working, with the port operators, toward reducing our Kwai Tsing Container Terminals' carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

Complementing our port assets, we have an unparalleled cluster of over 1 200 shipping and maritime service companies, including the world's top ship managers, major protection and indemnity clubs and leading financers, as supported by one of the world’s largest fleets by gross tonnage flying the Hong Kong flag. To future-proof this leadership, we are streamlining our shipping registry procedures, enhancing tax incentives for the ship lessors and shipping commercial principals as well as introducing tax concessions for commodity traders, with legislative amendments coming right next year. Further, we will strengthen collaboration with international marine insurance organisations to upscale the training of marine insurance talents, whilst expanding the scope of the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund to cover more green energy courses, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong maritime strengths.

Secondly, we are proactively forging international partnerships to unlock new growth potential and solidify our role as a global ""super connector"". To counter protectionism, we are building partner port relationships with strategic ports in the Chinese Mainland and key Belt and Road regions for enhancing mutual competitiveness and resilience. Do expect our announcement of the first batch of our partner ports shortly later today. At the same time, central to this strategy is the Hong Kong Maritime Week itself, including the ICS World Trade Summit - our cornerstone platform for deepening international exchanges and collaboration. Every November, this gathering transforms our city into a vital nexus where global industry leaders converge to shape and drive positive changes for the future of the maritime trade. I am excited to share with you that we will be welcoming the Silk Road Maritime Association's summit one year from now during Hong Kong Maritime Week 2026, so stay tuned. This event and the week-long event will foster a strategic dialogue to unlock new opportunities in Belt and Road shipping for Hong Kong and the global community.

Despite the postponement in the IMO(International Maritime Organization)'s schedule, which we touched upon a lot during these two days, we, in Hong Kong remain steadfast in advancing our pace to strengthen and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international green maritime fuel bunkering and trading hub. Our prime location at the southern tip of China places us at the crossroads of international fairways, ideal for serving the global shipping community's bunkering needs. We rank seventh globally in shipping fuel bunkering, second in China and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Since the first LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering operation in February this year, over 200 000 metric tonnes of biodiesel and LNG have been bunkered in Hong Kong, involving a total of 13 LNG bunkering operations. Having established biodiesel and LNG bunkering, we are pioneering the next-generation fuels - including methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. We will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and mandate mass flow meters for methanol operations by next year. Further, leveraging our nation's green fuel supply advantages and Hong Kong's robust financial infrastructure, we are developing a global green maritime fuel trading centre, hosting various matchmaking events to catalyse supply chains and support our nation in reinforcing its leadership in this emerging sector.

The geopolitical landscape today affirms that the old rulebook is being rewritten. In this new chapter, Hong Kong's value proposition under ""one country, two systems"" becomes more relevant than ever after - offering a stable, sophisticated common law platform with a trusted legal framework, free flow of capital and information, as well as professional expertise that de-risks global trade. Hong Kong is here to serve and facilitate you to not just navigate today's challenges, but seize tomorrow's opportunities.

Ladies and gentlemen, while this Summit is about to conclude, I trust that the collaboration and dialogue will go on. As Hong Kong Maritime Week continues with other events, I look forward to welcoming you there.

Thank you to the ICS, our co-organisers, and all of you for your invaluable contributions. Congratulations to the ICS for, once again, hosting and staging such a successful summit this year. I wish you a productive remainder of your time in Hong Kong and enjoy the buzz and the nice weather outside of the Asia's World City. Thank you."

Honourable Vice Chairman C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (CPG) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Vice Minister Fu Xuyin (Vice Minister of Transport), Deputy Head Chen Feng (Deputy Head, Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR), Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR), Chairman Miao Jianmin (Chairman of China Merchants Group), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and to the opening of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 and the fifth World Maritime Merchants Forum, which bring together our maritime cluster, and underline Hong Kong's status as one of the world's leading maritime centres.

  The theme for the Hong Kong Maritime Week, ""Navigating to a Greener Future"", signals our shared destination. Complementing this, the theme of the World Maritime Merchants Forum, ""Steering Sustainability Through Changes"", is our navigational chart for the journey ahead.

  In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action.

  In this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong's role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of ""one country, two systems"" is the cornerstone of our success, providing us with an unshakeable foundation.

  As our country's only bilingual common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong offers a simple and low tax regime, free port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

  Our standing is consistently acknowledged, and endorsed, by the international community. For the sixth consecutive year, Hong Kong ranked fourth, globally, in the International Shipping Centre Development Index. This pays tribute to our strengths in port infrastructure, maritime services and overall operating environment.

  Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 port and maritime-related companies, a thriving cluster of global leaders in ship management, finance, insurance and law. The Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association's launch ceremony, in just a few minutes, will mark a milestone development, further enriching our maritime services and reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

  Our tax concession regime for high value-added maritime services continues to attract global businesses. And we are planning to extend half-rate tax concessions to physical commodity traders, further integrating the critical pillars of trade, commodities and shipping here in Hong Kong.

  Beyond our business-friendly foundations, our focus is firmly on the future. And the imperative for green growth is the defining challenge, and opportunity, of our generation.

  With the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework targeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in international shipping by around the year 2050, Hong Kong is determined to be at the forefront, as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre.

  Since publishing our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering a year ago, we have materialised regular commercial liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkering.

  Our vision is to become the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. And our proximity to the Chinese Mainland, the world's largest producer of green maritime fuel, is a critical advantage. We will continue to collaborate with maritime associations and business partners globally to drive the transition towards sustainability.

  Indeed, collaboration on an unprecedented scale is essential as we face challenges from geopolitical tensions, trade protectionism, technological disruption, and the climate crisis - issues too vast for any single economy to solve alone.

  Let's work together to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is ready to be your partner. Our policy support, expertise, strategic vision and unwavering commitment can play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of shipping. Together, we can steer a course towards a more sustainable, prosperous and collaborative future.

  I wish you all a rewarding Hong Kong Maritime Week, a productive World Maritime Merchants Forum, and fair winds and following seas, in business as in life. Thank you."

創新科技及工業局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-11-17 13:57,2025-11-17 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/17/P2025111700338.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十一月十七日）出席香港國際電腦會議2025開幕儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

創新科技及工業局局長：各位媒體朋友，各位市民，大家早上好。今天我很高興向大家分享一下，最近香港特區政府關於加快推進創科產業發展的情況。大家知道，國家「十五五」規劃建議明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心，特別強調科技創新與產業創新融合發展，加速建立國家的現代化產業體系。香港將會緊密對接國家的發展戰略，加速建設國際創新科技中心。

在這樣一個大的環境下，我們最近推出了幾項措施。第一項措施是在本周四（十一月二十日），我們將會公布北部都會區《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》。概念綱要主要從三部分闡述未來新田科技城產業發展的定位、產業和空間地塊的分布，以及發展模式。關於定位，大家知道我們未來新田科技城主要定位於創科產業的發展。我們將會聚焦幾大領域，包括生命健康、人工智能與機械人、微電子與智能設備、新能源、新材料及綠色科技等，主要是聚焦以先進製造為核心的香港創科產業體系的建設。在發展上，我們更多聚焦於一些產品的原型、中試產業，以及小規模生產。根據香港的特色因地制宜，也會考慮重點發展一些適合香港情況的重點創科產業。

第二項是關於新田科技城產業發展的布局。我們會根據土地推出的持續情況，分五個階段去發展未來新田科技城。具體來說，我們會提出要打造「三個樞紐」作為核心區，包括河套、洲頭和麒麟。圍繞「三個樞紐」，我們會布局產業帶。我們特別要強調產業、人才和空間的相互配合和促進，打造「產城融合」這樣一個宜居城市。第三個方面是關於發展模式。我想在發展模式方面，特區政府會遵照「有為政府」，加上「高效市場」的大原則，我們會建議成立一家「平台公司」，借助市場力量，加速發展新田科技城。

除了剛才我介紹的新田科技城的發展規劃之外，大家可能注意到上個星期我們也迎來了一個重要的里程碑，就是「創科產業引導基金」已經正式啓動基金經理的申請程序。這是本屆特區政府推出的第三個以產業發展為導向的百億元計劃。這個百億元計劃目的是通過政府適當的投資和引領，來撬動更多市場資本投資未來具策略性的創科產業，打通香港創科產業發展的「最後一公里」。基金將會聚焦於五大板塊，包括生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人、半導體與智能設備、數字化與轉型升級，再有就是未來與可持續發展。在每個板塊下，我們會設立一到數個子基金，每個子基金由普通合夥人（General Partner, GP）作為基金經理管理。政府將會作為有限合夥人，總共投資100億元到各個子基金去。過去一段時間來，我們已經成功吸引了一定數量的策略投資人加入到「創科產業引導基金」作為有限合夥人。我們也繼續邀請更多策略投資人加入到這個基金。我主要是跟大家介紹一下這兩個最近推出的重點舉措。謝謝大家。

記者：想請教剛才說新田科技城的定位是生命健康、人工智能科技，好像跟以前提過河套的定位差不多，其實將來的分布會是怎樣，會有甚麼不同？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想新田科技城的定位與河套，包括其他香港的科技園是有不同的，新田科技城主要定位於產業發展，我們發展產業。產業發展來說是重點打造以先進製造為核心的產業，希望建立起香港的創科產業體系。河套的定位主要做一些R&D（研發），也會做一些中試發展。新田科技城會提供成片土地供企業在這裏面做大規模生產，我們會做產品原型、中試，也鼓勵做一些小規模生產。另外，根據香港的特色，我們也會考慮發展幾個適合香港特色的、稍為大規模的產業。就在這點來說的話，它跟其他園區的定位是有所不同的。

記者：局長，有沒有一些例子是適合香港的產業，大概是哪些？以及剛才提到該布局分五階段，是哪五個階段？有沒有時間表？

創新科技及工業局局長：關於定甚麼樣的產業，這次這份新田科技城的規劃綱要是我們之前委託顧問團隊，過去兩年來做了周密的研究。我們走訪了40多個團體，會見了超過100個創科界的人士。根據各種統計結果，我們提出了幾大產業分布，就剛剛我提到的，包括生命健康、機械人、人工智能、新材料、新能源等等。這都是認為是可能適合香港未來發展的方向。具體最終哪幾個方向能夠做得更好，下一步還要聽市場的反饋。所以，下一步我們會重點考慮要引入一些龍頭企業，通過龍頭企業的引入能夠帶動上下游的發展。關於你說的五個發展期是怎麼定的，我想這主要是根據我們未來收地的程序，再有就是根據我們產業進駐的情況。我們大概提出了五個階段，當然也可能在未來的發展中會根據情況做一些調整。總而言之，我們希望未來能夠加速發展，能夠通過新田科技城匯聚全世界的創科資源到這個地方。

記者：有沒有時間表大概第一階段是何時？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想具體的時間，馬上周四，我們會公布這樣一個規劃概念綱要的詳細情況，我想到時候可以參閱。

記者：最後想問發展模式是否傾向公私營合作？之前《施政報告》提過的直接批地是否方向之一？

創新科技及工業局局長：我想發展模式主要爭取「有為政府」加上「高效市場」這大原則，我們會提出建立一個「平台公司」，「 平台公司 」可以參考比如現在科學園或者數碼港這樣的形式。一方面加強政府的引領，保證長期的規劃，同時要充分借助市場的力量、市場的資源、市場的開發速度和效果。這樣的話，我們希望能夠政府與市場相結合，能夠高速度、高質量的快速建立起新田科技城的創科產業。謝謝大家。"
