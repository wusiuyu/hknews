民政及青年事務局局長在立法會《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》委員會會議開場發言全文（只有中文）,2025-07-11 11:58,2025-07-11 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100327.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（七月十一日）在立法會《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》委員會的開場發言全文：

主席、各位委員：

我和同事今日出席法案委員會會議，向各位簡介《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

​首先，我希望強調制定《條例草案》的政策背景。正如我多次強調，政府一貫的政策是不鼓勵賭博。針對賭博問題，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括透過執法打擊非法賭博活動、透過公眾教育宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害、為有需要人士提供輔導和支援服務。而最後一項措施是透過法例規管賭博活動。政府提供合法賭博途徑的目的，只在於回應市民對某些賭博活動的需求，以免他們轉向非法的經營者下注。政府在今年四至五月期間進行的公眾諮詢結果也顯示，規管籃球博彩獲得大部分回應者支持。

《條例草案》參考現時賽馬和足球博彩的模式，賦權民政及青年事務局局長發出籃球博彩牌照，並定立牌照規限，以減少賭博對市民，尤其是青少年的不良影響。《條例草案》亦沿用現行足球博彩稅的計算和徵收方法，即向舉辦商徵收淨投注金的50%作籃球博彩稅，以及修訂博彩及獎券事務委員會的職能以涵蓋籃球博彩牌照的相關事宜。

若《條例草案》獲得通過，我們將向香港賽馬會發出單一籃球博彩牌照，此舉可避免因經營者互相競爭而刺激對賭博的需求。

主席，我明白不少議員和市民都關注規範籃球博彩是否會刺激賭風或加重沉迷賭博的問題。正如我早前在立法會二讀發言時強調，政府非常重視預防與賭博相關的問題，尤其是涉及對青少年的影響。

在預防青年沉迷賭博問題方面，我們會進行兩方面的重點工作，首先是施加嚴謹的法律與規管約束，以減少賭博對市民的不良影響；以及通過平和基金提供輔導、治療服務、教育和宣傳活動，以提升公眾對沉迷賭博禍害的認識。

其中，雖然青少年參與賭博的比例在過去多年一直維持在低水平，我們仍會增撥資源，在現時資助的四間輔導中心以外，設立專注於為青少年提供輔導及支援服務的新中心，向青少年樹立正確的法律觀和價值觀，特別是通過公眾教育提醒青少年，參與非法賭博，向非法收受賭注者投注已屬違法。

主席，《條例草案》將規管籃球博彩活動，以打擊非法賭博。我希望各位委員能夠支持《條例草案》，讓我們早日落實相關的規管制度。

結束發言前，我希望作兩點技術說明，希望可協助委員會在處理《條例草案》的條文時，能更有效率。第一，我們早前提交的立法會參考資料摘要除《條例草案》外，也提及馬會增加轉播境外賽馬博彩活動的建議。增加轉播境外賽馬次數按現時賽馬博彩牌照中的條款進行，並不涉及法例修訂。過往增加轉播境外賽馬次數時也有通報立法會，這次是按既定做法進行，所以這並非今次《條例草案》審議過程的一部分。

第二，《條例草案》廢除了與二○一三年至二○一六年就徵收境外賽馬博彩稅安排的條文。該等條文與當時的保證款額有關，已在二○一六年後失效。我們通過《條例草案》將刪除這些過時條文。這些修訂不涉及政策轉變。

接下來，我和我的同事均樂意解答議員的提問。多謝主席。"

Gazettal of two pieces of subsidiary legislation under Copyright Ordinance,2025-07-11 11:00,2025-07-11 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100258.htm," The Government today (July 11) published in the Gazette two pieces of subsidiary legislation under the Copyright Ordinance (Cap. 528) (the Ordinance), namely the Copyright (Libraries, Museums and Archives—Prescribed Conditions for Making Copy) Regulation and the Copyright (Specified Libraries, Museums and Archives under Sections 47 to 53) Notice.

 The above two pieces of subsidiary legislation are made under section 46(1) of the Ordinance. They aim to specify libraries, museums and archives and prescribe conditions for certain permitted acts for use of copyright works, and at the same time replace the Copyright (Libraries) Regulations (Cap. 528B) currently governing some of the relevant permitted acts.

 A spokesman for the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said, ""The Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2022 (the Amendment Ordinance), which came into operation on May 1, 2023, not only has strengthened copyright protection in the digital environment, but also maintained a proper balance between copyright protection and reasonable use of copyright works. The Amendment Ordinance has introduced and expanded the permitted acts for specified libraries, museums and archives to facilitate their reasonable use of copyright works in their collections during daily operations, promoting research, private study, as well as knowledge dissemination and preservation of historical and cultural heritage. Therefore, it is necessary to update the relevant subsidiary legislation to facilitate the above.""

 The spokesperson added that the Government had earlier conducted a public consultation on the legislative proposals for the two pieces of subsidiary legislation and had carefully considered and taken on board the views of stakeholders. The proposals will provide specified libraries, museums and archives with a statutory framework which is clear and complies with the Ordinance, thereby enabling them to more effectively perform and fulfil their functions in education and the inheritance of knowledge and culture.

 The two pieces of subsidiary legislation will be tabled before the Legislative Council on July 16 for negative vetting. Upon completion of the relevant legislative procedures, the Government will carry out publicity and educational activities to enhance the awareness of the relevant provisions among the specified libraries, museums, archives and their users, and to enable the relevant stakeholders to get fully prepared before the two pieces of subsidiary legislation come into effect on January 1 next year."
Import and Export (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 gazetted,2025-07-11 11:00,2025-07-11 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100260.htm," The Government published the Import and Export (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 (Amendment Ordinance) in the Gazette today (July 11) to make technical amendments to the Import and Export Ordinance (Cap. 60) and related legislation, so as to replace the existing Government Electronic Trading Services (GETS) by the Trade Single Window (TSW) upon rollout of TSW Phase 3 as the electronic platform for submission of specified trade documents.

 A spokesman for the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau said, ""We are grateful to the Legislative Council for passing the relevant bill to provide the legal basis for the implementation of TSW Phase 3, achieving another important milestone on trade facilitation. The TSW not only overhauls and enhances the document submission workflows between participating government agencies and the trade, but also enhances the efficiency of cargo clearance in Hong Kong and helps consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international trade centre and a logistics hub. The Government is pressing ahead with the development and testing of the information technology (IT) system of TSW Phase 3, with the target of rolling out the services by batches from 2026 onwards.""

 The Government is implementing the TSW in three phases to provide a one-stop electronic platform for the trade to lodge business-to-government trade documents for trade declaration and cargo clearance. Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the TSW have been in full service since 2020 and 2023 respectively, covering 42 types of trade documents in total. Phase 3 is the final and most complex phase of the TSW. It involves a large volume of documents submitted by a wide range of stakeholders, covering Import and Export Declarations (TDEC), cargo information required to be submitted under different transport modes (including Advance Cargo Information, Cargo Manifests and Cargo Reports), and applications for Certificates of Origin and Dutiable Commodities Permits. The IT system of Phase 3 will replace the long-established GETS and major cargo clearance systems of the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), and the trade will be required to use the TSW to submit relevant trade documents.

 Features of Phase 3 include:

trade members may submit trade documents via the TSW on their own or authorise value-added service providers to submit and verify information of trade documents and make payment on their behalf;
trade members can submit pre-shipment TDEC and Cargo Manifests via the TSW on a voluntary basis; and
trade members may submit road Cargo Manifest and return licences through electronic means, thereby saving operating cost.


 To provide sufficient time for the trade to migrate to the new system, the Amendment Ordinance has included provisions on transitional arrangements to allow parallel run of TSW Phase 3 and GETS for a certain period of time. The C&ED will also launch a series of publicity, promotion and training programmes and provide support services prior to the rollout of Phase 3 services to ensure a smooth transition for the trade.

 The main provisions of the Amendment Ordinance come into operation today, except for some provisions relating to the deletion of the existing legal framework of GETS, which shall take effect on a day to be designated by the Commissioner of Customs and Excise by notice published in the Gazette."

《2025年進出口（修訂）條例》刊憲,2025-07-11 11:00,2025-07-11 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100261.htm,"政府今日（七月十一日）在憲報刊登《2025年進出口（修訂）條例》（《修訂條例》），對《進出口條例》（第60章）及相關法例作出技術修訂，讓「貿易單一窗口」（「單一窗口」）第三階段推出後，取代現有的「政府電子貿易服務」作為提交指定貿易文件的電子平台。

商務及經濟發展局發言人表示：「我們感謝立法會早前通過有關條例草案，為落實『單一窗口』第三階段提供法律基礎，實現貿易便利化一個重要里程碑。『單一窗口』既全面更新並完善參與的政府部門與業界之間提交文件的工作流程，亦提升香港的貨物清關效率，有助鞏固香港作為國際貿易中心和物流樞紐的地位。政府正全力推進『單一窗口』第三階段資訊科技系統的開發及測試工作，目標是在二○二六年起分批推出服務。」

政府分三階段實施「單一窗口」，提供一站式電子平台供業界提交「企業對政府」的貿易文件作報關及貨物清關之用。第一及第二階段已分別於二○二○年及二○二三年全面投入服務，共涵蓋42類貿易文件。第三階段是「單一窗口」最後及最複雜的階段，涉及廣泛持份者提交的大量文件，涵蓋進出口報關單、在不同運輸模式下所需提交的貨物資料（包括預報貨物資料、貨物艙單及貨物報告），以及產地來源證與應課稅品許可證的申請。第三階段的資訊科技系統將取代沿用多年的「政府電子貿易服務」及香港海關多個主要貨物清關系統，屆時業界必須使用「單一窗口」提交相關貿易文件。

在第三階段的特點包括：

業界可自行透過「單一窗口」提交貿易文件，或授權增值服務提供者代其提交和核實貿易文件資料及繳費；
業界可自願選擇在貨物付運前經「單一窗口」提交進出口報關單及貨物艙單；及
業界可以電子方式提交道路貨物艙單及回證，減省營運成本。


為讓業界有足夠時間過渡至新系統，《修訂條例》已加入過渡安排的條文，容許「單一窗口」第三階段與「政府電子貿易服務」並行一段時間。香港海關亦會在第三階段服務推出前，進行一系列宣傳、推廣及培訓活動和提供支援服務，確保業界能夠順利過渡。

除了部分與刪除現行「政府電子貿易服務」法律框架相關的條文將於海關關長以憲報公告指定的日期起實施外，《修訂條例》的主要條文即日生效。"
《版權條例》兩項附屬法例刊憲,2025-07-11 11:00,2025-07-11 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/11/P2025071100259.htm,"政府今日（七月十一日）在憲報刊登《版權條例》（第528章）（《條例》）兩項附屬法例，分別為《版權（圖書館、博物館及檔案室——製作複製品的訂明條件）規例》及《版權（第47至53條所指的指明圖書館、指明博物館及指明檔案室）公告》。

上述兩項附屬法例根據《條例》第46（1）條訂立，旨在指明某些使用版權作品的允許作為所適用的圖書館、博物館和檔案室，以及就該等允許作為訂明條件，同時取代現時規管部分相關允許作為的《版權（圖書館）規例》（第528B章）。

商務及經濟發展局發言人表示：「二○二三年五月一日生效的《2022年版權（修訂）條例》（《修訂條例》）除了加強數碼環境的版權保護外，亦在版權保護和合理使用版權作品之間維持合適的平衡。《修訂條例》新增和擴闊為指明圖書館、博物館及檔案室而設的允許作為，以便利它們在日常運作中合理運用其藏品中的版權作品，促進研究、私人研習，以及知識傳播和歷史文化作品遺產保存。因此，我們有需要相應更新有關附屬法例以作出配合。」

發言人續說，政府較早前就兩項附屬法例的立法建議諮詢公眾，並仔細考慮和吸納持份者提出的意見。建議將為指明圖書館、博物館及檔案室提供一套清晰且符合《條例》的法定框架，有助它們在教育、知識文化傳承中更有效履行及發揮其職能。

兩項附屬法例將於七月十六日提交立法會，進行先訂立、後審議的程序。相關立法程序完成後，政府會進行宣傳及教育活動，提高指明圖書館、博物館、檔案室及其使用者對相關條文的認識，也讓相關持份者能在兩項附屬法例於明年一月一日生效前充分準備。"

《條例草案》旨在設立同性伴侶關係登記制度，讓同性伴侶可申請登記其同性伴侶關係。《條例草案》的内容涵蓋同性伴侶關係登記辦事處的設立、同性伴侶關係的登記條件、申請和撤銷登記的方式，以及與登記機制相關的罪行及罰則。《條例草案》亦對某些成文法則作出相應修訂，以制定承認同性伴侶關係而伴隨的權利和責任。

政府發言人表示：「政府尊重法庭裁決並會積極履行《人權法案》第十四條的相關義務，因此進行立法以制定相關替代框架。而目前的建議做法已充分考慮香港的實際情況和整體利益，並力求取得適當平衡。政府會繼續積極與立法會密切溝通以推展《條例草案》的落實工作。我們重申今次制定替代框架設立同性伴侶關係登記制度並不會動搖政府對維護一夫一妻、一男一女婚姻制度的一貫立場。」

《條例草案》將於七月十六日提交立法會進行首讀。"

The Bill aims to establish a registration system for same-sex partnerships, so that same-sex partners can apply for registration of their same-sex partnerships. The content of the Bill covers the setting up of a same-sex partnership registry, the conditions for registration of same-sex partnerships, the mode of application for registration and revocation of registration, and the offences and penalty related to the registration mechanism. The Bill also amends related provisions in certain enactments to provide for rights and obligations attendant on the recognition of same-sex partnerships.

A spokesman for the Government said, ""The Government respects the court's judgment, and will proactively fulfil the related obligation under BOR14 by establishing the relevant alternative framework through legislation. The current proposal has fully taken into account the actual situations and overall interests of Hong Kong, and strived to achieve an appropriate balance. The Government will continue to actively maintain close communication with the Legislative Council (LegCo) to implement the Bill. We reiterate that establishing the alternative framework to introduce a registration system for same-sex partnerships will not compromise the Government's established position on upholding the monogamous and heterosexual marriage system.""

The Bill will be introduced into the LegCo for first reading on July 16."

The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

 The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the relevant duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

 To protect workers' safety, the LD reminds contractors to take suitable safety measures, including providing substantive support to the structures being dismantled to prevent them from accidental displacement or sudden collapse, fencing off the area for dismantling work and implementing control measures to prevent any unnecessary persons from entering fenced-off areas.

 The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

 In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident concerned to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

 The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

 For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."

尊敬的徐瑩會長（香港大灣區圍棋促進會會長）、潘雲東副特派員（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、李曙光副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部副部長）、熊方軍副主席（中國圍棋協會副主席）、何建輝副局長（深圳市文化廣電旅遊體育局副局長）、屈華民院長（香港科技大學跨學科學院院長）、各位嘉賓、各位同學：

大家晚上好！我很高興再次出席「四洲杯」香港國際大學生圍棋公開賽的開幕儀式。今年已是「四洲杯」第三屆的賽事，連續舉辦這賽事證明市民大眾對圍棋的熱情正在不斷上升，也很感謝舉辦單位為舉辦賽事而作出的努力。

圍棋是中華民族的偉大發明，有着四千多年的悠久歷史，是中國傳統思想文化的精髓，也是人類歷史上最悠久的其中一項棋藝運動。

圍棋看似簡單，十字方格的棋盤，黑白兩色的棋子，相互攻守，但卻蘊含着複雜高深、變幻莫測的戰略思想、辯證思維和邏輯推理。圍棋既是競技，也是科學與藝術，既需要謀略、布局和技巧，同時也十分講究棋手的心理素質、品德和意志。

國家主席習近平表示：「圍棋中包含着人生的哲學和世界戰略。」這句話正好總結了圍棋的高深智慧，更啓導着我們必須以冷靜、細心、靈活、全局、長遠的態度去看待事情，並在平等、開放、和諧、互重、循規的競爭中力求進步。

圍棋是中華文化的精粹和代表性項目，更是中華民族對世界文明的一大重要貢獻。我特別感謝香港大灣區圍棋促進會每年不辭勞苦主辦香港國際大學生圍棋公開賽，並感謝香港科技大學支持比賽和提供場地。

這個比賽一方面向香港年青人推廣棋藝和中華優秀傳統文化，同時讓不同地區的圍棋愛好者一起展示才華、交流技藝和增進友誼，更推動這項中國文化國粹走向世界，說好中國故事。

今年的賽事依然極具代表性，邀請到來自內地、中國香港、中國澳門、中國台灣、日本、韓國以至東南亞地區共19支隊伍參加。在為期兩天的賽程中，這些隊伍將進行六輪賽事，在棋盤上展開智慧與耐性的較量。我祝願各位圍棋選手都盡展所長、旗開得勝！

各位，特區政府一直致力在香港社會弘揚愛國主義精神，傳承中華優秀傳統文化，加強市民對國家的歸屬感和自豪感。透過去年成立的「愛國主義教育工作小組」，我們致力在特區構建以弘揚愛國愛港為核心、同「一國兩制」方針相適應的主流價值觀，讓愛國主義扎根香港，厚植家國情懷。

經過這一年多的努力，工作小組已按香港的實際情況，積極採取了多項措施廣泛推廣愛國主義教育，包括在去年國慶75周年、巴黎奧運會以及今年東江水供港60周年等大日子組織推出豐富多元的慶祝紀念活動，在社會營造熱烈的愛國氛圍；而數天之前剛訪問香港的國家第一艘完全自主設計、自主建造、自主配套的航空母艦山東艦編隊，以及今年稍後的抗戰勝利80周年和粵港澳三地共同承辦的第十五屆全國運動會，都是我們今年推進愛國主義教育的重點工作。

此外，特區政府在去年也成立了弘揚中華文化辦公室，加強市民特別是青年人對中華文化精髓的了解和體會，從而增加大家對國家的認同感和文化自信。由特區政府舉辦的「中華文化節」正在盛大舉行，透過音樂、舞蹈、戲劇、戲曲、電影及展覽等多樣形式，展示中華優秀傳統文化的無窮魅力，推動中華文化深入走進社區。

各位，香港是中外文化藝術交流中心，也是中西文化薈萃的國際大都會。我們會繼續把握好香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要角色，發揮好香港中西文化交流的重要窗口橋樑作用，不斷深化國際交往合作，並提升中華文化在世界上的感染力和影響力。

最後，我祝願第三屆「四洲杯」香港國際大學生圍棋公開賽圓滿舉行，各位同學學業進步、棋藝精進、前程錦繡！各位嘉賓工作順利、家庭幸福！

謝謝大家！"

The event gathered around 100 representatives from Dutch and European business leaders, and Hong Kong representatives to exchange insights on key sectors under the theme.

Speaking at the event, the Special Representative for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Affairs to the European Union, Ms Shirley Yung, highlighted the resilience of Hong Kong's economy amid global challenges. She emphasised, ""Under the 'one country, two systems' principle, Hong Kong has maintained a solid institutional foundation of the rule of law, independent judiciary, robust regulatory regime, a low and simple tax system, and free flow of people, goods, capital and information, and has remained a trusted gateway to Asia and a market for global capital.""

Ms Yung cited Hong Kong's rankings in a number of recent surveys as one of the world's top three international financial centres, among the top three in global competitiveness, the freest economy in the world, and home to five universities ranked in the world's top 100.

She further underlined that financial services remain a pillar of Hong Kong's economy. She remarked, ""Our deep capital markets, efficient banking system, and strong legal and regulatory infrastructure provide an ecosystem in which businesses from around the world can thrive. We are also embracing the future through fintech innovation.""

Ms Yung also updated the audience on Hong Kong's latest efforts to refine financial regulation to balance innovation with investor protection, including the recent completion of legislation on stablecoins. She also discussed Hong Kong's leading role in green and sustainable bond issuance in Asia.

The NHKBA annual summer event concluded with networking sessions and engaging discussions on how Dutch and European enterprises can benefit from Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" between Europe, Asia, and China. The evening culminated in a dinner reception, at which the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, spoke on Hong Kong's distinctive advantages of enjoying strong support from the motherland while being closely connected to the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle."

翁佩雯提及香港在近期多項調查中的排名，包括全球三大國際金融中心之一、全球競爭力排名前三、全球最自由的經濟體，並且有五所大學躋身世界百強。

Commissioner of Customs and Excise visits Urumqi Customs and attends launching ceremony of Fuzhou Customs District's Fujian-Guangdong-Hong Kong Single E-lock Scheme (with photos),2025-07-10 19:15,2025-07-10 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/10/P2025071000805.htm,"âThe Commissioner of Customs and Excise, Mr Chan Tsz-tat, yesterday (July 9) completed his four-day visit to the Urumqi Customs District and the Fuzhou Customs District. He attended the launching ceremony of the Fuzhou Customs District's Fujian-Guangdong-Hong Kong Single E-lock Scheme during his visit.

During July 6 to 8, Mr Chan visited the Urumqi Customs to meet with the Director General in the Urumqi Customs District, Mr Hao Weiming. The two exchanged views on the promotion of Hong Kong's economic and trade ties and exchanges with Xinjiang, as well as the exploration of co-operation opportunities and enhancement of collaboration between the two sides. Mr Chan also visited the Urumqi International Land Port, the Operation Monitoring and Inspection Control Centre of the Urumqi Customs District, and the Kalasu Ground Crossing to learn more about the intelligent cargo monitoring and customs clearance process of the China-Europe Railway Express in Urumqi. He expressed hope that both sides could reinforce the complementary strengths of the country's southern and western gateways to contribute to the stability of the supply chain between Asia and Europe in the future.

During the visit, Mr Chan and the Vice Chairman of the People's Government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Mr Zhu Lifan, toured the Khunjerab Ground Crossing Gateway, which is under the Urumqi Customs and has an altitude reaching 5 100 metres, to understand its significance in safeguarding the smooth operation of the China-Pakistan economic corridor and national security. They also discussed issues of mutual concern. Afterwards, they visited the Shuibulanggou Party Spirit Education Base.

Yesterday, Mr Chan went to Fuzhou to continue his visit and attended the launching ceremony of the Fujian-Guangdong-Hong Kong Single E-lock Scheme in Fuzhou Customs. Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Chan said that the official launch of the first Customs clearance point of the Scheme in Fuzhou Customs will help further promote interconnections and the flow of goods between Fujian, Guangdong and Hong Kong, marking a new breakthrough in clearance facilitation and co-operation between Mainland and Hong Kong Customs. Meanwhile, Mr Chan said he hopes that the extension of the Scheme to Fuzhou Customs would enhance the efficiency of cross-boundary intermodal transportation, bring Fuzhou's various products to overseas markets, and consolidate and strengthen Hong Kong's status and competitiveness as an international maritime centre, international aviation hub and international logistics hub, creating a win-win situation for trade between the two places.

At the event, the first transportation truck carrying transshipment goods departed from the first clearance point in Fuzhou Customs District through the Scheme, and arrived at Hong Kong International Airport via the Shenzhen Bay Control Point this morning (July 10), where the goods were transshipped to overseas destinations. Fujian-Guangdong-Hong Kong Customs could streamline the clearance process and expedite the flow of cargo transshipments by reducing duplicated inspections of the same consignments under the Scheme.

In Fuzhou, Mr Chan also separately met with member of the Leading Party Members Group of Fuzhou Municipal People's Government Mr Zhang Fan; the Deputy Director General of the Guangdong Sub-Administration of the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China, Mr Feng Guoqing; and the Deputy Director General in the Fuzhou Customs District, Mr Lin Yuefei. He expressed his gratitude for their dedicated support and co-ordination in extending the Scheme to Fuzhou Customs District, and had discussions on leveraging opportunities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development and deepening co-operation.

Following Xiamen Customs District, Fuzhou CustomsDistrict is the second Customs District to implement the Scheme in Fujian Province. Hong Kong and Mainland Customs will continue to proactively expand the Single E-lock Scheme by establishing more clearance points in both places, and plan to extend the Scheme to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to attract more cargoes to Hong Kong for transshipment and increase the competitiveness of Hong Kong's shipping and logistics sector."

行程期間，他與新疆維吾爾自治區人民政府副主席朱立凡一同參觀烏魯木齊海關轄下，海拔高度達5 100米的紅其拉甫口岸國門，了解其守護國家與巴基斯坦經濟走廊暢通及國家安全的重要性，並探討雙方共同關注的議題。其後，他們到紅其拉甫海關水布浪溝愛國主義教育基地參觀。

陳子達昨日轉往福州繼續訪問行程，並出席福州關區閩粵港「跨境一鎖」快速通關模式首發活動。陳子達致辭時指，福州關區正式開通首個「跨境一鎖」清關點，有助進一步推動閩粵港互聯互通和貨物便捷流動，也標誌着內地與香港海關在通關便利合作上取得新突破。同時，他期望計劃擴展至福州關區後，能夠提升跨境物流多式聯運的效率，讓福州的各式產品進一步走向國際，同時鞏固及提升香港作為國際航運中心、國際航空樞紐和國際物流樞紐的地位和競爭力，創造兩地貿易雙贏局面。

活動當日，首輛載有轉口貨物的運輸車輛透過「跨境一鎖」從福州關區的首個清關點出發，並於今日（七月十日）上午經深圳灣管制站抵達香港國際機場並轉運貨物往世界各地。在計劃下，閩粵港海關減少對貨物的重複查驗，加快清關效率和簡化貨物轉關流程。

福州關區是繼廈門關區後第二個在福建省實施「跨境一鎖」的關區。香港和內地海關將繼續積極擴展「跨境一鎖」計劃，在兩地設立更多清關點，並正籌備把計劃延伸至廣西壯族自治區，吸引更多貨物來港中轉，提升香港的航運物流競爭力。"

Five persons were arrested in the operation.

  Customs earlier received information alleging that suspected counterfeit medicines and proprietary Chinese medicine were on sale in shops. After a comprehensive investigation and with the assistance of the trademark owners, Customs officers took enforcement action yesterday and raided four retail shops in Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui and Sheung Shui. The batch of suspected counterfeit goods, including medicines, proprietary Chinese medicines, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare products was seized. With the assistance of officers from the Department of Health, Customs also seized the batch of suspected controlled medicines at the four above-mentioned shops which do not have drug dealer licences.

During the operation, four men and one woman, aged between 29 and 48, were arrested. They comprised one company director and four salespersons.

An investigation is ongoing and the likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

Customs will continue to step up inspections and enforcement, and stringently combat the sale of different kinds of counterfeit goods.

Customs reminds consumers to procure goods at reputable shops and to check with the trademark owners or their authorised agents if the authenticity of a product is in doubt. Traders should also be prudent in merchandising since selling counterfeit goods is a serious crime and offenders are liable to criminal sanctions.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who sells or possesses for sale any goods with a forged trademark commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance, any person who possesses any poison included in Part 1 of the Poisons List other than in accordance with provisions commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."

The works for Phase 1 development are subdivided into two stages, with an area of about 158 hectares for Stage 1 works and about 207 hectares for Stage 2 works. The Stage 1 works commenced late last year. As previously stated publicly, the Government will not carry out pond filling works before commencing works for SPS WCP in 2026/2027.

The works of SPS WCP (First Phase) covering an area of about 150 hectares will commence in 2026/2027 (including the abovementioned proposed acquisition of land of about 85.2 hectares) for completion in 2031. The park serves multi-functions to conserve the Deep Bay wetlands, facilitate the modernisation of the aquaculture industry, as well as create environmental capacity and compensate for the impact on ecology and fisheries resources. The entire park is expected to be completed by 2039 to align with the estimated time for full operation of the STT."

The seminar was attended by over 250 business representatives from Hong Kong and a number of Mainland cities.

  In her opening remarks, the Commissioner for the Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Ms Maisie Chan, said that the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area states that to fully leverage the advantages of Hong Kong in IP protection and related professional services, and support the development of Hong Kong as a regional IP trading centre, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has rolled out a series of policies, including the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme, to promote the transformation and commercialisation of research and development outcomes, the introduction of the ""patent box"" tax incentive to alleviate the tax burden on enterprises and the expansion of the original grant patent system to cover frontier fields such as AI. The HKSAR Government also promotes the creation and trading of creative IP through the CreateSmart Initiative, as well as capitalising on Hong Kong's unique advantage of being connected to the Mainland and the world to establish Asia's first cross-border IP licensing platform, the Asia IP Exchange portal, which facilitates efficient trading of cultural and creative IP in the international markets.

  Today's seminar featured keynote speeches by three distinguished experts, who introduced the IP systems in Hong Kong and the Mainland from a practical perspective, as well as the support provided by the IP professional services sector in Hong Kong to enterprises exploring global markets. The seminar also arranged two roundtable discussions with six corporate IP executives who shared their strategies and successful experiences in transforming various forms of IP into commercial value.

  After the seminar, Ms Chan remarked that today's event attracted a large number of participants and fostered lively discussions, fully reflecting the industry's strong enthusiasm for the effective use of IP rights to generate economic benefits and foster the development of the national and international dual circulation economy. Hong Kong will continue to strengthen its function as a regional IP trading centre and contribute to the high-quality development of the GBA."

Invest Hong Kong seminar promotes in-depth exchanges between fintech enterprises and investment community (with photos),2025-07-10 17:05,2025-07-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/10/P2025071000421.htm,"  The Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) seminar - Meeting Our Leading VCs in Hong Kong - concluded today (July 10), gathering over 200 fintech enterprise founders, venture capital (VC) leaders and industry experts to help inject new vitality into the future prosperity of Hong Kong's fintech ecosystem.
  
  InvestHK has been linking global fintech enterprises with local and international capital resources. Hong Kong's capital environment has shown strong vitality and new opportunities recently. The Government is providing public funding support and introducing measures to accelerate the development of fintech and related areas such as Web3 and AI. Moreover, as of the end of June 2025, the investment amount brought by the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme into Hong Kong is expected to be over HK$46.4 billion, reinforcing Hong Kong's standing as a pre-eminent international investment hub.
  
  For private capital, Hong Kong's advantages are becoming increasingly prominent. Hong Kong has the second-largest capital pool in the Asia-Pacific region, after only the Mainland, with managed private equity funds over US$233.9 billion as of the first half of 2024. As the largest hedge fund centre and cross-border wealth management centre in Asia, Hong Kong continues to attract global capital. Since the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government issued the Policy Statement on Developing Family Office Businesses in Hong Kong, the family office business has developed rapidly. There are more than 2 700 single-family offices operating in Hong Kong, and the scale of managed assets continues to rise. New listing volumes on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong jumped around eight times to US$14 billion in the first half of 2025, fully demonstrating the attractiveness of Hong Kong's financial market.
  
  This seminar created a valuable opportunity for start-ups and growing enterprises to connect with well-known VC leaders. At the seminar, experienced investors shared market patterns and trends in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other markets. For VCs, through the Global Fast Track programme and the invitation-only online business matching platform Fast-Track Connect, they have accelerated access to high-quality deal flows and strengthened strategic investment networks.
  
  Director of MindWorks Capital Mr Jeffrey Wu highlighted Hong Kong's unique advantages for fintech startups, namely a transparent regulatory regime, deep offshore capital markets, and a trusted legal system, which make it an ideal springboard for regional and global expansion. Founding Partner of Wings Capital Ventures Mr Jonathan Wu said that as connectivity between Mainland and Hong Kong continues to accelerate, demand for cross-boundary financial services is growing at a remarkable pace. The Mainland's strengths, including its abundant software development resources and rapid innovation cycles paired with Hong Kong's international market and diverse application scenarios, create a promising synergy.
  
  The Managing Partner of 01Fintech Limited, Mr Kenny Man, emphasised that the Southeast Asian market has huge potential, and fintech enterprises should seize the opportunity to expand their business there. He also noted that the event provided valuable exposure to high-potential fintech innovations, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a global fintech hub with rich cross-border opportunities. These insights provide valuable reference for 01Fintech's investment strategy in the region. Founding General Partner of Transcend Capital Partners Ms Winnie Leung also mentioned that Hong Kong is truly where East meets West, offering a vibrant fusion of cultures and business opportunities. With a substantial amount of capital available, it stands as an ideal hub for exciting venture capital projects.
  
  In addition, the Head of FinTech of Cyberport, Mr Victor Yim, shared the experiences and achievements of Cyberport in supporting fintech and Web3 enterprises. The Senior Manager, New Ventures Development of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC), Ms Josephine Chan, introduced the innovative resources and development platforms provided by HKSTPC for enterprises.
  
  The Global Head of Financial Services, FinTech & Sustainability at InvestHK, Mr King Leung, concluded, ""This seminar has not only built a bridge for exchanges and co-operation among Hong Kong's fintech industry, it has also brought new impetus to shape the global fintech funding landscape. Through seminars like this, enterprises and investors can conduct in-depth exchanges, jointly seize market opportunities, and achieve mutual benefits and win-win results. This promotes the development of the fintech industry and further consolidates Hong Kong's leading position in the global fintech field. We will continue to organise such high-quality activities, both online and offline, to contribute to the development of the industry."""

Government posts fourth batch of land resumption notices for Second Phase development of Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area,2025-07-10 16:45,2025-07-10 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/10/P2025071000318.htm,"The Lands Department (LandsD) today (July 10) posted the fourth batch of land resumption notices in accordance with section 4 of the Lands Resumption Ordinance (Chapter 124) for the Second Phase development of Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen New Development Area (HSK/HT NDA) to resume 37 private lots with a total area of about 27 600 square metres.

The 37 private lots to be resumed this time mainly involve the conclusion of an in-situ land exchange application that requires the acquisition of a small amount of third-party land by the Government for comprehensive development by the land exchange applicant, and the remaining sites without any in-situ land exchange application.

The above 37 private lots will be reverted to the Government upon the expiry of a period of three months from the date of affixing the notices (i.e. October 11, 2025). The Government will release the ex-gratia land compensation to the relevant land owners after land reversion.

The land reversion date is the date of vesting of the ownership of the land in the Government. It is not the departure deadline of the affected households and business undertakings.Three months before the departure deadline of the affected households and business undertakings, the LandsD will post notices in the relevant areas. It is now estimated that the affected households and business undertakings will have to move out in January, 2026 at the earliest. The LandsD is handling the compensation and rehousing matters of the affected persons at full steam, and will endeavour to arrange rehousing for, or release compensation to, eligible persons before the departure deadline.The LandsD and its appointed Community Liaison Service Team will maintain communication with the affected households and business undertakings, and provide them with updated information.

The first three batches of land resumption notices, involving about 196 hectares of land in total for the Second Phase development of HSK/HT NDA, were posted on May 30 and September 19, 2024, and May 8, 2025, respectively. The land under the first two batches of notices had already been reverted to the Government and is gradually being handed over to the Civil Engineering and Development Department for site formation and engineering infrastructure works. The land under the third batch of land resumption notices will be reverted to the Government on August 9, 2025.

Upon full development, the HSK/HT NDA will provide about 66 700 additional housing units capable of accommodating a population of about 184000, and create about 150 000 job opportunities."

二零二五年六月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-07-10 16:30,2025-07-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/10/P2025071000373.htm,"政府統計處今日（七月十日）發表二零二五年六月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年五月在收縮區域的42.1下跌至二零二五年六月的41.6，而未來一個月（即二零二五年七月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.4。按行業分析，不少統計調查涵蓋的行業的業務收益現時動向指數在二零二五年六月較上月下跌，特別是商用服務業（從45.2下跌至43.5）及零售業（從41.3下跌至39.8）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年五月的44.0上升至二零二五年六月的45.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年七月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.6。

評論

政府發言人表示，六月中小企的整體營商氣氛略為減弱。整體就業情況亦稍為回軟。然而，中小企對未來一個月業務情況的預期維持穩定。

展望未來，外圍貿易政策的不確定性將繼續影響營商氣氛。然而，本地經濟表現強韌，內地經濟繼續穩步增長，應可提供支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for June 2025,2025-07-10 16:30,2025-07-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/10/P2025071000381.htm,"The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (July 10) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for June 2025.

The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs decreased from 42.1 in May 2025 in the contractionary zone to 41.6 in June 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. July 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.4. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts for many surveyed sectors dropped in June 2025 as compared with previous month, particularly for the business services (from 45.2 to 43.5) and retail trade (from 41.3 to 39.8).

The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades increased from 44.0 in May 2025 to 45.0 in June 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. July 2025) was 47.6.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that overall business sentiment among SMEs weakened slightly in June. The overall employment situation also softened somewhat. Nonetheless, expectations on the business situation in one month's time remained stable.

Looking ahead, the ongoing uncertainty in trade policies in the external environment would continue to affect business sentiment. Nonetheless, the resilient local economy and sustained steady growth in the Mainland economy should provide support. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

 The Research Grants Council (RGC) announced today (July 10) the funding results of the Areas of Excellence (AoE) Scheme 2025/26 (Thirteenth Round) and the Theme-based Research Scheme (TRS) 2025/26 (Fifteenth Round). This round saw a significant increase in the number of applications for the two Schemes. Altogether, nine outstanding projects with academic and strategic importance for Hong Kong have received a total amount of around $464 million in funding support from the RGC.

  Three research proposals are awarded RGC funding under the AoE Scheme, of which two meritorious projects are provided with a five-year budget totalling around $134 million. Another potentially groundbreaking project is provided with a one-year exploratory funding of $10 million for yielding preliminary results. As for the TRS, six research proposals are funded at a total of $320 million. The lists of the awarded projects are set out in Annexes I and II.

 The Chairman of the RGC, Professor Timothy W. Tong, said, ""I am delighted to announce that the 2025/26 exercise of the two schemes was completed with great success. It is encouraging to see the significant increase in the number of AoE Scheme and TRS applications by 107 per cent and 36 per cent respectively this year, bearing testimony to the robustness of the Hong Kong research community. After rigorous peer reviews based on academic and scientific merits, the RGC is pleased to support two outstanding projects in the areas of plant biotechnology and quantum materials, and an exploratory project on early childhood development under the AoE Scheme. I would like to congratulate the three project teams for successfully securing the funding support to develop their cutting-edge research into areas of excellence.

  ""Under the TRS, the RGC decided to fund six projects which are of strategic importance to Hong Kong's long-term development. These projects cover a wide range of research areas highly relevant to our daily lives, including Alzheimer's disease, adolescents' mental health, eco-friendly disinfectants, chemical weather observations, collaborative generative AI and electronic design automation. I have full confidence that these projects will help bring about lasting societal impacts and make breakthroughs in scientific and technological applications.

  ""The RGC endeavours to enhance the capacity and vibrancy of our research ecosystem through administering various collaborative research funding schemes. Through the annual AoE Scheme and the TRS, the RGC has been supporting universities in leveraging their strengths to pursue excellent and impactful research, thereby solidifying Hong Kong's position as a global leader in higher education and innovation.""

  Professor Tong expressed his gratitude to the panel experts for their valuable contribution to the assessment process, as well as local researchers for their continued support for the AoE Scheme, the TRS and the RGC's work.

  Details of the approved projects for the 2025/26 exercise are available on the RGC website (AoE Scheme: www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/aoe/funded_research/aoe13.html and TRS: www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/funding_opport/trs/funded_research/trs15.html) for reference. A call for proposals for the AoE Scheme and the TRS 2026/27 will be issued later this month."

Steering committee on handling extreme weather releases latest information,2025-07-10 14:42,2025-07-10 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/10/P2025071000665.htm,"  The steering committee on handling extreme weather, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, released the following information today (July 10) in response to the development of weather conditions.

  Due to the impact of torrential rain and squally thunderstorms brought by the remnant of Tropical Cyclone Danas, the weather conditions are expected to remain severe tomorrow (July 11). To ensure the safety of students, and considering that schools across Hong Kong may have already started their summer vacation and the actual impact of class suspension on students' learning and teaching is relatively small, the Education Bureau announces that classes of all day schools, including secondary schools, primary schools, special schools, kindergartens, and kindergartens-cum-child care centres, will be suspended tomorrow.

  The Secondary One registration procedures were originally scheduled for today and tomorrow (July 10 and 11) at the allocated secondary schools. Considering that some parents may have already made arrangements to register at the schools today, the original whole-day registration arrangements for today will remain unchanged. If parents choose to register their child at the allocated secondary school today, they should pay attention to the weather conditions and ensure safety. For safety reasons, parents should not bring their children to the school for registration.

  Additionally, the registration originally scheduled for Friday, July 11 will be rescheduled to next Monday, July 14. If parents are unable to register in person or through an authorised representative on the above dates, please contact the allocated secondary school or the School Places Allocation Section of the Education Bureau (Tel: 2832 7700 or 2832 7740) to make appropriate registration arrangements.

  Units under the Social Welfare Department (SWD) providing child care centre services, services under the Neighbourhood Support Child Care Project, and after school care programmes for pre-primary or primary school children will not open to the public tomorrow (July 11). Members of the public in need may contact the centres or services units concerned for assistance. The SWD will closely monitor the weather conditions and make timely announcements on the latest arrangements of other services when necessary. Members of the public should pay attention to the announcements.

  Under the cross-departmental co-ordination by the steering committee, various government departments have completed all necessary preparatory work and response plans, arranging extra manpower on standby, to safeguard the lives and property of the public as well as public safety. The preparatory work includes:


The Home Affairs Department (HAD) is ready to activate the Emergency Co-ordination Centre as soon as necessary and to open temporary shelters for people in need of temporary accommodation. District Offices have also co-ordinated with other departments and organisations to enhance preparedness and mobilised District Council members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to make necessary preparations.




The Drainage Services Department (DSD) had made special arrangements to inspect and carry out necessary clearance at about 240 locations prone to flooding due to blockages. The ""just-in-time"" arrangement will continue, with 180 emergency response teams to conduct inspection and clearance of drainage channels in different districts across the territory. Members of the public are advised to report any street flooding to the DSD by calling the 24-hour drainage hotline at 2300 1110.




The Highways Department has reminded relevant staff members and contractors to make preparations for the activation of the Emergency Control Centres and handle road emergencies when necessary, including promptly clearing obstructions on roads and blocked road gullies and drains, reinforcing collapsed slopes with emergency shotcrete, etc, with a view to resuming road traffic on major public roads as soon as possible.




The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre (EMSC) of the Security Bureau has made arrangements and will be fully activated when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued or from 5pm today to monitor the situation in the city. Utilising the Common Operational Picture, the EMSC will conduct real-time citywide monitoring and integrate updates from various departments to swiftly assess risks and formulate response plans and measures. Various emergency response teams, including the Fire Services Department, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Civil Aid Service and the Auxiliary Medical Service, have completed all necessary preparatory work and are on standby to handle possible emergencies during heavy rainstorms and high winds, and to provide assistance to those in need.




The Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre of the Transport Department will continue to operate round-the-clock. It will closely monitor traffic and transport conditions with public transport agencies and disseminate emergency traffic information and public transport service arrangements to the public in a timely manner.

ãã
 The steering committee on handling extreme weather is tasked with holistically reviewing and steering cross-departmental overall preparations and response plans for typhoons and rainstorms, and strengthening information dissemination. The committee urges the public to continue to stay alert, stay away from dangerous places such as rivers and slopes in adverse weather conditions, refrain from water sports, and to pay attention to the latest news released by the Government."
立法會︰發展局局長就「動態規劃及整合土地，加快北都大學教育城發展」動議議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-07-10 13:00,2025-07-10 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/10/P2025071000518.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（七月十日）在立法會會議上就「動態規劃及整合土地，加快北都大學教育城發展」動議議案的總結發言全文：

主席：

我再次感謝劉國勳議員提出這項動議辯論、陳月明議員和周文港議員提出的修正案，以及剛才和昨天多位議員提出的意見和建議。

在土地規劃方面，多位議員都提到有三個環節：第一是速度；第二是擴容；第三是配套設施。先說速度，位於洪水橋面積約為五公頃的大學城用地，的確將會最早產出，預計最快可於明年內完成土地平整，可供院校開展它們的建校工程。牛潭尾和新界北新市鎮這兩個新發展區內的大學城用地，我們正加緊完成詳細技術評估，爭取在完成法定規劃程序後，分別在二○二七年和二○二八／二九年展開土地平整。我很清楚聽到有議員覺得這個速度不夠快，但現實上來說，院校作出它們的部署，包括籌組它們的資金、人才和人員，它們也需要時間去作出規劃。正正因為如此，發展局和教育局現時是協力「兩條腿走路」，當發展局進行土地規劃和平整土地的時候，教育局就會着力做好大學城概念發展綱要，希望盡快就這些用地的分配，能夠有一個定案，讓進駐的院校可以在我們造土地的時間，作出它們的規劃。土地造好，它們便可以進場。當然我們都會因應接下來與教育界溝通的工夫，探討我們還需不需要或是否能夠再有提速的空間。

至於擴容方面，我聽到議員的意見，都可以分為兩方面。一是整體我們現時在北都預留這90公頃的用地可否再進一步的擴容；另一面就集中談洪水橋最快能夠完成土地平整的這個區域，本身可否擴容。其實我完全同意土地規劃必須要動態，我們一定要因應社會和經濟的最新發展，適時檢視各類用地的規模、發展參數等規劃事宜。因此，如有需要，大學城的用地可以在現時90公頃的基礎上再作增加。當中洪水橋的法定圖則雖然已經制定，但可予修改。而如果在洪水橋內選中了我們希望擴容的地方，本身現時的規劃用途都可以容納院校進駐，其實甚至可以不需要修改圖則，因為洪水橋內有很多土地現時是規劃了做企業園或一些商業發展用地，本身都是可以容納教育發展。至於牛潭尾和新界北新市鎮根本上稍後才會進入法定規劃程序，所以修改的空間更大。就此，發展局與教育局會保持緊密溝通。但鑑於我剛才提到，其實院校本身也需要時間作它們的部署，所以我們希望做到兩者可以配合。我們絕對不希望土地造好，但未有院校準備好；或者倒轉，院校準備好，但他們心儀或者獲分配的用地又未準備好。其實剛才在這個環節，個別議員都提出了一些意見，可能我們到時就要考慮一些臨時措施。我都希望我們近日和教育局大家用的字眼──「雙劍合璧」，我們願意將一些現有的商業大廈改為宿舍，我們拆牆鬆綁這個舉措都讓各位委員看到政府是願意協力去解決問題，也會考慮一些臨時方案。

至於第三個環節，就是配套方面。多位議員都提到大學城不可能單是做教育，它附近也要有住宅配套、社區設施、亦要有產業用地，也可能要有一些展覽場所，讓它們展示研究成果。其實這些種種正在告訴我們，為何我們在北部都會區發展大學城是這麼有潛力和空間。單是大學城本身的用地，其實我們現時的規劃思維都不會為這些大學城的用地訂立太多的條條框框，正是希望進駐的院校可以善用給予它們的用地作出各種配套，不需要動輒回來再向政府申請。至於在大學城以外、在它們的附近，其實我們現時的規劃思維都有為它們配套不同的設施。舉例牛潭尾40多公頃的大學城用地，其實在它附近、非常近在咫尺的附近，就有可以容納一個類似太古城這樣規模的私人住宅用地的發展配套。在新界北，大學城的用地是優先發展的，正正就是在它最附近，我們都預留了可以提供約5 000至6 000多個私人住宅單位的用地。如果說到產業用地和商業用地的配套，洪水橋的大學城用地根本就是在整個洪水橋很多商業和產業發展用地的中間。在牛潭尾的大學城用地，一個鐵路站之隔，就是新田科技城大量創科用地所在的地點。如果說到新界北新市鎮的大學城，其實它都是屬於一個優先發展區，同樣在這個優先發展區內，我們除了有大學城的用地，也有30多公頃的口岸商住區，也有80多公頃的企業園用地，所以大學城絕對不是自己孤立作為一個大學城的運作，而是在我們很多其他用地的當中。

各位議員，北都擁有新土地、新遷入的人口、新進駐的產業、四通八達的交通網絡，以及與內地的緊密聯繫，的確為專上教育界別提供了寶貴的發展機會。政府必定會善用這個機會，進一步鞏固香港作為國際教育樞紐的地位，將「留學香港」的品牌擦得更亮。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
