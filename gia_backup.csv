CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-03 06:46,2026-01-03 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010200772.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 3) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

 For more health information, the public may call the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111) or visit theCHP's websiteandFacebook Fanpageas well as press releases of the Labour Department on precautions against cold weather for outdoor workers and their employers when the Cold Weather Warning is in force.

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-03 06:46,2026-01-03 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010200770.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月三日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

有關更多健康資訊，可致電衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111），或參閱衞生防護中心網頁和Facebook專頁，以及勞工處於在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，對僱主及僱員發布應採取預防措施的新聞公報。

Public hospitals experience smooth operations on second day of public healthcare fees and charges reform,2026-01-03 00:44,2026-01-03 01:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010300009.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

On the second day (January 2) of the implementation of the Hospital Authority public healthcare fees and charges reform (fees and charges reform), public hospitals maintained smooth operation. The HA will continue to deploy additional manpower across various departments at hospitals to assist patients in need.

On the first day (January 1) of the fees and charges reform, 3 888 patients attended the Accident and Emergency departments (A&E) of 18 public hospitals, a decrease of about 25 per cent when comparing to New Year's Day last year. From midnight to 2pm yesterday (January 2), 2 329 patients attended all A&E, approximately 30 per cent fewer than the same time period of January 2 of last year. Among the patients seeking medical consultation, there were 34 critical cases and 82 emergency cases. According to the new fees and charges arrangement, these two categories of patients will have their A&E charges fully exempted. The other cases subject to the new fees and charges arrangement include 986 urgent cases, 1 171 semi-urgent cases, and 56 non-urgent cases. The average waiting times for semi-urgent and non-urgent cases was around 55 minutes, which is shorter compared to the average waiting time for the same period last year (approximately 147 minutes) for semi-urgent and non-urgent cases.

Additionally, the HA's 75 Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs) providing family medicine outpatient services also operated smoothly yesterday. As of 2pm yesterday, approximately 10 000 patients attended these FMCs, with overall service usage remaining similar to that before the implementation of the measures.

The HA has deployed additional manpower to expedite the processing of patients' medical fee waivers applications. As of 2pm yesterday, public hospitals received approximately 3 300 applications in total for the day, with nearly 90per cent approved, amounting to about 2 900 applications. The remaining cases will be processed as soon as possible. Compared to the 14 000 individuals who were approved for medical fee waivers in 2023/24, the HA has approved approximately 35 000 applications since early November last year, benefiting citizens in need.

Furthermore, patients who had previously scheduled non-urgent radiology services or pathology services will be receiving payment notifications through mail or the HA mobile application HA Go starting from January 1. The HA reminds patients with recent appointments can arrange payment as early as practicable upon receiving the notification. For patients with distant appointment dates, payment can be arranged at their convenience after receiving the notification. Patients are not required to settle the payment immediately. Patients undergoing non-urgent radiology services must settle the payment at least 14 days before their appointment date, while patients requiring pathology services must settle the payment before testing. If patients have questions regarding payment items, they can inquire with healthcare staff during follow-up appointment, and specialist out-patient clinics will also have Integrated Patient Service Centres to provide detailed explanations about payment arrangements.

The HA reminds patients that the fees and charges reform has been implemented. Patients are advised to familiarise themselves with the new fees and charges arrangements before visiting public hospitals or outpatient clinics. Some medical service procedures have also been modified. Every cluster has set up hotlines (see table below) for patients to inquire about the fees and charges reform arrangements. Patients can also visit the HA website to learn about the new arrangements.

公營醫療收費改革實施第二日　公立醫院運作暢順,2026-01-02 23:57,2026-01-03 00:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200857.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）實施公營醫療收費改革（收費改革）的各項措施第二日（一月二日），各公立醫院服務運作暢順。醫管局會繼續加強人手在醫院不同部門協助有需要的病人。

在推行收費改革首日（一月一日），醫管局轄下18間公立醫院的急症室共接收了3 888名病人，較去年元旦日減少約25%。至於今日零時至下午二時，所有急症室共接收了2 329名病人，較去年一月二日同一時段減少約30%。求診病人當中，34宗屬危殆個案、82宗屬危急個案。在新收費安排下，這兩類病人會獲得全數豁免急症室收費。適用於新收費的其他個案分別為緊急個案986宗、次緊急個案1 171宗，以及非緊急個案56宗。其間，次緊急及非緊急病人的平均輪候時間約為55分鐘，相比去年同期次緊急及非緊急的平均輪候時間（約為147分鐘）為短。

另外，醫管局75間提供家庭醫學門診服務的家庭醫學診所運作大致暢順。今日截至下午二時，家庭醫學診所有約10 000名病人就診，整體服務使用情況與措施實行前大致相若。

為加快審批病人的醫療費用減免申請，醫管局已加派人手處理。各公立醫院今日單日截至下午二時，共收到約3 300宗申請，批出接近九成約2 900宗申請，餘下的申請個案會盡快處理。相較23／24年度的14 000人獲批醫療費用減免，自去年十一月初以來，醫管局已批出約三萬五千宗申請，惠及有需要市民。

另外，部分早前已預約接受非緊急放射科檢查或病理檢驗服務的病人，會由一月一日起陸續透過郵遞或流動應用程式HA Go收到繳費通知。醫管局提醒病人，如果在短期內已預約服務的病人，可以在收到繳費通知後，盡快安排繳費。如果預約期較長的病人，在收到繳費通知後，可以自行安排合適的繳費時間，毋須即時繳費，接受非緊急放射科檢查的病人需要在預約日期前最少14日繳費；而接受病理檢驗服務的病人，則可以在接受檢驗前繳費。病人如對繳費項目有疑問，可以在覆診時向醫護人員查詢，專科門診亦設有綜合病人服務站，可以向病人詳細講解繳費的詳情。

醫管局提醒病人，收費改革已正式推行，病人前往公立醫院或門診就診前，應先參考新的收費安排，部分醫療服務的流程亦有轉變。各醫院聯網亦會設立查詢熱線（詳見下表），供病人查詢收費改革的各項安排。病人亦可瀏覽醫管局網頁，了解收費改革的各項細節。

一名三十二歲的男旅客今日從馬來西亞吉隆坡飛抵本港。海關人員清關時，在其寄艙的六個木製酒盒的夾層中發現該批懷疑可卡因，遂把該名男子拘捕。

案件仍在調查中。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，這確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

Hong Kong Customs detects drug trafficking case involving incoming passenger at airport (with photo),2026-01-02 22:00,2026-01-02 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200751.htm,"​Hong Kong Customs detected a drug trafficking case involving an incoming air passenger at Hong Kong International Airport today (January 2) and seized about 4 kilograms of suspected cocaine with an estimated market value of about $3.1 million.

The case involved a 32-year-old male passenger arriving in Hong Kong from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cocaine concealed in the false compartments of his six check-in wooden wine boxes. The man was subsequently arrested.

An investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

於反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括裝修單位、展覽場地及零售店等，共拘捕十名懷疑非法勞工。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為六男四女，年齡介乎二十三至六十四歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

10 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2026-01-02 19:20,2026-01-02 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200622.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"", joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"" and ""Windsand"", and a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"" from December 24, 2025, to yesterday (January 1). A total of 10 suspected illegal workers were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including renovation flats, exhibition venues and retail stores etc. Ten suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised six men and four women, aged 23 to 64. An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."

最新監測數據
———————
本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-02 17:40,2026-01-02 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200543.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 2), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Any person who is currently a stall tenant is not allowed to bid in the first round of auction for any stall in the same market, and will only be allowed to bid for one stall in the second round of auction or to select one stall in the same market on a first-come, first-served basis (except Stanley Waterfront Mart). The existing tenants under the new three-year fixed-term tenancy scheme are allowed to bid for a stall in the auction or select a stall on a first-come, first-served basis in the same market, but shall vacate the current stall and return it to the FEHD before the effective date of commencement of the new tenancy agreement.""

Details of the open auctions and the public market stalls concerned (including stalls for open auction at reduced upset prices) have been uploaded to the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pleasant_environment/tidy_market/open_auction_coming.html).

Provisional statistics of retail sales for November 2025,2026-01-02 16:30,2026-01-02 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200441.htm,"
  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released the latest figures on retail sales today (January 2).

  The value of total retail sales in November 2025, provisionally estimated at $33.7 billion, increased by 6.5% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of the value of total retail sales in October 2025 increased by 6.9% compared with a year earlier. For the first 11 months of 2025 taken together, it was provisionally estimated that the value of total retail sales increased by 0.4% compared with the same period in 2024.

  Of the total retail sales value in November 2025, online sales accounted for 11.2%. The value of online retail sales in that month, provisionally estimated at $3.8 billion, increased by 28.4% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of online retail sales in October 2025 increased by 27.2% compared with a year earlier. For the first 11 months of 2025 taken together, it was provisionally estimated that the value of online retail sales increased by 11.4% compared with the same period in 2024.

  After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales in November 2025 increased by 4.4% compared with a year earlier. The revised estimate of the volume of total retail sales in October 2025 increased by 5.3% compared with a year earlier. For the first 11 months of 2025 taken together, the provisional estimate of the total retail sales decreased by 0.9% in volume compared with the same period in 2024.

  Analysed by broad type of retail outlet in descending order of the provisional estimate of the value of sales and comparing November 2025 with November 2024, the value of sales of electrical goods and other consumer durable goods not elsewhere classified increased by 38.6%. This was followed by sales of jewellery, watches and clocks, and valuable gifts (+3.6% in value); other consumer goods not elsewhere classified (+5.5%); wearing apparel (+3.0%); commodities in department stores (+3.8%); food, alcoholic drinks and tobacco (+2.0%); medicines and cosmetics (+9.2%); and optical shops (+7.3%).

  On the other hand, the value of sales of commodities in supermarkets decreased by 2.1% in November 2025 over a year earlier. This was followed by sales of motor vehicles and parts (-3.1% in value); fuels (-11.1%); footwear, allied products and other clothing accessories (-4.3%); furniture and fixtures (-6.1%); books, newspapers, stationery and gifts (-10.6%); and Chinese drugs and herbs (-1.8%).

  Based on the seasonally adjusted series, the provisional estimate of the value of total retail sales increased by 3.9% in the three months ending November 2025 compared with the preceding three-month period, while the provisional estimate of the volume of total retail sales increased by 2.2%.

Commentary

  A government spokesman said that retail sales sustained its recovery momentum in November. The value of total retail sales increased notably further by 6.5% over a year earlier. Sales of many broad retail outlet types increased.

  Looking ahead, the gradual improvement in local consumption sentiment amid sustained economic growth, coupled with the vibrant growth in inbound visitors, will continue to benefit retail businesses.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the revised figures on value index and value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for October 2025 as well as the provisional figures for November 2025. The provisional figures on the value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet as well as the corresponding year-on-year changes for the first 11 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 2 presents the revised figures on value of online retail sales for October 2025 as well as the provisional figures for November 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first 11 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 3 presents the revised figures on volume index of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for October 2025 as well as the provisional figures for November 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first 11 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 4 shows the movements of the value and volume of total retail sales in terms of the year-on-year rate of change for a month compared with the same month in the preceding year based on the original series, and in terms of the rate of change for a three-month period compared with the preceding three-month period based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The classification of retail companies follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  These retail sales statistics measure the sales receipts in respect of goods sold by local retail companies and are primarily intended for gauging the short-term business performance of the local retail sector. Data on retail sales are collected from local retail companies through the Monthly Survey of Retail Sales (MRS). Local retail companies with and without physical shops are covered in MRS and their sales, both through conventional shops and online channels, are included in the retail sales statistics.

  The retail sales statistics cover consumer spending on goods but not on services (such as those on housing, catering, medical care and health services, transport and communication, financial services, education and entertainment) which account for over 50% of the overall consumer spending. Moreover, they include spending on goods in Hong Kong by visitors but exclude spending outside Hong Kong by Hong Kong residents. Hence they should not be regarded as indicators for measuring overall consumer spending.

  Users interested in the trend of overall consumer spending should refer to the data series of private consumption expenditure (PCE), which is a major component of the Gross Domestic Product published at quarterly intervals. Compiled from a wide range of data sources, PCE covers consumer spending on both goods (including goods purchased from all channels) and services by Hong Kong residents whether locally or abroad. Please refer to the C&SD publication ""Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Component"" for more details.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey of Retail Sales"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080003&scode=530).

  Users who have enquiries about the survey results may contact the Distribution Services Statistics Section of the C&SD (Tel: 3903 7400; email:mrs@censtatd.gov.hk)."
機電工程署公布中華電力有限公司電力供應系統的檢視結果報告,2026-01-02 16:30,2026-01-02 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200234.htm,"機電工程署（機電署）今日（一月二日）公布中華電力有限公司（中電）電力供應系統的檢視結果報告，並上載至以下網頁：www.emsd.gov.hk/filemanager/ReviewResultsReport(Chi).pdf。

在由本地專家學者組成的檢視中電供電系統督導小組監督下，機電署已完成檢視工作並向環境及生態局（環境局）提交報告。檢視工作全面分析了中電由二○二一年至二○二四年六月期間發生的所有電力供應中斷和電壓驟降事故的成因，並且針對中電供電系統的現況提出五個行動目標，並按此制定11個行動策略及提出共43項改善建議。

環境局會和機電署密切監察中電執行檢視報告所作的建議，特別是促進中電建立更積極的維修保養文化，務求進一步提高中電供電系統的穩定性和可靠度，減低未來發生電力事故的機會和影響。

環境局發言人說：「政府十分重視電力公司維持其供電系統安全可靠的能力。鑑於二○二四上半年中電發生多宗電力事故，環境局要求機電署全面檢視中電電力供應系統並作出針對性的建議，減少電力供應中斷、電壓驟降事故及事故對市民的影響。環境局衷心感謝由盧國華工程師帶領的督導小組的不懈努力，以及對檢視工作提出的專業意見。」

在機電署督促下，中電在檢視工作進行期間已開展部分改善措施，包括利用智能管理系統Grid-V偵測供電設備附近環境的危害、加裝避雷裝置，以及在較關鍵的變電站加裝防水閘或防洪設備。中電在二○二五年出現影響超過2 000戶的大型停電事故的宗數按年減半，並且在早前超強颱風樺加沙和颱風韋帕襲港並懸掛十號颶風信號時，仍大致維持正常的電力供應。

在二○二五年十二月十八日下午於九龍城區發生的停電事故，中電啓動了電網互聯線路調配備用電力，並進行遙距操作，於四分鐘內為超過七成受影響客戶恢復供電，實證報告建議「增加市區配電網互聯線路」能有效減少事故對用戶的影響範圍和時間。中電亦按照新訂立的服務承諾，在22分鐘內安排維修團隊到達現場作停電檢查。

為督促中電全面有序落實報告的建議，進一步改善供電系統的穩定性和可靠度，中電按政府要求訂立了相應的行動計劃時間表。報告的五個行動目標及其建議內容主要包括：

（一）減少發生電力供應中斷和電壓驟降事故

加快推動設備維修保養數碼化；
對高風險的地下線路進行測試；
與掘路工程承辦商積極協作及跟進；及
改善發電廠的避雷系統。


（二）減低電力供應中斷和電壓驟降對客戶的影響

增加市區配電網互聯線路，以強化配電網絡互作備用的能力；
與主要公共服務提供者共同制定聯合危機應對演練計劃；及
加強與物業管理公司進行事故應對演習。


（三）在電力事故後加快恢復供電

改善事故處理及恢復供電工作流程；及
增加使用臨時電源供電的靈活性和改善應用流動發電機的標準作業程序。


（四）善用創新科技進行維修保養和監測設備的健康狀況

擴展智能管理系統Grid-V的應用；
透過人工智能鏡頭監察建築地盤，減低輸配電纜遭第三方損壞的機會；及
透過智能電錶基礎建設的數據分析減少低壓電力事故。


（五）全方位推動更積極的維修保養文化

研究對採購物料制訂獨立抽樣測試的機制，加強質量管理；及
與承辦商建立全面的溝通渠道，加強合約管理。

Electrical and Mechanical Services Department releases review results report on CLP Power Hong Kong Limited's power supply system,2026-01-02 16:30,2026-01-02 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200244.htm,"The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) today (January 2) released the review results report on CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP)'s power supply system. The report has been uploaded to the following website: www.emsd.gov.hk/filemanager/ReviewResultsReport(Eng).pdf.

Under the supervision of the Steering Committee on Review of CLP's Power Supply System, comprising local experts and scholars, the EMSD has completed the review and submitted the report to the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB). The review comprehensively analysed the causes of all incidents of power supply interruptions and voltage dips of CLP from 2021 to June 2024. Targeting the existing condition of CLP's power supply system, the review results report proposed five action objectives, formulated 11 action strategies, and put forward43 recommendations based on the said action objectives.

The EEB will work with the EMSD to closely monitor CLP's implementation of the recommendations in the review results report, particularly on fostering CLP to establish a more proactive maintenance culture, with a view to further enhancing the stability and reliability of CLP's power supply system and reducing the likelihood and impacts of power incidents in the future.

The spokesperson for the EEB said, ""The Government attaches great importance to the power companies' abilities to maintain a safe and reliable power system. In light of the multiple power incidents that occurred with CLP in the first half of 2024, the EEB requested the EMSD to conduct a comprehensive review of CLP's power supply system and make targeted recommendations. These recommendations should be focused on reducing power supply interruptions and voltage dips, as well as minimising the impact of such incidents on the public. The EEB deeply appreciates the relentless efforts of the Steering Committee led by Mr Kelvin Lo and their professional advice tendered for the review.""

Under the supervision of the EMSD, CLP had started to implement some of the improvement measures before completion of the review. Measures include using the Intelligent Management System Grid-V to detect risks in the vicinity of power supply equipment, installing additional lightning protection systems, and adding floodgates or flood protection facilities at more critical substations. The number of CLP's large-scale power interruption incidents affecting over 2 000 households in 2025 were reduced by half year-on-year, and CLP's power supply system remained generally intact during the passage of Super Typhoon Ragasa and Typhoon Wipha when Hurricane Signals No. 10 were issued.

As regards the power interruption incident that occurred in Kowloon City during the afternoon of December 18, 2025, CLP activated interconnectors to allocate backup power and conducted remote operations, restoring supply to over 70 per cent of affected customers within four minutes, which proved that the recommendation ""to increase the number of interconnectors in the urban distribution network"" in the review report may effectively reduce the scope and duration of incident impacts on customers. CLP, in accordance with the newly established service pledge, dispatched a maintenance team to the site within 22 minutes after the incident to conduct a power outage inspection.

To ensure that CLP fully and systematically implements the recommendations of the report, thereby further enhancing the stability and reliability of its power supply system, CLP has established an action plan timetable per the Government's request. The five action objectives and their recommendations in the review results report mainly include:

(1)Reduce incidents of power supply interruptions and voltage dips

expedite the digitisation of equipment maintenance;
conduct tests on high-risk underground circuits;
proactively collaborate and follow up with road excavation contractors; and
improve the lightning protection systems of power stations.


(2)Alleviate the impact of power supply interruptions and voltage dips on customers

increase the number of interconnectors in the urban distribution network to strengthen mutual backup ability;
formulate a joint crisis response drill plan with major public service providers; and
strengthen incident response drills with property management companies.


(3)Expedite power restoration after power supply interruption incidents

optimise the incident handling and power restoration workflows; and
increase flexibility in deploying temporary power supply sources and improve standard operating procedures for mobile generator deployment.


(4)Leverage innovative technologies for maintenance and monitoring of equipment conditions

extend the application of the Intelligent Management System Grid-V;
uplift construction site activity monitoring by deploying AI-powered cameras to reduce the risk of third-party damage to transmission and distribution cables; and
leverage smart meter and data analytics of advanced metering infrastructure to reduce low voltage power incidents.


(5)Promote a more proactive maintenance culture comprehensively

explore the feasibility of establishing an independent material sampling and testing mechanism for quality assurance; and
establish comprehensive communication channels with contractors to enhance contract management.

Grading of beach water quality released,2026-01-02 16:00,2026-01-02 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200400.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (January 2) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast)."

響應子宮頸癌關注月　積極預防子宮頸癌,2026-01-02 12:32,2026-01-02 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200254.htm,"​衞生署今日（一月二日）呼籲市民透過實踐健康生活模式及採取有效預防子宮頸癌的方法，包括接種人類乳頭瘤病毒（簡稱HPV）疫苗及定期接受子宮頸篩查，響應子宮頸癌關注月。

衞生署衞生防護中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「政府非常重視癌症防控工作，一直透過疫苗、普查和篩查等方式，實現『早預防、早發現、早治療』的目標。自二○○四年起推行子宮頸普查計劃，並自二○一九年起將HPV疫苗接種納入香港兒童免疫接種計劃，過去幾年一直維持約九成的極高接種率，大大減低香港女性患上子宮頸癌的機會。衞生署更於二○二四年十二月開展一次性HPV疫苗補種計劃，至今已接種超過48 000劑疫苗。政府亦將進一步擴大子宮頸篩查服務，鼓勵更多婦女接受篩查，保障健康。」

世界衞生組織（世衞）轄下的國際癌症研究機構將每年的一月定為子宮頸癌關注月，目標是透過提升大眾對子宮頸癌的意識及提倡預防措施，以期在下世紀把子宮頸癌這一公共衞生問題消除。

在香港，子宮頸癌是二○二三年第七常見的女性癌症，於女性致命癌症中排第九位。大部分子宮頸癌由持續感染高風險的HPV引致。政府建議婦女在未有性行為前接種HPV疫苗、定期進行子宮頸篩查、進行安全性行為（例如使用安全套及避免有多個性伴侶）以預防感染HPV。此外，吸煙會增加患上子宮頸癌的風險，因此應避免吸煙。

HPV疫苗
————

徐樂堅醫生說：「接種HPV疫苗是預防子宮頸癌最有效的措施之一，尤其在婦女未感染病毒前（即未有性行為前），疫苗能發揮最佳效能。自二○一九／二○學年起，衞生署在香港兒童免疫接種計劃下，為合資格的小五女童免費接種HPV疫苗。衞生署的學童免疫注射小組會到學校為就讀小學五年級的女童接種第一劑疫苗，並於翌學年女童升讀六年級時接種第二劑。二○二四／二五學年小六女童的第二劑HPV疫苗覆蓋率已達92%。」

衞生署於二○二四年十二月開展一次性HPV疫苗補種計劃，為二○○四年至二○○八年出生、尚未完成接種HPV疫苗的女性香港居民提供免費補種。合資格人士只需先登記「醫健通」，便可透過網頁或致電2855 1333預約於醫務衞生局基層醫療署轄下的樂妍站或指定地區康健中心／站免費接種HPV疫苗。計劃為期約兩年，詳情可瀏覽衞生署網頁。

子宮頸篩查
—————

HPV感染或早期子宮頸癌可能沒有任何明顯症狀。因此，25至64歲曾有性經驗的婦女應定期進行子宮頸篩查。市民可透過衞生署網頁了解子宮頸篩查相關資訊。衞生署亦定期透過子宮頸普查資訊系統和醫健通流動應用程式向適齡婦女發出通知，提醒她們定期接受篩查。

衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、樂妍站、非政府機構及私營醫護服務提供者都有提供子宮頸篩查服務。常見的子宮頸篩查方法包括以醫護人員採集的子宮頸樣本進行HPV檢測及／或子宮頸細胞檢驗（又稱子宮頸抹片或柏氏抹片）。世衞亦建議透過自行採集陰道樣本進行HPV檢測是子宮頸篩查的另一可靠方法。自二○二四年起，11間母嬰健康院進行HPV自行採樣檢測先導計劃及研究，探討陰道HPV自我採樣的可行性和接受程度。此外，樂妍站計劃在二○二六年第一季推出HPV自行採樣檢測計劃，詳情將稍後於樂妍站網頁公布。

值得留意的是，本港乃至國際間目前尚未有充分科學證據支持使用自行採集經血或尿液樣本作子宮頸篩查。衞生署會持續檢視最新科學實證。

婦女如計劃在母嬰健康院進行子宮頸篩查，可透過24小時熱線3166 6631預約，或聯絡樂妍站（網頁）或十八區地區康健中心／站（網頁）預約包括子宮頸癌篩查在內的個人化女性基層醫療服務。更多有關子宮頸癌和篩查的資訊，請瀏覽衞生署網頁。

健康人生計劃
——————

與此同時，基層醫療署積極推廣健康人生計劃，以預防為本、全人照護為核心，並參考最新實證，為市民制訂不同人生階段的個人化健康策略。家庭醫生及基層醫療專業人員將攜手合作，根據年齡、性別、家族史等個人因素，提供慢性病及癌症篩查、健康生活方式指導等服務。樂妍站提供個人化女性基層醫療服務，包括健康評估、個別諮詢、子宮頸癌及乳癌篩查等，並在有需要時轉介至家庭醫生跟進。"
Take action to prevent cervical cancer in support of Cervical Cancer Awareness Month,2026-01-02 12:32,2026-01-02 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200257.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) today (January 2) urged members of the public to support Cervical Cancer Awareness Month by adopting healthy lifestyles and taking effective precautionary measures against cervical cancer, including receiving the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and undergoing regular cervical screening.

  ""The Government attaches great importance to cancer prevention and control. We have consistently pursued the goal of 'early prevention, early detection and early treatment' through vaccination. The Cervical Screening Programme has been launched since 2004. HPV vaccination has been included under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme (HKCIP) since 2019, and a high vaccination rate of about 90 per cent has been maintained in recent years. This significantly lowers the risk of cervical cancer in Hong Kong females. The DH also launched a one-off HPV Vaccination Catch-up Programme in December 2024, with over 48 000 doses administered so far. The Government will further expand cervical screening services to encourage more women to undergo screening and safeguard their health,"" said Dr Edwin Tsui, the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (WHO) designated January as Cervical Cancer Awareness Month to raise awareness and motivate actions against cervical cancer, with the goal of eliminating this public health concern within the next century.

In Hong Kong, cervical cancer was the seventh most common female cancer in 2023 and the ninth leading cause of cancer deaths among females. As most cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV, women are recommended to receive HPV vaccination before having sexual relations, undergo regular cervical screenings and practise safe sex (such as using condoms and avoiding multiple sexual partners) to prevent HPV infection. In addition, smoking should be avoided as it can increase the risk of cervical cancer.

HPV vaccination
--------------------

  ""HPV vaccination is among the most effective measures for cervical cancer prevention, especially for those who have never been exposed to HPV infection, i.e. before their first sexual encounter. Since the 2019/20 school year, the DH has been providing free HPV vaccinations to eligible Primary 5 schoolgirls under the HKCIP. The DH's School Immunisation Teams provide the first dose of vaccine to Primary 5 female students at their schools, and the second dose will be given to them when they reach Primary 6 during the following school year. The second dose coverage rates of HPV vaccination for Primary 6 girls in the school year 2024/25 has reached 92 per cent,"" Dr Tsui said.

In December 2024, the DH launched a one-off HPV Vaccination Catch-up Programme, offering free catch-up vaccinations to female Hong Kong residents born between 2004 and 2008 who have not completed their HPV vaccination. Eligible persons only need to register with eHealth, and can schedule an appointment through the website or by calling 2855 1333 to receive a free HPV vaccination at Women Wellness Satellites (WWSs) or designated District Health Centres (DHCs)/DHC Expresses (DHCEs) under the Primary Healthcare Commission of the Health Bureau. The programme is to last for about two years. Details can be found on the DH's website.

Cervical screening
----------------------

Infection with HPV or early stages of cervical cancer may not have any noticeable symptoms. Therefore, women aged 25 to 64 who have had sexual experience should undergo regular cervical screenings. Members of the public can access information about cervical screenings via the DH website. The DH also regularly sends reminders to eligible women via the Cervical Screening Information System and the eHealth mobile app to schedule their screenings.

Cervical screening services are available at Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) of the DH, WWSs, as well as through non-governmental organisations and private healthcare providers. Common screening methods include HPV testing and/or a cytology examination (also called a cervical smear or pap smear) performed by healthcare professionals. The WHO has also recommended vaginal self-sampling for HPV testing as another reliable method for cervical screening. Starting in 2024, the DH initiated HPV testing of self-collected samples at 11 MCHCs to study the feasibility and acceptability of vaginal HPV self-sampling locally. Moreover, HPV testing of self-collected samples is planned to be rolled out in WWSs in the first quarter of 2026. Details will be announced later on the WWS's website.

It is important to note that there is currently insufficient scientific evidence in Hong Kong or internationally to support the use of self-collected menstrual blood or urine samples for cervical screenings. The DH will continue to review the latest scientific evidence.

Women who wish to receive a cervical screening at MCHCs can schedule an appointment through the 24-hour hotline at 3166 6631, or contact WWSs via itswebsiteor 18 DHCs/DHCEs (website) for personalised primary healthcare services for women including cervical cancer screening. For further information on cervical cancer and screenings, please visit the DH's website.

Life course preventive care plan
--------------------------------------

At the same time, the Primary Healthcare Commission is actively promoting the life course preventive care plan. Based on the core principles of prevention-oriented and whole-person care, a personalised preventive care plan will be formulated to address the health needs of citizens across different life stages with reference to the latest evidence. Family doctors and primary healthcare professionals will collaborate to provide health advice and education on chronic diseases and cancer screening as well as healthy lifestyles according to age, sex and personal factors such as family history. The WWSs offer personalised primary healthcare services for women, including health assessments, individual consultations, cervical cancer and breast cancer screenings, etc and will refer cases to family doctors for follow-ups when necessary."
Reclamation works at Lung Kwu Tan proposed,2026-01-02 12:30,2026-01-02 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010200299.htm,"The Government proposes to carry out reclamation works within an area of about 240 hectares of foreshore and seabed at Lung Kwu Tan. The extent of the area of foreshore and seabed affected is described in a noticegazetted today (January 2).

The proposed works include filling of the seabed to form about 145 hectares of land, reprovisioning of a submarine outfall, and construction of a seawall. The proposed works are tentatively scheduled to commence in 2028.

The notice and its related plan are posted near the site. The plan is also available for inspection at:

New round of tenders invited for Standing Offer Agreement for supply of IT professional services to government departments,2026-01-02 09:30,2026-01-02 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010100396.htm,"  The Digital Policy Office (DPO) today (January 2) gazetted a notice to invite tenders for the provision of professional services to undertake information technology (IT) projects in the Government under thenew round of the Standing Offer Agreement for Quality Professional Services (SOA-QPS) scheme for a period of 48 months. Interested tenderers must submit their tenders by noon on January 30, 2026 (Friday).

  ""The new round of the SOA-QPS scheme introduces several new measures to promote the development of the local IT industry. These include increasing the maximum number of standing offer agreements that can be awarded to allow more service providers to participate in the scheme; lowering the essential requirements for tendering to encourage more local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups to participate; raising the financial limit of contract value of work assignments to allow larger government contracts to be awarded through the scheme; and introducing a brand-new Category D to promote and expand the wider adoption of diversified secure and reliable technologies in government IT systems. These measures will unleash greater market potential, thereby creating business opportunities for more suppliers to participate in government IT projects,"" a spokesperson for the DPO said.

  Since its initial launch in 2005, the SOA-QPS scheme has always been an important part of the Government's strategy to promote the development of the local IT industry, drive the innovative application of IT, and improve the efficiency and quality of public services. As part of the Government’s IT outsourcing strategy, the scheme has been an effective means of addressing the Government's large demand for IT professional services. It also provides promising business prospects for the local IT industry and helps to bring innovative and creative IT services to government departments. The total value of the contracts awarded in the past four years under the prevailing scheme is over $3.9 billion. It is anticipated that the total contract value of the coming scheme will be even higher.

  The new SOA-QPS scheme covers four categories of IT services:

Category A: pre-implementation services, system development, implementation and post-implementation dedicated management services of IT services;
Category B: information security, data privacy, independent testing, independent quality control and quality assurance as well as dedicated management services;
Category C: deployment and maintenance of IT application systems common to government bureaux and departments; and
Category D: services same as Category A but specifically for IT systems adopting diversified, secure and reliable technologies

  Category A is further divided into Major and Minor Groups. The demarcation is based on the contract value of work assignment, which has been increased from $3 million to $4 million. The main objective of the setting up of Minor Group is to allow more local SMEs to participate in the government projects while the increase on demarcation limit enables SMEs to participate in more government projects.

  The new round of the SOA-QPS scheme also strengthens the regulation and monitoring procedures of contractors' performance by taking into account contractors' performance in contracts awarded under the previous round of the scheme. During the 48-month contract period, government bureaux and departments (B/Ds) may invite contractors in the relevant categories and groups to submit proposals for individual IT projects. Contractors will be selected based on both technical and price assessments. B/Ds will award a service contract to the contractor whose proposal meets the technical requirements and attains the highest combined score according to the marking scheme. Contractors with continuous subpar performance may be suspended by the DPO from further bidding under the scheme until their performance improves.

  The tender notice and the tender documents are available for download at the DPO's website (www.digitalpolicy.gov.hk/en/our_work/digital_infrastructure/business_window/tender_eoi_rfp/).

  A briefing session will be held on January 16, 2026 for prospective tenderers. Details are set out in the tender documents."
政府資訊科技專業服務新一輪常備承辦協議招標,2026-01-02 09:30,2026-01-02 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/02/P2026010100391.htm,"​​數字政策辦公室（數字辦）今日（一月二日）在政府憲報刊登招標公告，邀請承辦商承投新一輪為期四十八個月的優質資訊科技專業服務常備承辦協議（協議），為政府資訊科技項目提供專業服務。有興趣的投標者須於二○二六年一月三十日（星期五）中午十二時前提交投標書。

數字辦發言人表示：「新一輪協議有多項新措施推動本地資訊科技業界的發展，包括增加可授予的常備合約總數量，讓更多服務供應商能參與協議；降低投標的基本要求，以鼓勵更多本地中小企業和初創企業參與；提高合約價值的金額上限，以容許在協議下批出更大型的政府合約；新增一項服務類別（丁類），以促進和推廣政府部門更廣泛地在資訊科技系統中使用安全可靠多元技術。這些措施將釋放更大市場潛力，為更多供應商參與政府資訊科技項目創造商機。」

自二○○五年首次推出以來，協議一直是政府促進本地資訊科技產業發展、推動資訊科技創新應用、以及提升公共服務效率和質素的重要策略組成部分。作為政府資訊科技項目外判策略其中一環，協議一直有效協助政府應對資訊科技專業服務的龐大需求，亦為本地資訊科技業界帶來莫大商機，並為各政府部門提供創新和具創意的資訊科技服務。現行協議在過去四年批出的合約總值超過三十九億元，預計新一輪協議的合約總值將會更高。

新協議涵蓋四類資訊科技服務：

甲類：資訊科技服務前期推行服務、系統發展、推行及實施後相關專案管理服務；
乙類：資訊保安、資料隱私、獨立測試、獨立品質控制和品質保證及相關的專案管理專業服務；
丙類：推出政府部門共用的資訊科技應用系統及其維修服務；以及
丁類：與甲類相同的服務，但專門針對採用安全可靠多元技術的資訊科技系統。

服務類別「甲」再分為大型和小型項目組別，用以劃分有關組別的項目合約價值亦由三百萬元提高至四百萬元。設立小型項目組別的主要目的是讓更多本地中小企能參與政府項目。提高項目劃界合約價值則有助於中小企參與更多政府項目。

新一輪協議亦加強規管和監察承辦商表現的程序，把承辦商在對上一輪協議所批出合約的表現納入評核範疇。在為期四十八個月的合約期內，各政府決策局和部門（局／部門）可邀請相關類別和組別的承辦商提交個別項目資訊科技建議書，承辦商的遴選將綜合考慮技術水平和報價。局／部門會根據評分制度，向符合技術要求並取得最高總分的承辦商批出服務合約。如有連續表現欠佳的承辦商，數字辦可暫停其參與協議下的投標，直至該承辦商表現有所改善。
