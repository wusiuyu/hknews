InnoCarnival 2025 showcases innovations to ignite I&T dreams,2025-10-18 18:20,2025-10-18 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800605.htm,"  Organised by the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC), InnoCarnival 2025 (IC 2025) is being held from today (October 18) to October 26 at the Hong Kong Science Park in Sha Tin. Under the theme ""I&T Unlocks Your Dream"", this year's Carnival features a number of exhibits of local innovation and technology (I&T) achievements.

  The Acting Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong, officiated at the opening ceremony of IC 2025. He said that the Government will continue to leverage Hong Kong's strengths to promote I&T development through policy guidance, financial support and talent cultivation, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an international I&T centre. He expressed hope that the public will be encouraged to explore and experience the many benefits that I&T brings to society through the InnoCarnival, and offer greater support for Hong Kong’s I&T development.

The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation are campaign partners of IC 2025. The event is receiving support from about 50 programme partners, including local universities, R&D centres and platforms, government departments and other organisations, which have set up booths at the Hong Kong Science Park, showcasing a series of I&T achievements and interactive games. Also, a diverse lineup of about 150 workshops and more than 10 webinars across various popular subjects including artificial intelligence and ecological environment will be available during the Carnival, with the aim of showing the public the close interface between I&T and people's daily lives.

In addition, the second City I&T Grand Challenge: The Showcase will also be staged during IC 2025. Prototypes of the winning solutions will be showcased to the public for trial through real-life scenarios. The second City I&T Grand Challenge was launched under the theme ""Hong Kong's Got I&T"" to promote an I&T culture and enhance the application of I&T in the community. It invited submissions from different sectors of the community to develop I&T solutions focusing on two subjects, namely ""I&T for Nature (Yama)"" (improving the operation and management of country parks and campsites, and enhancing hikers' experiences in nature) and ""I&T for Community (Community Wellness)"" (enhancing support for carers). Twenty winners from the University/Tertiary Institute and Open Groups received support from the ITC. Upon training and refinement of I&T solutions for over half a year, teams have transformed their ideas from the competition into prototypes for trials at over 50 designated venues, including government departments and social communities, involving nearly 5 000 end users.

All IC 2025 activities are free of charge. Some of the activities require pre-registration. Details are available on the thematic webpage (innocarnival.hk). Members of the public are most welcome to join."
​基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-18 17:30,2025-10-18 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800502.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月十八日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

首宗個案涉及一名17歲女子，住所位於西貢區。初步調查顯示，她於十月十日至十二日到訪廣東省佛山市。她在十月十六日出現發燒、關節痛和皮疹，到將軍澳醫院急症室求醫。她的三名家居接觸者曾一同到佛山市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

​第二宗個案涉及一名55歲男子，住所位於葵青區。初步調查顯示，他於十月八日至十三日獨自到訪廣東省清遠市。他十月十五日出現發燒和關節痛，十月十七日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫。他有三名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

兩名病人均獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他們的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。由於他們在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得41宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：
• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。
​
​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。
​
​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-18 17:30,2025-10-18 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800503.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 18), two new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

  The first case involves a 17-year-old female living in Sai Kung District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Foshan in Guangdong province between October 10 and 12. She developed a fever, joint pain and rash on October 16, and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital on the same day. The patient's three household contacts, who travelled with her to Foshan, are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.
â
âThe second case involves a 55-year-old male living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Qingyuan in Guangdong province alone from October 8 to 13. He has developed fever and joint pain since October 15. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince Margaret Hospital on October 17. The patient has three household contacts, who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

   Both patients were admitted to the hospital for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. Since they stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigations are ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.
  
Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 41 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.
  
  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
  
  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."

​勞工及福利局局長為「心連心」廣東代表處開幕暨粵港澳大灣區社會服務合作項目簽約典禮主禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-18 16:55,2025-10-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800512.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十月十八日）下午在「心連心」廣東代表處開幕暨粵港澳大灣區社會服務合作項目簽約典禮主禮的致辭全文：

尊敬的王利春部長（廣東省委社工部副部長）、周和博士（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室（中聯辦）社會工作部副部長）、管牧（香港社福界「心連心」大行動主席、立法會議員管浩鳴）、還有譚贛蘭教授（香港社福界「心連心」大行動副主席、「心連心」學院院長）、各位來賓、各位朋友：

今日我很高興出席「心連心」廣東代表處的開幕典禮，以及見證粵港澳大灣區社會服務合作項目的簽約儀式，這是「心連心」成立以來其中一個重要的標誌性發展。

「心連心」成立之初主要是連繫香港本地的社福機構，隨着「心連心」的壯大發展，隨着粵港澳大灣區一體化發展，以往是指經濟融合，其實在社福方面，大灣區的互相借鑑、互相融合，都有很多機遇。我在此非常多謝「心連心」，多謝廣東省社會工作部、廣東省大灣區九市的社工部、社工局，也多謝中聯辦，通過過去一段時間的齊心合作，促成今日第一是廣東代表處的成立，第二在成立典禮外，具體有101個項目，牽涉到45間香港的社福機構，有82個是廣東及澳門機構，主要以廣東為主。今日簽約的項目和這101個項目涵蓋了在大灣區九市，我也知道九個城市也有派代表參與，在此我向他們表達衷誠的致謝，很感謝他們抽空來到香港，和我們一起見證今日這個重要的儀式和項目。

「心連心」在廣東有三家代表處，最近我們的在前海，另一個在羅湖，兩個都很近，另一個在廣州海心沙，我親自去了前海的辦事處揭幕，希望有機會也可以去羅湖和在廣州的海心沙代表處。有了「心連心」的代表處後，香港的社福機構和在廣東、尤其是大灣區為主的社福機構的合作，就會更加便利。「心連心」可以作為中間的樞紐，讓大家之間溝通交往，繼而這次有很多服務。當然我們不會自己到內地提供服務，但是跟機構合作的時候，香港的社福機構專業人員可以到內地提供訓練，或者從旁指導，分享經驗，可以切切實實將我們社福的經驗用在大灣區。

我理解今天101個項目牽涉了每一個環節，譬如大家都緊張的精神健康、安老、青少年服務、家庭服務、殘疾人士和復康等，通通都包括在內，待會簽約過程中大家會看得到。這是很好的事，通過我們社福的合作，可以拉近大灣區各自之間的距離，並通過實質項目的合作，建立深厚的友誼和互信，為我們將來的進一步發展打好基礎。

說到大灣區發展，我藉此機會提提其中一個標誌性，由社會福利署做的，在大灣區的廣東院舍照顧服務計劃。如果大家熟悉養老和安老事務就知道，過去我們很多年只有兩家安老院，一家在深圳、一家在肇慶，但隨着過去兩、三年不斷努力，到今日已經有24家院舍遍佈在大灣區差不多九市，只差一個市很快也會有，現時有八個市，香港長者如果想上去大灣區安老，選擇真的很多。現時一共有650位長者已選擇入住，當中13間由香港機構有份參與營運，11間是純屬內地營運，各適其適，適合就可以了。

我在這裏藉此機會祝願今日的簽署合作項目可以早日落地，為粵港澳大灣區的社會服務注入新的動力。相信只要我們一起攜手合力的話，一定可以實現在社福機構和社福服務方面的大灣區的融合。今日只是起步，我相信在不久的將來會見到很實質的成果。我們社福界做事很實在，說完之後就去做，通過我們的實踐，通過我們項目的成果來實現這方面的工作，多謝大家！"

說到大灣區發展，我藉此機會提提其中一個標誌性，由社會福利署做的，在大灣區的廣東院舍照顧服務計劃。如果大家熟悉養老和安老事務就知道，過去我們很多年只有兩家安老院，一家在深圳、一家在肇慶，但隨着過去兩、三年不斷努力，到今日已經有24家院舍遍佈在大灣區差不多九市，只差一個市很快也會有，現時有八個市，香港長者如果想上去大灣區安老，選擇真的很多。現時一共有650位長者已選擇入住，當中13間由香港機構有份參與營運，11間是純屬內地營運，各適其適，適合就可以了。

我在這裏藉此機會祝願今日的簽署合作項目可以早日落地，為粵港澳大灣區的社會服務注入新的動力。相信只要我們一起攜手合力的話，一定可以實現在社福機構和社福服務方面的大灣區的融合。今日只是起步，我相信在不久的將來會見到很實質的成果。我們社福界做事很實在，說完之後就去做，通過我們的實踐，通過我們項目的成果來實現這方面的工作，多謝大家！"
SEE attends Belt and Road Green Innovation Conference in Beijing (with photos),2025-10-18 16:29,2025-10-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800499.htm,"The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, attended the Belt and Road Green Innovation Conference 2025 held in Beijing today (October 18) to share Hong Kong's experiences in green innovation and directions of promoting environmental protection co-operation with the Belt and Road (B&R) counterparts.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the conference, Mr Tse said that the world is facing severe challenges such as climate change in recent years. All parties must adhere to the green development concept, ramp up green transition of the society, and collaboratively reduce carbon emissions and pollution, as well as restore and expand ecology. Green innovation has hence become an important driving force for sustainable development in Hong Kong. It not only promotes new areas of economic growth but also creates job opportunities, fostering social prosperity and development.

""Under the 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the distinctive advantages of enjoying strong support of the Motherland and being closely connected to the world, fully leveraging our role as a 'super-connector' and promoting green development for our country and B&R countries,"" Mr Tse said.

Mr Tse highlighted that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will set up a B&R sustainable green development training centre next year to cultivate international environmental protection talent. The centre will serve as a base to connect the HKSAR with the international sustainable green development co-operation network, creating an environment that promotes technological exchange and outcome transfer for B&R counterparts.

Mr Tse added that the HKSAR Government is proactively preparing for the setup of a B&R Green Development Co-operation Platform in Hong Kong with the B&R Initiative International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC). The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) will establish a regular communication and collaboration mechanism with the BRIGC to facilitate exchanges and discussions with environmental authorities, related organisations and enterprises of the B&R countries, strengthening the international environmental protection co-operation network.

The HKSAR Government holds the Eco Expo Asia at the end of October every year and utilises it as a platform to arrange environmental technology forums and site visits to Chinese Mainland, as well as to strengthen exchange and co-operation. Mr Tse introduced that the 20th Eco Expo Asia to be held in October this year will arrange for representatives from B&R countries to visit outstanding environmental enterprises and facilities in Changsha of Hunan Province. The aim is to more effectively promote green international exchanges and to seek opportunities for high-quality green enterprises from Chinese Mainland to ""go global"".

The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, also attended the conference. He delivered a keynote speech at a sub-forum titled ""Jointly Building Beautiful Cities, Empowering Green Infrastructure with a New Future"" in the afternoon. He introduced the Hong Kong Environmental Database developed by the EPD, showcasing how to enhance environmental assessment and improve efficiency through digital empowerment.

The Belt and Road Green Innovation Conference 2025 was hosted by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, and organised by the BRIGC and the Foreign Environmental Cooperation Center of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The theme for this year is ""Driving Green Development Together"", aligning with the core agenda of the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The conference focuses on the achievements of the Green Silk Road building, building of platforms for exchange and co-operation in green finance, green and low-carbon development, as well as green technology and innovation, which aims to facilitate the integration of green industries with technologies.

Mr Tse will return to Hong Kong this evening."

吳秋北會長（香港工會聯合會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位打工仔女：

大家好！很高興以視頻方式，參與今日的頒獎典禮，恭賀各位「模範之星」在評選中脫穎而出。你們在各行各業以優秀表現閃耀職場，為行業注入動力，為社會樹立榜樣，努力值得肯定。

習近平主席指出，長期以來，勞動模範和先進工作者在促進事業發展、推動時代進步中發揮了示範引領作用。我感謝香港工會聯合會籌辦評選活動，表彰香港行業翹楚盡忠職守、精益求精的精神，不僅弘揚敬業樂業的崇高價值，亦展現敢於創新突破的時代風貌。

在九月公布的《世界人才排名》中，香港由去年的第九位大幅躍升至第四位，是歷來最高排名，更是亞洲之冠。香港勞工專業勤奮、務實靈活，是社會發展和經濟騰飛的重要基石，貢獻遍及各個角落。從民生服務到專業領域，從基礎建設到創科前沿，香港的繁榮足跡，實在有賴廣大打工仔女的智慧與汗水，共同推動社會進步，造福千家萬戶。

改善民生，是我施政的最終目標，因此政府會竭力穩定就業。特區政府一向重視勞工權益，我在新一份《施政報告》中，提出一系列保障措施，包括打擊濫用補充勞工優化計劃、加強個別工種在勞工處招募地點實地招聘，並嚴格限制輸入勞工比例，加大力度打擊非法勞工，以確保本地勞工優先就業。我們亦會完善數碼平台工作者的保障，以及持續加強職業安全及健康。

面對產業轉型加速、科技日新月異，特區政府致力為勞工賦能增值。我們會革新僱員再培訓局，助力勞動人口與時並進，提升競爭力，壯大人才庫。政府將優化再就業津貼試行計劃，釋放本地潛在勞動力。

今年四月，國家舉行全國勞動模範和先進工作者表彰大會，肯定各行業的精英和專家的貢獻。為促進兩地勞動人才經驗交流互鑑，特區政府特別邀請中華全國總工會，組織全國勞動模範和大國工匠代表團下星期訪港。屆時各位國家勞動模範和大國工匠會現身說法，向香港社會分享奮鬥故事與傑出成就。我相信，他們的榜樣力量，能夠鼓勵廣大僱員再接再厲、奮發向上。

香港工會聯合會今次舉辦的活動，表彰行業卓越之風，與國家推崇的勞動模範精神一脈相承。工聯會一直心繫基層，關心廣大打工仔女的權益，並鼓勵他們力爭上游，我肯定你們的貢獻。

各位朋友，勞動創造價值，奮鬥成就未來。我期望各位繼續在自身崗位發光發熱，力爭上游，攜手為行業的進步、為香港的明天努力打拼，續創輝煌。我祝願各位打工仔女事業進步、家庭幸福！多謝大家。"

Speech by CS at 13th Hong Kong Allergy Convention Opening Ceremony (English only) (with photos/video),2025-10-18 13:35,2025-10-18 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800404.htm,"Following is the speech by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, at the 13th Hong Kong Allergy Convention Opening Ceremony today (October 18):

Dr Philip Li (President of Hong Kong Institute of Allergy), Professor Gary Wong (President-Elect of World Allergy Organization), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a pleasure to join the opening ceremony of the 13th Hong Kong Allergy Convention.

This biennial medical gathering has become a highly anticipated event, locally, regionally and internationally. Since it began over two decades ago, the Convention has brought together world experts in allergy. It helps advance knowledge, share best practices and inspire innovation in allergy and immunology.

For that, my thanks to the Hong Kong Institute of Allergy, and its invaluable work over these past 29 years, promoting allergy as a specialty, supporting research and organising events like this two-day international gathering.

This year's Convention theme, ""Allergy Beyond Borders"", reminds us of our shared mission – to cross geographical and institutional barriers for better allergy care worldwide.

Allergic diseases have become among the most common health problems in the world. In Hong Kong, some 400000 patients are being treated for food allergies alone.

And, as you are well aware, allergies know no borders. But allow me to touch on a few of the research areas we're working on in Hong Kong.

In 2021, we established the Hong Kong Genome Institute. Its first major project, the Hong Kong Genome Project, has recruited more than 47000 participants to build a genomic database focused on the South China population, establishing a collaborative platform for researchers, academics and businesses, accelerating clinical trials and drug developments.

We are also speeding up clinical trials and new drug approvals.

The Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, supporting the coordinated I&T development of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, promotes biomedical technology.

It accelerates the evaluation, inspection and clinical trials of drugs and medical devices in alignment with international standards.

We've also established the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute, providing one-stop clinical trial support.

Before year's end, we will establish a new collaboration platform with Shenzhen to provide consultation, matching and referral services for medical research organisations conducting clinical trials in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.

We're reforming drug approvals, too. Through the ""1+"" mechanism, drug companies only need approval from one reference drug authority to apply for registration in Hong Kong. That is, of course, if they are supported by local clinical data and their scope of application is recognised by relevant local experts.

Last month's Policy Address pledged to speed up the ""1+"" mechanism, piloting priority evaluation of innovative drugs recommended by the Hospital Authority for severe or rare diseases.

Ladies and gentlemen, there's much to look forward to over these next two days. And my thanks, once again, to the Hong Kong Institute of Allergy for organising this year's Allergy Convention. I'm also grateful to various organisations supporting the Convention.

I wish you a rewarding Convention and the best of medical research and health in the coming year. And for those joining us from abroad, enjoy a memorable stay in Hong Kong, Asia's world city.

Thank you."

文化體育及旅遊局局長出席「匡智慈善跑樓梯大賽2025」啓動禮致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-18 12:35,2025-10-18 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800336.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（十月十八日）出席「匡智慈善跑樓梯大賽2025」啓動禮的致辭全文：

邱騰華主席Edward（匡智會主席）、Joe（警務處處長周一鳴）、Nikki（信和集團非執行董事黃敏華）、校長、各位嘉賓、各位健兒、各位好朋友：

大家早晨！很高興，感謝Edward邀請，今日可以來參加「匡智慈善跑樓梯大賽2025」啓動禮，其實大家都已經整裝待發。

剛才大家都提及，今年比賽適逢匡智會60周年紀念，在此首先衷心祝賀匡智會，感謝你們在維護智障人士權益方面作出很大的貢獻。

多年來，匡智會一直秉持「匡扶智障」的使命，剛才Edward亦提到，有105個服務單位為智障人士提供特殊教育、復康訓練和輔導就業等多元化服務，協助他們增強自信。我們剛才看到表演時各位的眼神都充滿信心，以及融入社群。匡智會又與商界攜手興辦社企，所以今日也看到很多商界的朋友，讓學員在工作崗位增強自我價值，同時亦可以貢獻社會。

慈善跑樓梯大賽是匡智會年度盛事。剛才Edward提到今年已經是第21年。今屆的主題是「築夢同行Step Up Together」。無論你是捐款的善長人翁，還是親身上陣參賽，又或者與匡智同學組隊參加「共融組」賽事，都希望你們能夠給予同學莫大的鼓勵，亦給予匡智會很大的支持，推動他們今後在人生賽道上，就如跑樓梯一樣，追逐夢想，攀得更高更遠。各位可能會問為何局長今日不一起跑，大家聽到我的聲音有點沙啞，我有少許不適，下次我定必和各位一起跑。

今年的賽制十分多元化，社會各界都可了解智障人士的潛能。剛才提到「共融組」，還有一個十分厲害的七層個人跑，鼓勵更多初階跑手挑戰自我；另外還設有「親子體驗跑」，讓一家大小以創意無限的衣着和造型參賽，寓家庭樂於慈善。

我很高興知道匡智會十分着重學員在藝術和體育方面的發展，並因此成立了「匡智體藝學院」，讓同學有機會參與各項體藝活動和比賽，盡展所長；剛才Edward主席講了關於在藝術方面，在機場大家見到都想購買的畫作，這也是我們希望在機場多推廣不同的本地、不論著名與否的藝術家，又或者匡智同學等的作品，讓全世界的觀眾知道。我談談體育方面，其中匡智會幫助的佼佼者，正是今屆比賽其中一位「匡智共融大使」──陳睿琳。大家可能都會熟悉陳睿琳這名字，她是二○二四年巴黎殘奧會女子S14級100米蝶泳銀牌得主，睿琳在母校的悉心栽培下取得驕人成績，實在令我們十分敬佩和欣慰。

提到殘奧會，大家或者已經聽了很多。今年十二月將會於香港、廣東和澳門舉行全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，一般稱為殘特奧會。這次粵港澳三地舉行殘特奧會，香港作為東道主之一，我們在九月率先舉行了大眾項目當中的輪椅舞蹈。不知道大家有沒有看過輪椅表演舞，關於中國功夫，我們香港的武功和跳舞混合，真的十分精彩，我們的輪椅舞蹈隊取得了三金三銀的佳績。香港將在十二月的殘特奧會中舉辦四個競賽項目，包括殘奧硬地滾球、輪椅擊劍和乒乓球的TT11組，以及特奧項目乒乓球。我邀請各位屆時像今天一樣踴躍捧場，以你們最熱烈的掌聲和歡呼聲，為出戰全運會這全國最高水平體育賽事的殘疾運動員加油助威，支持他們爭取勝利，為港增光。

我祝願「匡智慈善跑樓梯大賽2025」圓滿成功，可籌得更多善款，支持匡智會推展慈善工作；亦希望每位參賽跑手都跑出佳績，享受行善與運動雙重樂趣。祝大家身體健康，多謝大家。"

He also participated in various events, meeting with leaders in the financial sector, major business representatives and think tank figures to brief them on the latest developments and business environment in Hong Kong.

In the morning, Mr Chan attended the plenary session of the Annual Meetings. Later, he joined an in-conversation session organised by the Institute of International Finance, a high-level forum attended by senior executives of various international financial institutions. During the session, Mr Chan shared insights on the current state of Hong Kong's economy, its strategy of development as a financial centre, opportunities in innovation and technology—particularly artificial intelligence—the development of digital assets, and the building of a patient capital ecosystem.

Mr Chan highlighted Hong Kong's unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, including free flow of capital, a freely convertible currency pegged to the US dollar, a highly internationalised market, and close alignment with international best practices. He also emphasised Hong Kong's encouragement of financial innovation. Despite rising global economic uncertainties in recent months, Hong Kong has continued to see capital inflows, reflecting international investors' confidence in the city's investment environment and opportunities.

He noted that Hong Kong is continuously reforming its capital markets to facilitate corporate fundraising and enhance market liquidity, thereby attracting high-quality issuers and investors from both local and overseas markets. At the same time, Hong Kong is embracing financial innovation with a prudent approach, promoting the development of digital assets including stablecoins. He also shared initiatives in nurturing patient capital, including the establishment of the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited (HKIC), which invests early, in smaller-sized enterprises, and with a long-term perspective. The HKIC also mobilises private capital to support innovation and technology industries. Mr Chan said that the HKIC has so far invested in over 130 projects, and for every $1 invested, it has attracted around $6 in co-investment from the market.

At noon, Mr Chan attended a business luncheon co-hosted by the US-China Business Council and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Washington, with over 40 American business leaders in attendance. He delivered a keynote speech, updating participants on Hong Kong's latest economic situation and future development directions, and exchanged views with guests on topics including opportunities in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland.

He stressed that the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement is a significant advantage for Hong Kong and that the Central Government has made it clear that this good system will be upheld in the long run. For example, Hong Kong continues to practise the common law system, and its judiciary exercises judicial power independently. The rule of law in Hong Kong remains highly ranked internationally. In terms of financial innovation, under the ""one country, two systems"" arrangement, Hong Kong is also prudently exploring areas such as digital assets. Regarding innovation and technology development, Hong Kong benefits from access to both Mainland and international data, which is advantageous for research and development activities in sectors like healthcare. This makes Hong Kong particularly attractive to overseas biomedical enterprises.

Mr Chan reaffirmed that Hong Kong will continue to welcome American businesses and talent to invest and develop their careers in the city.

Later, Mr Chan attended a roundtable discussion hosted by the US think tank Atlantic Council, where he exchanged views with representatives from multinational corporations, financial institutions, and local think tanks.

財政司司長在華盛頓出席國際貨幣基金組織和世界銀行年會（附圖／短片）,2025-10-18 10:15,2025-10-18 10:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800180.htm,"​財政司司長陳茂波昨日（華盛頓時間十月十七日）繼續在美國華盛頓行程，參加國際貨幣基金組織（基金組織）和世界銀行集團（世行集團）年會，並出席多場活動，與金融界領袖、主要商界和智庫代表會面，介紹香港的最新發展情況及營商環境。

陳茂波上午出席年會的全體大會。其後，他出席了國際金融協會舉辦的爐邊對談。該活動為高規格論壇，多個國際金融機構的領導層出席。陳茂波分享了香港的經濟近況、金融中心的發展策略、創科尤其人工智能的機遇、數字資產發展，以及構建耐心資本生態等。

陳茂波表示，香港在「一國兩制」下維持資本自由進出、自由兌換並與美元掛鈎的貨幣、高度國際化和與國際最佳標準無縫銜接等優勢，並鼓勵金融創新。近月香港金融市場在全球經濟不確定性增加的情況下，持續錄得資金流入，顯示國際投資者對香港的投資環境和機遇的信心。

他指出，香港不斷通過資本市場改革，便利企業籌融資和提升市場流動性，吸引海内外優質的發行人和投資者參與；亦以穩慎的態度擁抱金融創新，推動包括穩定幣在內的數字資產發展。他同時也分享了香港在培育耐心資本方面的工作，包括成立香港投資管理有限公司，以投小、投早、投長期，並拉動私人市場資金參與，為創科產業提供資金支持。陳茂波指出，港投公司至今投資超過130個項目，而每1港元的投資，拉動了約6港元的市場資金跟投。

陳茂波中午出席美中貿易全國委員會與香港駐華盛頓經濟貿易辦事處合辦的商務午餐會，共有四十多位美國商界領袖出席。陳茂波發表主題演講，介紹香港最新經濟情況與未來發展方向，並與嘉賓就包括香港和中國內地的機遇等議題交換意見。

他指出，「一國兩制」是香港的顯著優勢，而中央政府也表明這個好制度會長期堅持。以法律制度為例，香港繼續實行普通法制度，司法機構一直獨立行使審判權，法治在國際排名中維持高位。又以金融創新為例，在「一國兩制」下，香港也在數字資產等範疇上進行穩慎的探索。創新科技產業發展方面，香港有同時匯聚中國内地和國際數據的優勢，有利醫療健康等的研發活動，對海外的生物醫藥企業，具有相當大的吸引力。

陳茂波表示，香港會繼續歡迎美國企業和人才來港投資和發展事業。

陳茂波其後出席了美國智庫大西洋理事會的圓桌會議，與跨國企業、金融機構和當地智庫的代表交流，介紹香港的經濟金融現況和創科發展、並就貿易、金融、數字資產和創科等領域交流意見。

陳茂波已啓程返回香港，明日（十月十九日）早上抵港。"

天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-10-18 06:47,2025-10-18 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800172.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月十八日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-18 06:47,2025-10-18 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800174.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 18) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

反非法勞工行動拘五十人（附圖）,2025-10-17 20:30,2025-10-17 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700647.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月十日至昨日（十月十六日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「銀翼行動」、「滙力行動」，聯同勞工處進行的「彩虹行動」以及聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」等。行動中共拘捕四十一名懷疑非法勞工、八名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名協助及教唆者。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員搜查多個目標地點，包括建築地盤、裝修中單位及餐廳等，共拘捕四十一名懷疑非法勞工、八名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名協助及教唆者。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十一男三十女，年齡介乎二十四至五十八歲。當中一名男子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）及一名男子涉嫌行使及管有他人身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為三男五女，年齡介乎三十二至六十二歲。被捕的協助及教唆者為一名六十二歲女子。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

在執法的同時，入境處職員亦安排宣傳車及派員於新入伙的住宅屋苑向住戶及物業管理人員派發「切勿聘用非法員工」的宣傳單張，呼籲切勿聘用非法勞工。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。另外，輸入勞工獲准以僱傭身分來港後，必須按『標準僱傭合約』所訂明直接受僱於合約中指定的同一僱主，並擔任合約中指定的職位及在指定的地點工作，而且不可受僱於其他公司或次承判商，亦不可轉換僱主、職位或工作地點（『標準僱傭合約』訂明的工作地點除外）。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

Change of the employer, post or place of work (unless stipulated in the Standard Employment Contract) is not permitted. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged identity card or a identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
文化體育及旅遊局局長出席香港中文大學聯合書院六十九周年院慶典禮致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-17 20:10,2025-10-17 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700712.htm,"​以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（十月十七日）出席香港中文大學（中大）聯合書院六十九周年院慶典禮的致辭全文：

殷巧兒主席（中大聯合書院校董會主席）、王香生院長（中大聯合書院院長）、各位校董、副院長、各位教授、各位嘉賓、各位師兄師姐、各位同學：

大家早上好！很衷心感謝殷巧兒主席——殷師姐和王院長的邀請，讓我有機會再一次以聯合校友的身分回到中大。其實我不久以前也來過一次，就是做《中大校友》的訪問，當時除了走過百萬大道外，亦有機會回到書院，除了一些很熟悉的建築物外，亦看到新的發展，十分開心。剛才院長提到，為何那時候會有這麼多同學在，暑假是「細O camp」的日子，我看到很多正參與「細O camp」活動的同學，都很開心，當然也覺得自己老。我看到同學都是笑容滿面，對於大學生活都有種期盼，回想起自己30多年前，都是這種狀態。我們的工作既是服務香港社會、服務市民，更有種動力是要做得更好，讓一些準備進來（中大）或在座的同學，可以對其生活有更多期盼，對社會將來有更好的期盼。今日回到中大，與各位良師益友、學長學姊以及師弟師妹可以共聚一堂，為的當然是慶祝「聯合書院六十九周年院慶」。能夠參加這個意義非凡的盛會，我十分喜悅，亦非常榮幸。剛才大家介紹我的時候，除了是聯合的校友外，大家亦說是傑出校友，這個不敢當。但是可以見證的一點，就是聯合多年來培育了一代又一代願意為社會出力的學生、畢業生，我只是其中一個。

老套說，時光飛逝，歲月如歌，聯合書院自創立至今，已經走過接近七十年的光輝歲月，比起中大（創立）還要早數年。大家都聽到，中大今年62歲，聯合已經69歲。作為中文大學三所創校成員書院之一，聯合始終秉承以「明德新民」的院訓，以「務實創新，聯合邁進」的精神，致力推動全人教育，促進師生交流，凝聚學生對於中大及聯合書院的歸屬感，作育英才，為社會培育出一代又一代德才兼備的社會棟樑。我身為「聯合人」，時刻以在中文大學聯合書院求學成長為榮，這份歸屬感與自豪，到今日都始終伴我前行。

在眾多傑出的聯合人當中，很榮幸高錕教授是我們其中一位無比敬重的傑出教授。今日跟大家說說高教授。高教授在我就讀母校期間，是中大第三任校長，我的畢業證書校長的一欄是高教授的簽名。其實他在五十多年前，已經毅然放下在英國公司的事業，來到當時仍在香港島的聯合書院，創立了電子系，我們也許覺得，今日有電子系我們可能覺得是理所當然的，現在稱電子工程學系。但那時，沒有人知道甚麼是電子系，電子系在香港算是創先河。高錕教授見學系的研究風氣當時尚未濃厚，便引進外國大學的研究傳統，親自招攬一些留美歸國的學者和教授，亦積極為學生謀出路，引進外部評核，爭取英國工程師學會的認可，促成學生到企業實習，迅速奠定電子系的學術地位與聲譽。

我們更熟悉的是高教授被稱為「光纖之父」，他的非凡遠見徹底改寫了人類文明的進程，並因此榮獲「諾貝爾物理學獎」，貢獻永載史冊。今日，無論是AI（人工智能）、大數據，還是物聯網，無數前沿科技其實都建基於高速傳輸的光纖網絡。可以說沒有光纖，就沒有今日的數位世界。

最重要的是，高錕教授曾說：「我是屬於香港的。」為紀念這位偉大的科學家與教育家，香港最新，同時亦是首個以「藝術+科技」為核心的表演場地——東九文化中心，將會在十一月正式開幕，而開幕時將會隆重呈獻原創音樂劇《一束光 — 高錕的記憶》，這會是我們的開幕節目。這個劇不僅向高錕教授在科研領域的卓越貢獻致以崇高的敬意，更希望充分運用先進的科技設備，結合創意藝術，為觀眾帶來耳目一新的視聽體驗。在此，我要特別感謝母校的大力支持，在這劇的製作過程中提供很多協助，並慷慨借出高錕教授的珍貴物品及資料，讓這部作品可以完美呈現。

高教授追求真理的執著、實踐理想的毅力，他作為科學家與教育家的無私風範，以至他與妻子之間動人的鶼鰈情深，都值得我們每一個聯合人學習、傳承與發揚光大，我誠意邀請大家在十一月中的時候到東九文化中心入場觀賞這套音樂劇，一同走進我們這位傑出聯合人、亦是我們一位前校長的生命故事。

聯合書院的教育向來重視全人發展與多元視野的培養。大家可能都看過早前我在《中大校友》的訪問，當時曾提到聯合書院的通識教育讓我終身受益。聯合書院向來予人「貼地」、多元的感覺，或許我因此亦沾染了一點這種特質。書院當時的「月會」在邵逸夫堂進行，經常邀請不同領域的嘉賓，探討多元化的主題，我提過有外科手術、宇宙大爆炸理論、哲學探索、藝術思潮等，林林總總，橫跨不同領域，引導同學以多元角度思考，拓展認知邊界。這種兼容並蓄、同時亦緊貼生活的教學理念，正是中大，特別是我們聯合書院獨特的一種教育氣質。

剛才院長提及過的宿舍生活，在聯合書院的宿舍生活是我大學歲月裏非常難忘的一頁。我是在三、四年級時入住宿舍，在三年級時候伯宿（伯利衡宿舍），但是四年班的時候，因為新的恒生樓落成，所以我就很開心成為恒生樓第一批的宿生。與現時比較，當時是很開心能夠有恒生樓，就算是要行樓梯上落亦不介意，一定要申請恒生樓。當時經常與來自不同學系的同學食宵夜，有時在校內吃，有時外出到大埔吃，夜話，堅決不睡覺，談甚麼呢？我們那時候很認真，暢談學術，談一些哲學東西，真的激盪思考，你知道「政政」（政治與行政系）很喜歡辯論，一定是辯論至「你死我活」。剛才提到的「文化檢閱」，是我們當時讀理論的人用很多，被稱為Leo Marx的理論，一些很覺醒的理論。我們說很容易，如果在文化當中不覺醒，就會被文化異化，現在還懂得說幾句這些術語，但是坦白說當時我們沒有預料影響這樣深遠。我們舉辦活動，只是希望與大家分享一下文化現象。我們借用湯若望宿舍紅綠歌唱大賽模式主辦晚會，探討流行文化對每個人意識形態的影響。這些經歷當時豐富了我的思考維度，亦可扮得比較酷。想不到數十年後，時至今日仍對我在文化體育及旅遊局的工作帶來深遠啓發，仍記得當日思考的一些事情，現在都要重新思考一遍。

畢業後，我更加體會到，跨領域的知識與視野是在職場中必不可少的致勝之道。我鼓勵各位師弟師妹，在努力學習本科知識之餘，要積極利用這樣好的校園，積極參與跨學科活動，與不同學科的同學多交流合作，拓展不同的興趣與能力，為未來的人生舞台打下更堅實的基礎。

近年來，中大在各項世界大學排名中屢創佳績，這份榮譽屬於每一位中大人，當然包括我們聯合人，是我們代代相傳、堅持不懈、共同努力的豐碩成果。在此，我衷心祝願母校69周年生日快樂，人才輩出，再攀高峰！也祝福在座的師弟師妹勇敢追夢，前程錦繡，在座各位大家身體健康，家庭幸福。多謝各位。"

大家晚上好！非常高興出席今晚的盛會，與各位一同慶祝中華人民共和國成立七十六周年，並見證香港客屬總會第六屆會董會就職。

七十六年來，全國人民在國家帶領下團結奮鬥，取得輝煌成就。中國經濟實力、科技實力、綜合國力強大，國際影響力舉足輕重，與世界各國攜手推動構建人類命運共同體，展現大國擔當。我們每一位中華兒女都深感自豪。

在中華民族多元的大家庭中，客家是一支源遠流長的民系。經歷千百年遷徙，客家人已成為世界上分布最廣的民系之一，為推動中華文明傳承發展、促進世界文明交流互鑑，作出重要貢獻。

香港客屬總會自二○一一年成立以來，一直積極團結客籍鄉親，堅定支持特區政府施政，熱心參與社會事務，同時致力推廣客家傳統文化、培育青年。我肯定各位的貢獻。

客籍鄉親有很多都居於粵港澳三地，是大灣區建設的重要力量。作為國家最高規格綜合體育盛事的第十五屆全國運動會，首次由粵港澳三地共同承辦，還有不到一個月就正式揭幕。

今屆全運會在深圳、梅州、惠州、東莞、清遠在內的著名客家聚居城市，都設有賽區。在香港賽區，我們會在世界級場地啟德體育園，以及中環海濱、維園等地標舉辦賽事。全運會不但是一場體育競技，更是粵港澳大灣區融合發展的生動實踐、是大灣區市民共同展現團結與活力的舞台。我相信各位鄉親都熱切期待這一場「簡約、安全、精彩」的體育盛事。

客籍鄉親對社會的熱誠和擔當，是愛國愛港的重要力量、是推動國家和香港發展的強大因素。接著下來，我希望各位鄉親將力量，投入到對「愛國者治港」至關重要的事務——立法會換屆選舉。剛才，張國榮主席都提醒大家，重要的日子要踴躍投票。

在完善選舉制度後的立法會，過去四年全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，議政質量高、效率高，助力香港對接國家發展戰略，加強香港競爭力。我期待新一屆立法會，承接現屆立法會的良好勢態，進一步彰顯行政主導和「愛國者治港」原則相適應下的良政善治，為香港在創新改革中打開發展新局面。

各位，第八屆立法會選舉的提名期將於下星期五，亦即是十月二十四日展開。我鼓勵愛國愛港立場堅定、熱心服務社會、才德兼備的優秀人才積極參選。全香港市民、全香港社會，包括各位客籍鄉親，都應行使你們的公民權利和履行你們的公民責任，為自己、為香港的利益，在十二月七日投票日踴躍投票，並積極鼓勵你們身邊的家人、朋友、鄉親，都一同為香港這個共同家園投票。

最後，我祝願祖國富強昌盛，香港客屬總會新一屆會董會工作順利。多謝大家！"

Grocery shop owner jailed for employing illegal worker,2025-10-17 19:50,2025-10-17 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700705.htm,"  A grocery shop owner was convicted of charge of being an employer of a person who was not lawfully employable and was sentenced to imprisonment for two months at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts today (October 17).

  During a joint operation against illegal workers conducted by the Immigration Department (ImmD) and the Labour Department codenamed ""Rainbow"" on March 13, 2024, officers of the ImmD General Investigation Section raided a grocery shop and arrested one female Indonesian illegal worker, aged 51, who was found working as a shop assistant. The female was a holder of a recognisance form, which prohibits her from taking employment. She was subsequently sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts.

  During the operation, the grocery shop owner was arrested for employing illegal worker. The grocery shop owner is a Hong Kong resident, male, aged 57. He is charged of being an employer of a person who was not lawfully employable as he did not take all practicable steps to ascertain whether the applicant was lawfully employable prior to employment. After trial, the grocery shop owner was jailed for two months by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts today.

  The spokesman of ImmD reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences.

雜貨店東主因僱用非法勞工被判入獄,2025-10-17 19:50,2025-10-17 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700702.htm,"   一名雜貨店東主因僱用不可合法受僱的人被定罪，於今日（十月十七日）在沙田裁判法院被判入獄兩個月。

   入境事務處（入境處）於二○二四年三月十三日連同勞工處進行「彩虹行動」，打擊非法勞工。行動中，入境處一般調查組人員在一間雜貨店內拘捕一名五十一歲從事店務工作的印尼籍女子。 該名女子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），及後在沙田裁判法院被判監禁十五個月。

   行動中，雜貨店東主亦因涉嫌聘用該名非法勞工而被拘捕。雜貨店東主為一名香港居民男子，年齡為五十七歲。他因並未採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱，被控僱用不可合法受僱的人的控罪。經審訊後，該名雜貨店東主今日在沙田裁判法院被判監禁兩個月。

入境處發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

   市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"
"FEHD welcomes PMSA's release of Best Practice Guides on ""Handling Water Seepage in Properties"" and ""Handling Dripping Air Conditioners""",2025-10-17 19:45,2025-10-17 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700697.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) welcomed the release of the Best Practice Guides on ""Handling Water Seepage in Properties"" and ""Handling Dripping Air Conditioners"" by the Property Management Services Authority (PMSA) yesterday (October 16). The FEHD believes that the Guides, outlining the relevant statutory responsibilities of and regulations to be observed by owners and residents of properties as well as the procedures for property management companies to follow when addressing water seepage and air conditioner dripping issues, will assist licensed property management companies and personnel in resolving water seepage and air conditioner dripping issues within properties.

The Government has been committed to addressing water seepage and air conditioner dripping issues. The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address proposed utilising technology to expedite the identification of seepage sources, requiring property owners to inspect and rectify the problem within a specified time, or else the Government will take further action and recover the costs from the owners. The Government will also actively promote mediation to resolve disputes between residents. In addition, the FEHD has adopted a new strategic approach this year, introducing new technologies to proactively tackle dripping air conditioners across various locations in Hong Kong, achieving notable results.

The FEHD expressed gratitude to the PMSA and the property management industry for their active support in jointly promoting improvements to the environmental hygiene of the community. The FEHD hopes that with the practical guidance provided in these two Guides, property management practitioners can assist in addressing water seepage and air conditioner dripping issues more effectively and enable timely intervention to resolve the issues at an early stage, thereby reducing complaints and disputes, enhancing communication among residents and promoting community harmony.

To encourage the property management industry to refer to the Guides for addressing water seepage and dripping issues within properties, the PMSA will hold a continuing professional development seminar on October 27, where representatives from the FEHD will brief property management practitioners on the details of the relevant investigation work and explain how they can effectively support the department's work.

The Guides on ""Handling Water Seepage in Properties""and ""Handling Dripping Air Conditioners""can be downloaded from the PMSA's website."
食環署歡迎物業管理業監管局發布「處理物業滲水情況」及「處理冷氣機滴水問題」良好作業指南,2025-10-17 19:30,2025-10-17 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700488.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）歡迎物業管理業監管局（監管局）於昨日（十月十六日）發布「處理物業滲水情況」及「處理冷氣機滴水問題」良好作業指南（指南），指南闡述了物業業主及住戶的相關法定責任和需遵守的法規，以及物業管理（物管）公司協助處理樓宇滲水和冷氣機滴水事宜的程序，有助推動持牌物管公司和人員協助解決物業內的樓宇滲水和冷氣機滴水問題。

政府一直致力處理樓宇滲水和冷氣機滴水問題。《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出會利用科技加快確定滲水源頭，要求業主在指定時間內自行檢查和糾正，否則政府會採取進一步行動並向其收回費用，並積極推動以調解方式解決住戶之間的爭議。此外，食環署今年亦採取全新行動策略並引入新科技，積極主動地處理全港多個冷氣機滴水地點，取得一定成效。

食環署感謝監管局和物管業界積極支持，共同推動社區環境衞生的改善工作。署方期望該兩份指南能為物管從業員提供實務指引，讓他們更有效地協助處理樓宇滲水和冷氣機滴水事宜，按指引適時介入，以便及早妥善解決問題，從而減少投訴或糾紛，改善業戶的溝通，促進社區和諧。

為鼓勵物管業界參考指南處理物業滲水和滴水問題，監管局會於十月二十七日舉辦持續專業發展講座，屆時食環署代表會向物管從業員介紹署方進行相關調查工作的詳情，以及物管從業員可如何配合署方的工作。

作為香港首屈一指的創科盛事，香港金融科技周 x StartmeupHK創業節2025由財經事務及庫務局、商務及經濟發展局和投資推廣署聯合主辦，並由香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會、保險業監管局和活動指定承辦商Finoverse合辦。本年活動預計將吸引來自超過100個經濟體，逾37 000與會者，超過800名演講嘉賓及700多家參展機構參與。主論壇將於十一月三日至四日在香港會議展覽中心舉行，規模將創歷屆之最。

今年主題：策動金融科技新時代

香港一直穩居全球三大國際金融中心之列，更是亞洲金融市場的領導者。近年，香港持續推動金融科技發展，最近獲《全球金融中心指數》評為全球第一的金融科技樞紐，足證本港在推動全球金融科技向前邁進的關鍵角色。現時，香港擁有逾1 100間金融科技企業，預計於二○三二年，金融科技行業的總收入將達至6,060億美元，年均增長率高達28.5%。香港金融科技周將持續拓展其國際影響力，進一步鞏固其作為亞洲領先金融科技盛會的地位。

財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇說：「香港金融科技周今年以『策動金融科技新時代』為主題，實際上這也是我們的承諾。我們的承諾不僅在於順應金融科技的未來，更致力於攜手開創全球金融新篇章——實現資本更智慧地流動，讓科技真正解決現實經濟的挑戰。政府會繼續與金融監管機構及金融科技業界緊密合作，致力打造香港成為擁抱和引領金融科技的理想地，建立具規模效益和可持續發展的金融科技方案，推動全球經濟向前邁進。」

Largest-ever Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 to celebrate decade of innovation with world-class line-up (with photos),2025-10-17 19:10,2025-10-17 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101600281.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (October 17) unveiled details of the 10th anniversaries of Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 (HKFW x SMUF), set to take place from November 3 to 7. This strategic alliance marks a decade of innovation while creating an expanded platform dedicated to all facets of technology and business impacts. The joint celebration underscores Hong Kong's commitment to the digital economy, leveraging its position as a leading international financial centre and thriving start-up hub.
  
  As Hong Kong's premier innovation-focused event, HKFW x SMUF is organised by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau (CEDB) and InvestHK, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), and the Insurance Authority, and the appointed event organiser, Finoverse. The event is expected to attract over 37 000 attendees, more than 800 leading speakers and over 700 exhibitors from more than 100 economies. The main conference taking place on November 3 to 4 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre will enable the event to reach its largest scale ever.

This year's theme: Curating the New Fintech Era

  Consistently ranked among the world's top three international financial centres and as a leader in Asia, Hong Kong has taken bold strides to solidify its position as a leader in fintech as well. Hong Kong has recently been recognised by the Global Financial Centres Index as the world's No. 1 fintech hub, a testament to its pivotal role in advancing financial technology around the globe. With over 1 100 fintech firms operating in the city at present, and the sector projected to reach US$606 billion in total revenue by 2032, driven by an impressive annual growth rate of 28.5 per cent, HKFW will continue to expand its global influence, further cementing its position as Asia's leading fintech event.
  
  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""This year's theme of FinTech Week is 'Curating the New Fintech Era'. It is indeed our promise which is Hong Kong not only adapts to the future of fintech but will also shape the next chapter of global finance, where capital flows more intelligently and technology addresses real-world economic challenges. The Government will continue to work closely with the financial regulators and the fintech industry to build Hong Kong as an ideal destination for embracing and leading fintech, with a view to establishing scalable and sustainable fintech solutions that drive the global economy forward.""

A start-up superhighway

  Start-ups attending HKFW x SMUF will gain access to unparalleled resources on a unified platform. The event will foster a thriving community of entrepreneurs, investors, and industry leaders, with thought-provoking content on innovation, emerging technologies, and scaling strategies.
  
  Participants will include start-up founders, investors, and pioneers from sectors such as AI, fintech, green tech, health tech, proptech, and more. HKFW x SMUF will offer opportunities for ventures to secure funding, form partnerships, and break into Asia and global markets.
  
  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said, ""Start-ups are an important part of any economy. Behind every start-up, there must be an innovative business idea. These new ideas call for changes, and refresh our economy. And Hong Kong is just the right place not only for startups to be created, but also for them to grow to scale. Apart from the favourable business environment in Hong Kong, the start-ups here are supported by a strong network of incubators and accelerators, a pool of experienced angels and venture capitalists, a host of government-backed programmes and a welcoming business community."" He added that the number of start-ups in Hong Kong has increased from about 1 600 10 years ago to around 4 700 last year. The impressive expansion is a result of the pro-start-up measures taken by the Government over the years.

A new chapter of creating more together

  The main conference will feature 11 targeted forums with thoughtfully curated programmes. These include the Policy Forum, Visionary Forum, InsurTech Forum, HealthTech Forum, Wealth & Investment Management Forum, Digital Finance Forum, Digital Assets Forum, Blockchain & Web3 Forum, AI & Advanced Tech Forum, China-Global Innovation Forum, and TechX Forum.
  
  The Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, said, ""HKFW x SMUF are much more than conferences. They are strategic platforms driving tangible two-way investment flows and fostering meaningful collaborations. This year, we will welcome over 30 delegations from the Chinese Mainland and overseas, including leading Chinese Mainland tech hubs such as Beijing and Shenzhen, seeking 'go global' opportunities through Hong Kong; traditional markets in Western Europe and the United States, seeking to tap into Asia's growth; and emerging markets from the Gulf Cooperation Council region, ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and Central Europe. Their participation underscores the world's confidence in Hong Kong as the ideal place for innovative ideas to flourish and scale.""
  
  Ms Lau further emphasised that the 10th anniversary is not only a moment to reflect on past achievements, but also an opportunity to chart the future and invite the world to share ideas in Hong Kong's remarkable journey.
  
  This year, shortlisted Global Fast Track programme semi-finalist companies from seven verticals will be invited to the semi-finals and grand finale to pitch in person onstage during HKFW x SMUF. This provides an unparalleled opportunity for innovators to showcase their solutions in front of thousands of attendees, including key corporates, investors, service providers and communities seeking innovative fintech and other tech solutions and investment opportunities. The programme has already received overwhelming interest, with over 700 applications from 70 economies worldwide.
  
  Additionally, appointed event organiser Finoverse will introduce its first AI community host ""Samantha"" at HKFW x SMUF. Through conducting a five-minute live call, Samantha can connect users to targeted meetings and craft personalised forum itineraries according to users' interests and objectives, leveraging a database of 11 forums by a proprietary AI algorithm for precise matches.

海關人員於活動開始前向議員們進行簡介，包括未完稅煙草相關罪行的最高罰則已由罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年，提高至罰款二百萬元及監禁七年；香港將施行完稅標籤制度，以幫助區分已完稅和未完稅香煙，該制度的首階段計劃於二○二六年第四季實施，並於二○二七年第二季全面推行。此外，香港海關已於十月六日起開展為期三個月的完稅標籤制度先導計劃，旨在評估其效能及可行性，並讓業界及市民認識制度的重點內容，為配合該制度早作合規準備。

海關人員亦於屋邨範圍巡查及擺設攤位，向居民派發宣傳品，推廣反私煙信息並鼓勵他們向海關舉報懷疑買賣私煙活動。

海關會繼續根據風險評估和情報分析從源頭堵截，並透過針對貯存及分銷販賣多管齊下的執法策略，致力打擊私煙活動。海關亦會加強宣傳教育，提醒市民切勿參與有關私煙的違法行為。

Hong Kong Customs conducts interdepartmental anti-illicit cigarette publicity activities in Kwun Tong District (with photos),2025-10-17 19:07,2025-10-17 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700584.htm,"Hong Kong Customs conducted a joint anti-illicit cigarette publicity campaign with Legislative Council Member Mr Ngan Man-yu, members of the Kwun Tong District Council, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health and the Housing Department at On Tai Estate in Kwun Tong today (October 17).

Before the start of the event, Customs officers conducted a brief for council members on the increase of the maximum penalty for engaging in illicit cigarettes activities from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment. Moreover, a duty stamp system will be implemented to help distinguish between duty-paid and duty-not-paid cigarettes. The first phase of the system is planned to be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2026, followed by full implementation in the second quarter of 2027. Hong Kong Customs launched a three-month pilot run for the duty stamp system on October 6, which aims to evaluate its effectiveness and feasibility, as well as to promote industry and public awareness of the key features of the system that enable them to prepare for related compliance in advance.

Customs officers also patrolled the estate and set up a promotional booth to distribute promotional items to residents in order to promote anti-illicit cigarette messages and encourage them to report suspected illicit cigarette trading activities to Customs.

Customs will continue its risk assessment and intelligence analysis for interception at source as well as through its multipronged enforcement strategy targeting storage, distribution and peddling to spare no effort in combating illicit cigarette activities. Also, Customs will strengthen publicity and education to remind the public not to take part in unlawful acts related to illicit cigarettes.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/).

In accordance with the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person shall distribute any smoking product advertisement (including any promotional leaflets). Any person who contravenes the regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000. Members of the public may report any suspected activities of illicit cigarette leaflets distribution to TACO's hotline 2961 8823."
"Speech by USEE at partnership dialogue of Science and Innovation Forum of World Food Forum 2025 in Rome, Italy (English only) (with photo)",2025-10-17 19:00,2025-10-17 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700607.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, at the partnership dialogue of the Science and Innovation Forum of the World Food Forum 2025 organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Rome, Italy, today (October 17):

  On the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)'s 80th anniversary, it is my honour to participate in the Partnership Dialogue today. This morning, we witnessed the signing of a Letter of Intent between the FAO and the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government to show mutual commitment to implement the One Health approach. This is indeed the best moment to take stock of the latest developments in the HKSAR.

  In the international arena, the FAO, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations Environment Programme collaborate to drive the transformation required for mitigating the impact of health challenges at the human-animal-plant-environment interface at the global, regional and country level.

  On the HKSAR's part, while our agricultural land is limited, we have embraced various innovative solutions in support of the One Health approach, including in the agrifood systems.

  Back in September 2017, the HKSAR Government organised an International Conference on One Health in the HKSAR as one of the celebration activities for the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR.

  In December 2023, the HKSAR Government announced the Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries, which outlines the Government's vision and work targets to promote the upgrading and transformation of the local agricultural and fisheries industries. I will give two examples under the Blueprint, namely urban farming and a multi-storey pig farm.

  We seek to develop urban farming through a multipronged approach, with a view to integrating commercial agriculture into urbanised areas of the city to produce high-quality and fresh agricultural produce with reduced carbon footprints, and also providing green landscapes and modernised farming experiences to the communities.

  We have pioneered the adoption of high-efficiency hydroponic systems, which boost yield while simultaneously conserving water. These soil-free cultivation systems not only eliminate the need for chemical pesticides but also reduce the risk of plant disease transmission.

  We have recently launched the first pilot urban farm that utilises advanced farming technology in a public park, and will set up modernised hydroponic farms-cum-stalls on suitable rooftops of public markets. These help promote the concept of ""harvest-to-sale"", shortening the supply chains from farms to consumers.

We are also pioneering the development of multi-storey, modernised, and environmental-friendly livestock farming that exemplifies the integration of advanced technology with the One Health principles.

  This innovative vertical farming model harnesses cutting-edge automated systems and smart technologies to enhance biosecurity measures and significantly reduces environmental impact through enclosed, controlled environments. It not only curtails disease risks and reduces reliance on antibiotics but also maximises farming efficiency through precise resource management.

  Our multi-storey pig farm project is scheduled to commence operation around 2032.

  We now come to the prevention of zoonotic diseases. On diseases like avian influenza:


we have a robust, science-drivensurveillance and control programme, actively monitoring the viruses across the entire spectrum -from chicken farms and wholesale markets to pet bird shops, recreational parks and nature reserves;
we have enforced a compulsory vaccination programme on local farms for over two decades; and
with advancements in laboratory technology over the years, analysing local surveillance data and integrating findings from global health networks enable the updating of our designated vaccines in a timely manner to ensure vaccination efficacy.


  The absence of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks on any local farm since 2008 demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

  On antimicrobial resistance, we have been implementing a comprehensive Strategy and Action Plan through close collaboration on human health, animal health and environment fronts. Citing the work of the animal health sector for illustration purposes, the actions include:


systematic surveillance of antimicrobial usage and resistance in livestock;
the formulation of scienceâbased guidelines and farm-specific disease management plans to encourage prudent use of antimicrobials; and
practical support to farmers in strengthening hygiene, vaccination and biosecurity.


  These concerted efforts reflect our commitment to innovation, prevention and integration under the One Health principles. We seek to safeguard human health and animal health and advance a healthier, more resilient, and more sustainable future for all. We will continue to deepen our interdisciplinary collaboration, guided by the One Health principles. In this way, we hope to transform challenges into opportunities and deliver tangible and lasting impact. Thank you."

This is indeed the best moment to take stock of the latest developments in the HKSAR.

  In the international arena, the FAO, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations Environment Programme collaborate to drive the transformation required for mitigating the impact of health challenges at the human-animal-plant-environment interface at the global, regional and country level.

  On the HKSAR's part, while our agricultural land is limited, we have embraced various innovative solutions in support of the One Health approach, including in the agrifood systems.

  Back in September 2017, the HKSAR Government organised an International Conference on One Health in the HKSAR as one of the celebration activities for the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR.

  In December 2023, the HKSAR Government announced the Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries, which outlines the Government's vision and work targets to promote the upgrading and transformation of the local agricultural and fisheries industries. I will give two examples under the Blueprint, namely urban farming and a multi-storey pig farm.

  We seek to develop urban farming through a multipronged approach, with a view to integrating commercial agriculture into urbanised areas of the city to produce high-quality and fresh agricultural produce with reduced carbon footprints, and also providing green landscapes and modernised farming experiences to the communities.

  We have pioneered the adoption of high-efficiency hydroponic systems, which boost yield while simultaneously conserving water. These soil-free cultivation systems not only eliminate the need for chemical pesticides but also reduce the risk of plant disease transmission.

  We have recently launched the first pilot urban farm that utilises advanced farming technology in a public park, and will set up modernised hydroponic farms-cum-stalls on suitable rooftops of public markets. These help promote the concept of ""harvest-to-sale"", shortening the supply chains from farms to consumers.

We are also pioneering the development of multi-storey, modernised, and environmental-friendly livestock farming that exemplifies the integration of advanced technology with the One Health principles.

  This innovative vertical farming model harnesses cutting-edge automated systems and smart technologies to enhance biosecurity measures and significantly reduces environmental impact through enclosed, controlled environments. It not only curtails disease risks and reduces reliance on antibiotics but also maximises farming efficiency through precise resource management.

  Our multi-storey pig farm project is scheduled to commence operation around 2032.

  We now come to the prevention of zoonotic diseases. On diseases like avian influenza:


we have a robust, science-drivensurveillance and control programme, actively monitoring the viruses across the entire spectrum -from chicken farms and wholesale markets to pet bird shops, recreational parks and nature reserves;
we have enforced a compulsory vaccination programme on local farms for over two decades; and
with advancements in laboratory technology over the years, analysing local surveillance data and integrating findings from global health networks enable the updating of our designated vaccines in a timely manner to ensure vaccination efficacy.


  The absence of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks on any local farm since 2008 demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

  On antimicrobial resistance, we have been implementing a comprehensive Strategy and Action Plan through close collaboration on human health, animal health and environment fronts. Citing the work of the animal health sector for illustration purposes, the actions include:


systematic surveillance of antimicrobial usage and resistance in livestock;
the formulation of scienceâbased guidelines and farm-specific disease management plans to encourage prudent use of antimicrobials; and
practical support to farmers in strengthening hygiene, vaccination and biosecurity.


  These concerted efforts reflect our commitment to innovation, prevention and integration under the One Health principles. We seek to safeguard human health and animal health and advance a healthier, more resilient, and more sustainable future for all. We will continue to deepen our interdisciplinary collaboration, guided by the One Health principles. In this way, we hope to transform challenges into opportunities and deliver tangible and lasting impact. Thank you."
Under Secretary for Health chairs 10th meeting of Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding (with photos),2025-10-17 18:48,2025-10-17 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700614.htm,"  The Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, chaired the 10th meeting of the Committee on Promotion of Breastfeeding today (October 17) to review and discuss with members of the Committee the local breastfeeding situation, work progress made by the dedicated working group under the Committee in enhancing baby-friendly measures in maternity hospitals, and matters related to the Hong Kong Breast Milk Bank (HKBMB) established early this year, with a view to formulating strategic directions for promoting breastfeeding.

  At the meeting, representatives of the Department of Health (DH) reported to the Committee the local breastfeeding situation. Breastfeeding rates in Hong Kong have shown significant improvement over the past 25 years. Among others, the breastfeeding rate on hospital discharge reached 81 per cent in 2024, marking a substantial increase when compared to the 55 per cent in 2000. The rate of exclusive breastfeeding until 4 months of age also rose from 8 per cent in 2000 to 18 per cent in 2024. The above figures indicate the wide community support for breastfeeding, as well as the effectiveness of the Government's measures in promoting breastfeeding over the years. Nevertheless, the DH has noted a downward trend in local breastfeeding rates in recent years. Key contributing factors include insufficient self-efficacy and motivation among women to breastfeed, as well as discontinuation of breastfeeding due to work commitments. This reflects that support from partners, family, peers, workplaces, and communities, as well as fostering a breastfeeding-friendly environment and culture, are critical to promoting breastfeeding.

  The first few hours and days after birth are critical for establishing lactation and success of breastfeeding, and the immediate skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby in the delivery suite is particularly important. According to scientific evidence, this helps breastmilk secretion and increases the chances of successful breastfeeding. To strengthen and consolidate the breastfeeding-friendly measures in maternity hospitals (including both public and private hospitals), the Government has specially set up a dedicated working group under the Committee, members of which include representatives from the accreditation body, namely the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative Hong Kong Association, and local maternity hospitals. The Chairman of the working group reported on the work progress at the meeting, including the enhancement of the monitoring system for existing maternity hospitals in the middle of this year to more accurately capture breastfeeding data prior to infant discharge, as well as a detailed assessment and analysis of the implementation of breastfeeding-friendly measures in local maternity hospitals to be completed within this year. Based on this information, strategic recommendations will be provided as appropriate to enhance the implementation of baby-friendly measures.

  In addition, the HKBMB located at the Hong Kong Children's Hospital has officially commenced operations since this January to provide breastmilk for infants and young children who cannot be breastfed by their biological mothers, thereby minimising the chance of serious illness in premature or severely ill babies. Since this March, the HKBMB has supplied processed donated breastmilk to nine public hospitals in Hong Kong equipped with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). As of October 6 this year, the HKBMB had registered 368 breastmilk donors and collected over 2 013 litres of breastmilk to be supplied to extremely premature and critically ill newborns, providing the best possible nutrition. Meanwhile, public hospital NICUs have distributed processed donated breastmilk to 309 infants with clinical needs.

  Moreover, the Committee has proposed two main strategic directions on the promotion, protection and support for breastfeeding based on local circumstances, namely (1) strengthening and consolidating professional support from healthcare institutions, and (2) enhancing support for breastfeeding mothers from various sectors.

  Regarding professional support from healthcare institutions, at present, all eight public hospitals with obstetrics departments are accredited Baby-Friendly Hospitals (BFHs). Two private hospitals offering delivery services have activated the accreditation procedures, with one already accredited. Of the 29 Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) currently providing services under the DH, 15 of them have been accredited as Baby-Friendly MCHCs, with others expected to be accredited gradually starting from next year. The Government will continue to promote breastfeeding-friendly measures in local maternity hospitals and encourages more private hospitals to participate in the BFHs accreditation through the aforementioned dedicated working group.

  As regards to strengthening support for breastfeeding mothers from various sectors, the Government has long been committed to creating a breastfeeding-friendly environment. Apart from the amendments made to the Sex Discrimination Ordinance to prohibit discrimination against and harassment towards breastfeeding women, and the extension of statutory maternity leave from 10 to 14 weeks, the Government also mandated the provision of baby-care and breastfeeding facilities in newly built government premises for public and staff members' use since early 2019. Moreover, since 2017, the Government has included detailed requirements, including the area and number of baby-care rooms and/or lactation rooms that shall be provided in the commercial development projects, in the Conditions of Sale of new commercial land sale sites (excluding land designated for hotel use only). The Government also encourages more enterprises to implement a Breastfeeding Friendly Workplace policy to enable working mothers to continue breastfeeding after returning to work. The DH issued relevant guidelines for employers and employees with specific advice on supporting breastfeeding.

  Dr Fan said, ""Breast milk is the most ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean, and contains antibodies which can help prevent many common childhood illnesses. Protecting breastfeeding is a collective responsibility of the entire society. A mother being able to continue breastfeeding relies on collaboration and support from all sectors of the community. I call upon all sectors of the community to attach great importance to breastfeeding and work together to provide support on all fronts to foster a friendly environment and atmosphere. The Government will continue to promote and support breastfeeding with dedicated efforts, and collaborate with all sectors of the community to increase the sustainability of breastfeeding and enhance the overall maternal and child health.""

  Established in April 2014, the Committee comprises members from relevant healthcare professions and academia as well as representatives of organisations promoting breastfeeding. The Committee is responsible for providing recommendations on the strategies and action plans for further strengthening the promotion, protection and support for breastfeeding as well as overseeing the relevant progress, with a view to enhancing the sustainability of breastfeeding and advocating breastfeeding as the mainstream baby-care mode to be widely accepted by the general public."
醫衞局副局長主持促進母乳餵哺委員會第十次會議（附圖）,2025-10-17 18:48,2025-10-17 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700617.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）副局長范婉雯醫生今日（十月十七日）主持促進母乳餵哺委員會（委員會）第十次會議，與委員會成員檢視及討論本地母乳餵哺情況、委員會轄下專責工作小組就加強產科醫院實行愛嬰措施的工作進展，以及今年年初成立的香港母乳庫的相關事宜，從而訂立促進母乳餵哺的策略方向。

會議上，衞生署代表向委員會匯報本地母乳餵哺的情況。本地的母乳餵哺率在過去25年有顯著改善。其中，二○二四年出院時的母乳餵哺率為81%，較二○○○年的55%大幅提升；純母乳餵哺至四個月大的比率則亦由二○○○年的8%上升至二○二四年的18%。以上數據顯示社區普遍支持母乳餵哺，以及政府多年來致力推廣母乳餵哺的措施成效。然而，衞生署留意到近年本地母乳餵哺率有下降趨勢，主要原因包括婦女對母乳餵哺的信心和動力不足，以及因為工作而放棄授乳，反映伴侶、家人、朋輩、工作間及社區的支持，以及締造便利母乳餵哺的友善環境和文化，對推動母乳餵哺至關重要。

新生兒出生後的最初幾小時和首數天是建立授乳和成功餵哺母乳的關鍵時刻，尤其母親與嬰兒於產房的即時肌膚相親十分重要。根據科學實證，此措施有助乳汁分泌，增加成功哺乳的機會。為加強及鞏固產科醫院（包括公立和私營醫院）的母乳餵哺友善措施，政府特意在委員會下成立專責工作小組，成員包括認證機構愛嬰醫院香港協會和本地產科醫院代表。工作小組主席在會議上報告了工作進展，包括在今年年中已加強現有產科醫院的監察系統，以期更精準地掌握嬰兒在出院前的母乳餵哺數據，以及在今年內為本地產科醫院就母乳餵哺友善措施的實施情況完成詳細的評估和分析，並根據這些資料，按情況提供策略性的建議，加強落實愛嬰措施。

另外，設於香港兒童醫院的香港母乳庫已於今年一月正式投入服務，為未能由親生母親餵哺的嬰幼兒提供母乳，減低早產及重病嬰兒患上重症的機會。母乳庫自今年三月起向全港九間設有新生兒深切治療部的公立醫院供應經處理的捐贈母乳。截至今年十月六日，母乳庫已有368名登記母乳捐贈者，並收集超過2 013公升母乳，供應予極早產及患有危疾的初生嬰兒，讓他們獲得最佳營養。同時，公立醫院的新生兒深切治療部已向309名有臨床需要的嬰兒派發經處理的捐贈母乳。

此外，委員會按本地情況，就推廣、維護及支持母乳餵哺提出了兩大策略方向：（一）強化及鞏固醫療機構的專業支援；及（二）加強各界對授乳母親的支持。

在醫療機構的專業支援方面，現時全港八間設有產科的公立醫院已全部獲認證為「愛嬰醫院」，有兩間提供分娩服務的私家醫院亦已啓動認證程序，當中一間已獲得認證。衞生署轄下正提供服務的29間母嬰健康院中亦有15間獲認證為「愛嬰母嬰健康院」，餘下的預計會在明年陸續獲得認證。政府會繼續透過上述專責工作小組推動本地產科醫院的母乳餵哺友善措施，並鼓勵更多私營醫院參與「愛嬰醫院」認證行動。

至於加強各界對授乳母親的支持方面，政府一向致力建立母乳餵哺友善環境，除已修訂《性別歧視條例》以禁止歧視和騷擾餵哺母乳的女性，並將法定產假由10星期延長至14星期外，自二○一九年初起，政府規定於新落成政府處所設置供公眾和員工使用的育嬰及哺乳設施。此外，政府亦已自二○一七年起，在新推售的商業用地（不包括酒店專屬用地）的賣地條件列出詳細的規定，包括在該等商業發展項目須設置的育嬰間及／或哺乳設施的面積和數目。政府亦鼓勵企業實施「母乳餵哺友善工作間」政策，以便在職母親返回工作崗位後繼續餵哺母乳。衞生署已為僱主和僱員推出相關指引，提供支持母乳餵哺的具體建議。

范婉雯醫生說：「母乳是嬰兒最理想的食物，不但安全衞生，亦含有抗體，有助預防許多常見的兒童疾病。維護母乳餵哺是全社會的共同責任。母親能夠持續餵哺母乳，實有賴於社會各界的協作與支持。我呼籲社會各界重視母乳餵哺，合力提供全方位的支持，創造友善的環境和氛圍。政府將繼續致力推廣及支持母乳餵哺，與社會各界攜手合作，提高母乳餵哺的持續性，促進整體的母嬰健康。」

委員會於二○一四年四月成立，成員來自相關的醫護專業人士、學術界和參與推廣母乳的組織代表。委員會負責就進一步加強推廣、維護及支持母乳餵哺有關策略及行動計劃提供意見，並監督相關進度，以提高母乳餵哺的持續性，並讓母乳餵哺成為社會大眾接受的主流育嬰模式。"
OASES Deputy Director-General visits Beijing to strengthen ties and collaboration with strategic institutions (with photos),2025-10-17 18:45,2025-10-17 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700657.htm,"The Deputy Director-General of the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (OASES), Dr Jimmy Chiang, visited Beijing from October 15 to 17 to meet with a range of strategic institutions, including a research institute, an innovation park, and foreign official trade and investment offices. The visit aimed to strengthen the close ties between Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and international partners, and foster collaboration in innovation and technology (I&T), as well as industrial development.

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" outlines the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government's commitment to actively nurture emerging industries, including advanced manufacturing, life and health technology, new energy, artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. The HKSAR Government will step up its efforts to nurture emerging industries locally and attract those from outside Hong Kong, promoting the diversified development of the economy. Dr Chiang's visit reinforced these policy directions through a series of targeted engagements.

Dr Chiang then visited the Office of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Beijing and met with the Deputy Director, Miss Amy Yuen. They discussed ways to further support strategic enterprises operating in Hong Kong and Beijing, and to enhance regional co-ordination and policy alignment to facilitate strategic enterprise developments.

In the I&T sector, Dr Chiang visited Zhongguancun, a leading innovation hub in Beijing. He toured the Zhongguancun Exhibition Center to learn about the latest local technological achievements and the development of innovative enterprises. He also attended a roundtable at the Zhongguancun Beijing-Hong Kong-Macao Youth Innovation Center, where he engaged with young entrepreneurs and introduced Hong Kong's start-up support policies and funding schemes, encouraging high-potential tech ventures to establish a presence in Hong Kong.

Dr Chiang also met with representatives of the Swiss Business Hub China, under the Embassy of Switzerland in China, to explore opportunities for Swiss strategic enterprises to set up in Hong Kong. Both sides agreed to strengthen information exchanges and investment promotion collaborations, and to jointly explore development opportunities for Swiss strategic enterprises in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

Dr Chiang remarked that the visit was highly fruitful and further reinforced Hong Kong's position as a premier gateway for enterprises around the globe. He emphasised that OASES will continue to align with the policy direction in nurturing emerging industries, maintain close ties with strategic institutions, and attract high-potential enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong, driving long-term growth in I&T and high-value industries."
引進重點企業辦公室副主任訪京加強與戰略機構的聯繫和合作（附圖）,2025-10-17 18:45,2025-10-17 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/17/P2025101700655.htm,"引進重點企業辦公室（引進辦）副主任蔣學禮博士十月十五至十七日赴北京進行訪問，其間拜會多個戰略機構，包括科研院所、創科園區及外國駐華官方商務機構，進一步鞏固香港與內地及國際夥伴的緊密聯繫，並促進與相關機構在創新科技和產業發展方面的合作。
