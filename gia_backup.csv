勞工處發言人今日（八月四日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

如有任何有關職業安全及健康的問題，可致電2559 2297，與勞工處職業安全主任聯絡。"
"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-08-04 06:31,2025-08-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400133.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 4) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

Hong Kong Customs detects two drug trafficking cases at airport (with photo),2025-08-03 20:42,2025-08-03 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300779.htm,"âHong Kong Customs detected two drug trafficking cases involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport today (August 3) and seized a total of about 20 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with a total estimated market value of about $4 million.

The first case involved a non-local male passenger, aged 35, arriving in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, suspected cannabis buds, weighing about 10kg in total, were found inside his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

The second case also involved a non-local male passenger who arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, a total of about 10kg of suspected cannabis buds were seized in the check-in suitcase of the 48-year-old male passenger. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested persons of the first and second case have each been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court tomorrow (August 4).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
新一輪禁毒宣傳展示禁毒新「型」態（附圖）,2025-08-03 19:15,2025-08-03 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300326.htm,"保安局禁毒處舉辦的宣傳活動「禁毒新『型』態」今日（八月三日）下午在油塘「大本型」商場舉行。保安局局長鄧炳強於活動上，向市民介紹新一輪禁毒宣傳的理念，以及撕破「太空油毒品」的假面具，將之正名為依托咪酯。

鄧炳強說，很多人誤以為吸食依托咪酯好「有型」。他要告訴大家，吸毒絕對不「有型」，懂得拒毒才是「有型」！

他表示，毒販刻意美化含有依托咪酯的毒品，藉以誘騙年輕人吸食，令他們忽視這新興毒品對身心的嚴重損害。因此，政府已將這毒品正名為依托咪酯，直接凸顯其毒品的本質。

於活動上，鄧炳強聯同禁毒常務委員會（禁常會）主席李國棟醫生、保安局常任秘書長李百全、保安局副局長卓孝業、署理禁毒專員陳婉嫻和禁常會禁毒教育及宣傳小組委員會主席吳守基主禮，為新一輪的禁毒宣傳揭開序幕。

鄧炳強先帶領署理禁毒專員，撕下道具上印有「太空油毒品」的貼紙，寓意撕破其假面具。鄧炳強隨即聯同其他主禮嘉賓，將印有「依托咪酯」的道具掉入一個有火焰影像的裝置，象徵銷毀依托咪酯這害人不淺的新興毒品。

為進一步宣傳毒品的禍害，禁毒處特意邀請了著名藝人郭富城擔任「榮譽禁毒專員」，並向他頒發委任狀。郭富城更親自創作加入個人特色的特別版禁毒口號「聽我講：企硬唔take嘢！」及禁毒新舞步。活動中，他帶領現場觀眾一起宣讀此特別版禁毒口號及展示禁毒新舞步，展現「向毒品說不」的力量和決心。

郭富城亦即場教授約50位今日獲委任為「青年校園禁毒大使」的年輕人他的禁毒新舞步。「青年校園禁毒大使」將肩負到全港校園宣揚禁毒信息的使命，以將禁毒精神帶入校園。

為讓公眾清楚了解依托咪酯的禍害，例如吸食者會全身抽搐、神志不清、皮膚潰爛、身體不受控等類似「喪屍」的狀態，令吸食者的醜態盡露，尊嚴掃地，成為人生中難以磨滅的污點。新一輪宣傳以「依托咪酯──食咗變喪屍！死咗無人知！」為主題，相關的政府電視宣傳短片及宣傳聲帶已於各電視台及電台播放。有關廣告和宣傳品亦會於公共交通網絡、大型戶外廣告位、戲院、公共屋邨、私人屋苑、社區客廳和新界鄉村等地方展示，亦會於受歡迎的流動應用程式及網站推送給手機用戶。有關依托咪酯的資料已上載保安局禁毒處的專題網頁（www.nd.gov.hk/tc/etomidate.html）供大眾參考。

而警方增設的打擊依托咪酯24小時舉報熱線（號碼：6629 2966）亦已投入運作，以與市民一起合作打擊依托咪酯相關罪行。另外，市民亦可透過即時通訊程式WhatsApp（號碼：6629 2966）或微信（帳戶：eto-report）作出舉報。

今日的宣傳活動亦包括分享環節，由醫院管理局香港中毒控制中心顧問張耀君醫生向觀眾講解依托咪酯的毒害，以及由專業舞台劇演員上演的禁毒互動小劇場，透過生動有趣的手法，宣揚遠離依托咪酯的信息。"
"""Anti-Drug, New Era"" showcased in new anti-drug publicity campaign (with photos)",2025-08-03 19:15,2025-08-03 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300400.htm,"  The publicity event ""Anti-Drug, New Era"" organised by the Narcotics Division (ND) of the Security Bureau was held at the Domain shopping mall in Yau Tong this afternoon (August 3). The Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, introduced the concept of a new anti-drug publicity campaign to members of the public at the event, and talked about tearing down the facade of ""space oil drug"" and renaming it as etomidate.

  Mr Tang said that many people have mistakenly believed that vaping etomidate is ""cool"". He wanted to tell members of the public that drug abuse is definitely not ""cool"". Knowing how to say no to drugs is ""cool""!

  He said that drug traffickers had deliberately glorified etomidate-filled drugs, in order to lure youngsters into taking them and ignoring the serious harmful effects this type of emerging drugs posed to their physical and mental health. The Government has therefore renamed the drugs as ""etomidate"" to state clearly their nature as dangerous drugs.

  MrTang, together with the Chairman of the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN), Dr Donald Li; the Permanent Secretary for Security, Mr Patrick Li; the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk; the Acting Commissioner for Narcotics, Ms Jenny Chan; and the Chairman of the ACAN Subâcommittee on Preventive Education and Publicity, Mr Wilfred Ng, officiated at the event to launch the new anti-drug publicity campaign.

  MrTang first led the Acting Commissioner for Narcotics to tear off a sticker printed with ""space oil drug"" on a prop, symbolising the tearing down of its facade. Together with other officiating guests, Mr Tang then placed the prop printed with ""etomidate"" into a device with simulated flames, symbolising disposing of this harmful emerging drug, etomidate.

  To further raise awareness about the harmful effects caused by drugs, the ND has especially invited renowned artiste Aaron Kwok to take on the role of ""Honorary Commissioner for Narcotics"", and Aaron Kwok was presented with an appointment certificate. Aaron Kwok has designed a special edition of anti-drug slogan with his personal style: ""Hear me out: Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!"" as well as new anti-drug dance moves. At the event, he led the audience to chant this special edition of anti-drug slogan and demonstrated the new anti-drug dance moves, showcasing the strength and determination to ""Say No To Drugs"".

  Aaron Kwok also taught about 50 youngsters, who were appointed as ""School Anti-drug Youth Ambassadors"", his new anti-drug dance moves on the spot today. The ""School Anti-drug Youth Ambassadors"" will undertake the mission to spread anti-drug messages in schools across Hong Kong, bringing an anti-drug spirit to campuses.

  The new publicity campaign aims to give members of the public a clear understanding of the harmful effects caused by etomidate, which include ""zombie-like"" symptoms such as seizures, mental confusion, skin ulcers and loss of body control. Being in this terrible state in public strips abusers of all dignity, and their lives could be tainted. The new publicity campaign is on the theme ""Etomidate - Don't vape it or you'll die like a zombie!"", its relevant Government's TV and radio Announcements in the Public Interest (APIs) have been launched on various television and radio channels. In addition, the relevant advertisements and publicity materials will also be displayed on public transport networks, large outdoor advertising spaces, cinemas, public housing estates, private housing estates, Community Living Rooms and villages in the New Territories, etc. The advertisements will also be pushed to mobile phone users on popular mobile application websites. Information about etomidate has been uploaded onto the dedicated webpage of the ND of the SB (www.nd.gov.hk/en/etomidate.html) for reference by the public.

  To combat etomidate-related crimes with members of the public together, the Police have set up a 24-hour etomidate reporting hotline (number: 6629 2966), which is now in operation. Members of the public can also file reports via the instant messaging applications WhatsApp (number: 6629 2966) and WeChat (account: eto-report).

  The publicity event today also featured a sharing session, in which the Consultant of the Hong Kong Poison Control Centre of the Hospital Authority, Dr Chong Yeow Kuan, explained to the audience the harmful effects caused by etomidate. Professional theatre actors also performed an interactive anti-drug drama to promote the message of staying away from etomidate in a lively and engaging way."

衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案,2025-08-03 17:30,2025-08-03 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300603.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月三日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱個案，屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

中心今日再次就基孔肯雅熱去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意從受影響地區外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現懷疑病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。此外，對於出現基孔肯雅熱典型臨床症狀的患者，不論是否有旅行史，醫生應根據臨床判斷考慮安排檢測。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）已加強確診病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪地點的防蚊滅蚊工作。同時，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today,2025-08-03 17:30,2025-08-03 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300602.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 3) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the CF case in recent days. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of one CF case was recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

Today, the CHP issued another letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong regarding CF to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel to affected areas. If there are suspected CF cases, they should immediately refer the patients to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures. Moreover, for patients with typical clinical symptoms of CF, irrespective of their travel history, doctors should consider to arrange testing based on clinical judgment.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public that if they return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. Members of the public should closely observe personal health conditions, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrange appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has intensified anti-mosquito measures at the residence of the confirmed patient and the locations visited after the onset of illness. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces as well as removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The latest gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas are available on the department website at:https://www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Ovitrap_Index_Update.html#.

The CHP will collaborate with the FEHD to hold an online live seminar on its Facebook page on Tuesday (August 5) from 8pm to 8.30pm, to provide information and health advice on preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquito breeding, as well as addressing related public inquiries. Members of public are welcome to attend.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."

行政長官出席二○二五年《施政報告》地區諮詢會後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-08-03 15:15,2025-08-03 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300530.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（八月三日）出席二○二五年《施政報告》地區諮詢會後，聯同財政司司長陳茂波和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶會見傳媒的談話內容：

行政長官：首先非常多謝各位傳媒朋友在兩個星期日來到採訪《施政報告》地區諮詢會。

地區諮詢會是《施政報告》諮詢的重要部分。我在此多謝兩個星期日出席地區諮詢會的 240多位來自不同背景人士，他們今日雨天也到來，我很多謝他們發表很多寶貴的意見。

出席地區諮詢會的人士來自社會各個界別，包括青年、中產、退休人士、少數族裔、基層、專業人士和殘疾人士等，關注的議題很廣泛，包括土地房屋、交通運輸、創科、金融、文體旅、教育、青年發展、醫療和社會福利等。兩次諮詢會的主題都是「拼經濟謀發展」和「惠民生建未來」。

我和團隊重視地區諮詢會，與各區市民直接交流，聽取大家最關注、最希望處理的問題，這對於政府制訂政策，判斷資源運用的優次，很有幫助。

過去三年的《施政報告》都有不少措施是吸納了地區諮詢會的意見的。

今年《施政報告》公眾諮詢在六月十六日開始之後，至今大約一個半月。我們已經舉辦了超過40場諮詢會，接觸的不同人士包括商界和專業界別 、同鄉組織、青年代表、宗教界、公務員團體、立法會議員、全國人大代表和政協委員等。連同市民在其他途徑提供的意見，包括專題網站和社交媒體、電話熱線、電郵、傳真及郵遞等，我們至今共收到超過5 500份意見書，較去年諮詢的同期多接近百分之十，多謝市民重視和支持《施政報告》的公眾諮詢。

我感謝大家踴躍建言獻策，意見很有啓發性。經過差不多一個多月的諮詢後，我有三點體會：

第一，市民普遍認同本屆政府敢於改革，處理多年的「老、大、難」問題。在諮詢期間，市民大致認同本屆政府積極推出改革措施，包括制訂「簡樸房」制度，取締多年的劣質「劏房」，提出規管網約車的立法建議，決心解決多年網約車法律空白的問題等。有很多市民亦鼓勵我們繼續努力，並提及他們很高興見到香港在很多國際評級方面不斷上升，包括世界競爭力、安全城市等，他們認為這些都是最客觀的成績表。

第二，政策要宏觀微觀兼備。宏觀方面，我們要發展經濟，但要以微觀政策改善民生。這點使我更重視在制訂政策時要照顧細節，平衡利弊，更要多做解說，令市民感覺到政策帶來的正面效益，令他們覺得有認同感和獲得感。

第三，社會重視北部都會區發展，支持我提出要加快發展北部都會區，認同北部都會區是我們未來發展的新引擎，應該以破格思維，只要安全又有效益，無論任何地方的建造方法和用料，都可以採用，要引入新理念、新辦法，提速提效發展。

現在，香港正處於經濟轉型期、外圍環境依然有很多不確定性，但香港機遇大於挑戰。

香港經濟整體正面發展，今年第二季增長百分之3.1，是連續兩年半 錄得正增長；全職僱員每月就業收入中位數在三至五月是2萬5千元，按年上升約7%。上半年的商品整體出口貨值按年上升12.5%。第二季私人消費開支恢復溫和增長，按年上升1.9%。

剛在星期三發表的《香港營商環境報告》，反映國際投資者對香港的信心再進一步提升，例如港股今年以來上升27%，IPO（首次公開招股）集資額按年上升約 6倍；境外來香港的公司接近1萬家，創歷史新高，香港在全球競爭力和國際金融中心排名，都位列全球三甲。這些數字和排名，反映政府方向整體正確。

香港經濟正經歷轉型階段，有行業做得更成功，亦有行業面對挑戰，各行各業在調整進程會有不同步伐，但經濟轉型會使將來經濟更強大。

過往香港經歷過多次經濟轉型，從大笪地時代賣大光燈可以賣到成行成市成為當年的百萬富翁，但到商場林立，大光燈變得式微；從打字機轉型到電腦時代；BB傳呼機由每人必備轉型到現在每一個人都有手提電話，完全被取代，這些轉型會為我們帶來更進步、經濟發展更強大的結果。

轉型期間會出現更替，但行業之後發揮會更進步。經濟轉型不單不能逆轉，更是我們唯一打贏競爭對手的唯一出路，亦是使我們經濟更強大的必經之路。在經濟轉型的路上，有人跑得更快，但有人需要我們扶着一起走，但香港的經濟正是正面發展，世界其他不同地方、城巿面對的挑戰比我們更大。香港人有韌力、有方法，加上國家對香港的全力支持和愛護，只要我們求進求變，我們就能夠戰勝對手，發展得更好，生活有更好保障。政府會制訂積極政策，創造機遇，亦會支援面對壓力的企業，帶領社會乘風破浪。

我很高興聽到不同商會代表提出很多升級轉型的好建議，例如加快發展電商業務，做好客戶數據分析，提供更多個性化的產品，提高顧客忠誠度等。

《施政報告》將於九月發表，我和團隊正密鑼緊鼓，細心研究市民的不同意見。

接下來，我們將繼續舉行多場《施政報告》諮詢會，亦會到社區探訪，多聽市民不同意見。多謝大家。

記者：特首你好。你提到政策落實需要打通任督二脈，經過兩場地區諮詢會之後，你感覺市民最關心的問題和希望在《施政報告》中作出的哪些政策方向，以解決這些問題？第二個問題，就是你剛才提及經濟轉型，最近有勞工界人士提到輸入外勞政策影響本地工人受僱，尤其是餐飲、零售方面，但同一時間，亦有商界人士說因為輸入外勞太遲，所以才導致出現結業現象，政府對這些意見有甚麼看法？有甚麼措施可以平衡勞資雙方的利益？如何優化輸入勞工政策？

行政長官：市民的問題往往是很直接的，即是說在生活上也好，在日常上班也好，都是他們最直接希望我們解決的問題，包括涉及交通運輸、醫療、教育，或是社區設施等。這方面的意見我在其他的諮詢會都有聽到，而每一屆的諮詢會都有提及在地區方面，市民生活日常所經歷而需要我們解決的問題，我覺得這些是重要的，亦因為如此，我們與市民接觸交流都是要聽這些意見。

在十五個政策局當中，所涉及的很多範疇在地區真真正正落地時，市民希望我們縱然有進步，但都要做得更好。例如，剛才所說在醫療方面，我們推出基層醫療健康計劃，我們看到很有進步，包括把市民從整體重治療，某程度上開始改變為社會重預防、重管理自身健康。整體來說，對我們的醫療發展很重要。

另外，無論我們發展得怎樣好，市民真真正正感覺到發展是否好，就與他們日常的生活有關，例如交通配套是否足夠。所以在地區治理中，我們要知道例如在某處是否需要建立一些方便需要幫助的人士，例如輪椅使用者，哪些位置可以方便推過馬路，又或者交通燈配置如何改良等，這些都是重要的。民生問題方面，例如，地區衞生，剛才亦有提及滴水問題，這些都是重要的。

但這些關乎落實政策、整體各個部門的執行能力，所以我希望進一步提升政府的執行能力。我亦因此提出以結果為目標，就是當政府同事們考慮如何落實政策或實實在在的地區服務時，並不只是考慮我們自己做了甚麼工作，更重要的是看看市民希望我們幫助他們解決甚麼問題。所以，每個政策局涉及的都有民生問題，剛才提及市民最希望我們解決的就是民生問題。

但民生問題屬於微觀性問題，一定要與宏觀的整體發展對接起來。因為如果我們的餅做大，多些就業，而且每一個就業的機會或效益帶來更好的收入，這都令大家生活得更好。我們會創造更多發展機會，開拓新市場，令整體經濟發展得更好。

同時，我們都會顧及廣大勞工面對的問題。整體香港發展由於我們的人口增長率不大，甚至亦有出現較為老化的問題，勞動力一定要保持，確保我們的經濟增長。而二○一八年之後，我們的勞動力人數亦開始下跌，所以在有需要幫助的行業中，我們要作出幫助，無論在資助或是有適當的勞工數目令其行業可以運作。

剛才我說在經濟轉型中，有些是行業做得更好，有些行業需要幫助，要幫助的行業，例如包括建造業，政府已經加大投入公共工程，我們已經將每年的900億元工程提高到1,200億元。這除了創造就業，我們亦希望整體發展會更好。

每一個環節中，經濟轉型會需要不同的人力，有些亦是因為更替的理由，某些行業有些勞工亦需要轉工，過程中，亦會影響整體就業情況。在不同環節要用較精準的方法處理，在這方面，我們會持着一個原則，既照顧不同行業的需要，亦照顧整體勞工的問題。

記者：行政長官，你好，有兩條問題想問。至今沒有一支的士車隊的的士數量達到理想的發牌門檻，特首你覺得這個情況是否理想？我們報館日前報道，多區的士車隊的專屬車位被非車隊的士和白牌車長期霸佔，會否令車隊失去賣點？警方方面有否抄過牌？抄了多少？第二條問題，港島區和新界區的政府辦公室會轉用內地品牌水，有公務員擔心水質安全，因為其中一個品牌被內地官媒三年來有六次上過黑名單，安心不等如安全，如何可以令你的公務員團隊可以放心使用內地的品牌水？

行政長官：我首先談談在的士提升服務方面。多年來，很多市民對於的士服務希望達到的水平，在的士服務方面，我們覺得未必完全達到市民的要求，所以我們跟業界一起提升的士服務。過往這麼多年，的士都是一個很自由的行業，即是很多都是單一的士或營運者運作，就是因為這原因，在管理方面是難以做到，所以我們提出用車隊提升的士管理。現時我們的制度已經要求的士提升多方面的服務，包括的士車輛的質素，以及在的士車輛中有攝錄機，以確保服務達標，我們亦要求有行車紀錄，當有任何管理方面的問題，可以針對問題提升不同方面的要求，我們有數據，亦希望經過車隊有良好管理，將整體服務提升。目前來說，雖然在初階有磨合期，但我聽到很多用過車隊服務的市民覺得態度不錯，很有禮貌，亦將一些實際大家想了解的問題，大家都有溝通，這方面我覺得是進步中。當然，經過車隊初期磨合期的營運，我相信的士車隊會做得更好。至於其他細節問題，我請運輸及物流局局長跟大家作交代。

運輸及物流局局長：正如行政長官剛才所說，的士車隊是的士行業改革創新的重要一步。隨着五隊車隊在七月底前陸續一一落地，相信市民都見到越來越多車隊不同品牌的車輛在市面上行走。目前來說，因為是剛剛推出，各車隊會繼續積極招聘司機或有加盟司機加入，相信有關供應會一路陸續增加。很開心見到不同市民第一時間嘗試透過網約預約車隊車輛，最重要是車隊負責人會跟進客戶服務的問題和細節，不停改進及提升。

至於在不同地方，例如機場、口岸，特區政府已安排約80個專屬車位供他們上落客。我們會循改善提升指示牌、加強宣傳，以及運輸署與警方方面的協調和執法，令市民上落更方便。多謝。

行政長官：有關飲用水的問題，我們當然非常重視安全，而招標制度亦充分說明我們的要求是嚴格的。首先，任何人投標都必須有一個認證，這是獨立實驗室對於水質安全的認證，是必須提供的。另外，我們亦有制度要求它在不同時段再提交認證，即不是只在招標時，其安全有認證書確立後就一次過，我們會不時要求它再提供認證。而事實上，我們亦有抽驗制度，有關當局不時都會抽驗其水質安全。在這方面，如有發覺任何不符合標準，我們可以即時取消跟它的合約關係。我們在任何制度方面的安全標準是嚴格的，安全標準是世界標準，所以在這方面，我對整個制度有效而且嚴格執行很有信心。多謝大家。"
