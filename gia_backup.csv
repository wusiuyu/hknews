立法會十三題：輸入體育專才,2025-07-02 11:22,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200288.htm,"以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上鄭泳舜議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

據報近年先後有多位國際及內地體壇名將透過優秀人才入境計劃（優才計劃）或高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）來港發展或定居。有意見認為本港具備匯聚體育人才的優勢，政府應進一步協助來港發展的體育專才，以推動本港體育產業的發展。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年有多少名海外及內地運動或體育專才分別透過優才計劃及高才通計劃申請來港發展，以及當中獲批的個案宗數為何，並按專才所參與的運動項目列出分項數字；有否統計，獲批個案專才在港的就業情況；

（二）體育專才透過優才計劃或高才通計劃來港後，香港人才服務辦公室會如何跟進他們在港的發展和需要（包括曾為該等專才提供的支援服務及發展策略（如有））；

（三）據報過去一年有多位國際知名的桌球運動員先後透過優才計劃成為香港居民，當局會否考慮展開深化工作，協助該等桌球運動員在港推廣桌球或發展桌球事業，例如開辦桌球室或訓練班等，以帶動香港成為「國際桌球之都」；及

（四）會否考慮優化優才計劃或高才通計劃，或提供誘因（例如為短期或長期來港的一些國際體壇名將或體育專才提供稅務優惠），以吸引更多國際體育人才來港發展？

答覆：

主席：

為打造香港成為國際高端人才集聚高地，政府正推行各項不同定位的人才入境計劃，積極招攬多元背景的人才來港，建立優質人才庫以配合香港發展所需。

其中，優秀人才入境計劃（優才計劃）下的「成就計分制」旨在吸引具備超凡才能或技術並擁有傑出成就的人士來港定居，申請人須曾獲得傑出成就獎（例如奧林匹克運動會獎牌、諾貝爾獎、國家／國際獎項），或者可證明其工作得到同業肯定或對所屬界別的發展有重大貢獻（例如有關行業的終生成就獎），才符合「成就計分制」的申請資格。成功獲批的人士一般首次入境可獲准在港逗留八年。過往，絕大部分曾在大型運動賽事獲獎並已來港發展的國際及內地體壇名將，均透過上述渠道獲批來港。

就議員的提問，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局及入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年），優才計劃下成功通過甄選程序的獲批個案中，共有42名退役或現役運動員按「成就計分制」獲批來港，包括不同運動項目的奧林匹克運動會獎牌得主、亞洲運動會獎牌得主，以及其他國際體育賽事的得獎者。

由於高端人才通行證計劃（高才通計劃）旨在吸納高收入或全球頂尖學府學士畢業的人才，入境處並不掌握來自退役／現役運動員的申請數目。

經優才計劃或高才通計劃來港的人士無須在來港前已在港覓得工作。在首個簽證有效期間，人才如在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，亦無須通知入境處。高才通計劃的獲批申請人在提出延長逗留期限申請時，須向入境處提供可信納的資料及文件，證明已在港受聘或開辦／參與業務，方可獲得續簽。入境處沒有備存上述兩個計劃下獲批申請人剛來港時的就業情況，以及提問涉及的其他分項統計數字。

（二）香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）自二○二三年十月三十日成立以來，一直以線上及線下形式，為不同人才入境計劃（包括優才計劃及高才通計劃）下來港／留港的人才提供全方位一站式支援。除設有線上平台（www.hkengage.gov.hk）提供有關在港生活及工作的全方位資訊，以及處理人才的查詢外，人才辦與合作夥伴舉辦多元化的線上線下活動，包括招聘會、專題研討會、工作坊（包括粤語學習班），以及社區共融活動（包括人才義工計劃），提供有關不同生活範疇、就業及創業等方面的資訊，協助來港人才落戶香港，以及盡快融入香港生活。線上平台連繫約90家指定合作夥伴，提供網上支援配對服務，在求職、住房、教育、綜合移居、銀行及保險服務、商務及企業服務和社群網絡等方面為人才提供建議和服務。

早前，不少國際知名的體育專才（如世界排名第一的桌球手卓林普（Judd Trump）及前美國職業籃球聯賽球員馬布里（Stephon Marbury））落戶香港，人才辦即邀請他們參與宣傳，親身分享來港的原因，對外宣傳及推廣香港的獨特優勢和發展機遇，吸引更多國際多元人才來港發展。

（三）多位國際知名的桌球運動員來港定居，帶動市民對桌球運動的關注與興趣。政府會積極推動本地桌球運動的發展，與來港發展的桌球名將保持聯繫，並在他們有需要時提供適切支援，攜手促進本地桌球運動的發展。

政府一直致力推動體育發展，積極落實普及化、精英化、盛事化、專業化和產業化五大政策目標。在推廣體育普及化方面，政府透過舉辦多元化的康樂體育活動，鼓勵市民參與，在社區建立熱愛體育的文化，協助他們培養健康生活模式。

政府亦會繼續投放資源，拓展熱愛體育（包括桌球運動）的觀眾群，並透過「M」品牌計劃支援主辦機構舉辦大型體育活動。今年三月，大型體育活動事務委員會向「世界格蘭披治桌球大獎賽2025」頒授「M」品牌認可。這項大賽首次在英國以外的地方舉行，不但有助推動本地桌球發展，而且彰顯香港作為國際體育盛事之都的地位。

（四）香港需要來自各行各業和具備不同技能的人才，難以為所有經優才計劃或高才通計劃來港發展的人才提供財政誘因或稅務優惠。香港在「一國兩制」下，擁有得天獨厚的優勢，既有祖國的強大支持，又與世界緊密相連。此外，香港亦擁有世界一流的營商環境、簡單的低稅制、高度開放的國際化市場等制度優勢，為香港的發展奠定了堅實的基礎。這些優勢也讓香港成為人才尋求個人成長和自我提升的理想之地，他們可以將創新理念付諸實踐，為世界帶來積極的改變。許多專業人士也選擇以香港為基地，探索內地的發展機遇。相關政策局和部門會繼續與行業的持份者保持緊密聯繫，了解行業最新發展及人力需求情況，持續完善招攬人才措施，例如為重點吸納從事特定行業的外來人才，提供針對性的支援。"
LCQ13: Admission of sports professionals,2025-07-02 11:22,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200290.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Vincent Cheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

 It has been reported that in recent years, several international and Mainland sports stars have come to Hong Kong for development or settlement one after another through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) or the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS). There are views that Hong Kong possesses the advantage of attracting sports talent, and the Government should further assist sports professionals coming to Hong Kong for development, so as to promote the development of Hong Kong's sports industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of overseas and Mainland sports professionals who have applied over the past five years for coming to Hong Kong for development through QMAS and TTPS respectively, and among them, the number of applications approved, together with a breakdown by the sports disciplines in which the professionals are involved; whether it has compiled statistics on the employment status of professionals in Hong Kong in the approved cases;

(2) when sports professionals have come to Hong Kong through QMAS or TTPS, how the Hong Kong Talent Engage will follow up on their development and needs in Hong Kong (including support services and development strategies (if any) provided to such professionals);

(3) as it has been reported that several world-renowned billiard players have become Hong Kong residents one after another through QMAS over the past year, whether the authorities will consider launching further initiatives to assist these billiard players in promoting billiards or developing their careers in billiards in Hong Kong, such as opening billiard saloons or training programs, so as to help Hong Kong become an ""international billiard hub""; and

(4) whether it will consider optimising QMAS or TTPS, or providing incentives (such as providing tax concessions to international sports stars or sports professionals coming to Hong Kong on a short-term or long-term basis), so as to attract more international sports talent to come to Hong Kong for development?

Reply:

President,

 To build Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent, the Government has been implementing various talent admission schemes with different positioning to proactively trawl for talent with diversified backgrounds to come to Hong Kong to build a quality talent pool for meeting Hong Kong's development needs.

 Among them, the Achievement-based Points Test (APT) under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme (QMAS) aims to attract individuals with exceptional talents or skills, as well as outstanding achievements, to come to Hong Kong for settlement. To be eligible for APT, the applicant must have received an award of exceptional achievement (e.g. Olympic medal, Nobel prize, national/international award) or can show that his/her work has been acknowledged by his/her peers or have contributed significantly to the development of his/her field (e.g. lifetime achievement award from industry). Successful applicants will normally be granted a stay of eight years upon first entry. In the past, the majority of international and Mainland sports celebrities who had won awards in major sports events and had come to Hong Kong for development were admitted through the above channel.

 Our reply to the Member's questions, in consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Immigration Department (ImmD), is as follows:

(1) In the past five years (from 2020 to 2024), among the approved cases that have successfully passed the selection exercise under theQMAS, a total of 42 retired or serving athletes have been approved to come to Hong Kong under theAPT, including Olympic medalists, Asian Games medalists, and winners of other international sports events.

 As the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) aims to attract individuals with high income or full-time bachelor's degree from top universities/institutions around the world, the ImmD does not have the number of applications from retired/serving athletes.

 Persons admitted to Hong Kong under the QMAS or the TTPS are not required to have secured offers of employment before coming to Hong Kong. During the validity period of the first visa, the talent are not required to inform the ImmD when they are employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong. When applying for extension of stay, successful applicants under the TTPS are required to provide the ImmD with concrete supporting information and documents to prove that they have been employed or have established/joined in business in Hong Kong so that an extension of stay can be granted. The ImmD does not maintain statistics on the employment situation of successful applicants under the above two schemes when they first arrived in Hong Kong, as well as other statistical breakdowns mentioned in the question.

(2) Since its establishment on October 30, 2023, Hong Kong Talent Engage (HKTE) has been providing comprehensive one-stop support to talent coming to / staying in Hong Kong under the various talent admission schemes (including theTTPS and theQMAS) through both online and offline means. Apart from providing comprehensive information on living and working in Hong Kong as well as handling enquiries from outside talent through its online platform (www.hkengage.gov.hk), HKTE organises with working partners a variety of online and offline activities such as job fairs, themed seminars, workshops (including Cantonese learning classes) and social integration activities (including Talent+ Volunteer Programme) to share information on entrepreneurship, employment as well as other living tips and to help the incoming talent to settle in Hong Kong and integrate into the city as soon as possible. The online platform is connected to about 90 designated working partners of HKTE to provide recommendations and services in areas such as job seeking, accommodation, education, integrated settlement, banking and insurance, business and corporate services as well as networking and community, through online matching tools.

 Earlier on, many internationally renowned sports professionals (such as Judd Trump, the world's number one snooker player, and Stephon Marbury, former National Basketball Association (NBA) player) have settled in Hong Kong. HKTE has invited them to participate in promotional activities to give first-hand sharing of their reasons for coming to Hong Kong, thereby promoting Hong Kong's unique strengths and development opportunities to attract more global talent with diverse backgrounds to pursue development in Hong Kong.

(3) Several internationally renowned snooker players have settled in Hong Kong, drawing public attention and interest for the sport. The Government will actively promote the development of local billiard sports, maintain connections with top snooker players pursuing development in Hong Kong, and provide appropriate support when needed to foster the development of billiard sports in Hong Kong together.

 The Government is committed to sports development through the five policy objectives of promoting sports in the community, supporting elite sports, maintaining Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events, enhancing professionalism, and developing sports as an industry. For the promotion of community sports, the Government organises various types of recreation and sports activities and encourages public participation to cultivate a strong sporting culture in the community, helping them develop a healthy lifestyle.

 The Government will continue to devote resources to expand the audience base of sports enthusiasts (including snooker fans) and support the organisation of major sports events through the ""M"" Mark System. The Major Sports Events Committee awarded the ""M"" Mark status to the World Snooker Grand Prix 2025 in March this year. It was the first time for the event to be held outside the United Kingdom. In addition to promoting the development of billiard sports in Hong Kong, the event also underlines Hong Kong's status as the centre for major international sports events.

(4) Hong Kong needs talent from various industries with diverse skills. It is difficult to provide financial incentives or tax benefits to all kinds of talent coming to Hong Kong for development under theQMAS or theTTPS. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is bestowed with unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of our motherland and being closely connected to the world. In addition, Hong Kong has a strong foundation for success, with institutional strengths such as a world-class business environment, a simple and low tax system, and a highly open and internationalised market. All these strengths make Hong Kong an ideal place for talent looking for personal growth and self-enhancement, as they can bring their innovative ideas to life and make positive changes to the world. Many professionals also choose to base in Hong Kong to explore development opportunities in Mainland China. Relevant bureaux and departments will continue to stay in close touch with industry stakeholders to understand the latest developments and manpower needs of the industries, and continuously improve the measures to trawl for talent, such as providing targeted support with a view to attracting outside talent engaged in specific industries."
立法會十八題：沙田車公廟的管理,2025-07-02 11:10,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200284.htm,"​以下是今日（七月二日）在立法會會議上李世榮議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見認為沙田車公廟（車公廟）作為重要歷史文化廟宇，具有深厚的歷史底蘊和廣泛的社會影響力。關於該廟的管理，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於根據華人廟宇委員會（委員會）的資料，車公廟截至去年三月三十一日止的年度盈餘超過1,600萬元，政府是否知悉，該盈餘所擬作的具體用途為何，包括會否撥入《華人廟宇條例》（第153章）下的華人慈善基金或用於沙田區的社區項目；

（二）是否知悉就車公廟相關的重大決策（例如擴建工程及廟內的服務收費調整等），委員會如何徵詢善信或文物保護團體的意見，以及有否定期舉行公開會議或備存諮詢紀錄；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）是否知悉委員會有否制定車公廟未來10年的發展戰略，包括應對遊客流量增長、提供數碼化服務（例如使用電子祈福平台）或推行環保措施（例如減少香燭污染）；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

華人廟宇委員會（委員會）是根據《華人廟宇條例》（第153章）（《條例》）成立的法定機構。現時共有約350間廟宇向委員會註冊或由委員會以不同方式管理。沙田車公廟（車公廟）是由委員會管理的其中一間直轄廟宇。

就李世榮議員的提問，現回覆如下：

根據《條例》的規定，委員會轄下所有直轄廟宇（包括車公廟）的收入須先撥入華人廟宇基金，而非由各直轄廟宇的司祝自行決定收入的用途。華人廟宇基金主要用於進行傳統儀式，以及廟宇建築物及其財產的維修等用途。舉例而言，委員會曾在相關資助計劃下撥款資助沙田鄉事委員會九約建醮委員會舉辦沙田鄉事委員會九約十年一屆乙巳年太平清醮，以及資助沙田鄉事委員會舉辦參拜車公活動等。華人廟宇基金的盈餘則可撥入同樣由委員會管理的華人慈善基金，供本港華人慈善活動用途，包括撥款予民政事務總署用作緊急援助金，以幫助受天災或意外影響的本港華人，以及設有華人慈善基金撥款資助計劃，資助本港的華人慈善活動及計劃。華人廟宇基金的盈餘用途也受《條例》規範，同樣也不是由各直轄廟宇的司祝決定。

委員會及其轄下的工作小組會就委員會轄下廟宇（包括車公廟）的運作及相關事宜提供建議。其中，委員會轄下設有工程小組，就委員會轄下廟宇工程的規劃、管理及相關事宜進行討論，並向委員會呈交建議。就廟宇維修工作等事宜而言，委員會會按需要諮詢相關持份者，例如若廟宇屬法定古蹟的話，委員會會諮詢古物古蹟辦事處的意見。委員會的會議不作公開，故相關文件也不會公開。

委員會一直密切留意與廟宇相關的整體發展，致力在各方面與時俱進，以符合到訪各直轄廟宇（包括車公廟）的善信及遊客的需要。舉例而言，委員會就其轄下的六間法定古蹟廟宇印製了法定古蹟廟宇神祇明信片，並在相關廟宇設置壓印，鼓勵善信或遊客到訪收集。委員會亦一直推動數碼化服務，例如近年在車公廟內設立數碼金榜題名顯示屏，並在近月維修及重髹車公廟車公神像期間，引入裸眼3D技術，展示車公元帥的影像。此外，在推行環保措施方面，委員會亦致力在其直轄廟宇引入環保設施，例如淨煙處理系統、環保化寳爐等。"
LCQ18: Management of Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin,2025-07-02 11:10,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200291.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Stanley Li and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (July 2):

Question:

There are views that the Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin, being an important historical and cultural temple, has a profound history and extensive social influence. Regarding the management of the temple, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that according to the information provided by the Chinese Temples Committee, the annual surplus of the Che Kung Temple for the year ended March 31 last year exceeded $16 million, whether the Government knows the intended specific uses of the surplus, including whether it will be transferred to the General Chinese Charities Fund under the Chinese Temples Ordinance (Cap. 153) or used for community projects in Sha Tin District;

(2) whether it knows, in respect of major decisions relating to the Che Kung Temple (e.g. the expansion project and the adjustment of fees for services provided in the temple), how the Committee seeks the views of worshippers or heritage conservation groups, and whether the Committee has held open meetings or kept records of such consultations on a regular basis; if the Committee has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it knows if the Committee has formulated development strategies for the Che Kung Temple for the next 10 years, including coping with the growth in visitor flow, providing digitalised services (e.g. using a platform for electronic blessings) or implementing environmental protection measures (e.g. reducing the pollution caused by joss sticks); if the Committee has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Chinese Temples Committee is a statutory body established in accordance with the Chinese Temples Ordinance (Cap. 153). At present, there are around 350 temples registered with the Committee or managed by the Committee through different means. The Che Kung Temple, Shatin, is one of the administered temples under the Committee.

I give the reply in response to the question raised by the Hon Stanley Li as follows:

According to the Ordinance, all revenues from the administered temples under the Committee (including the Che Kung Temple) must first be transferred to the Chinese Temples Fund (CTF). The temple keepers of individual administered temples do not have the authority to determine the use of these revenues. The CTF is primarily used for the purposes of organising customary ceremonies and the maintenance of the temple buildings and temple properties and so on. For instance, the Committee has granted fundings under relevant funding schemes to the Ta Chiu Festival Committee of Kau Yeuk of the Sha Tin Rural Committee for organising the decennial Ta Chiu Festival in the Year of Yisi, and to the Sha Tin Rural Committee for organising the Che Kung worshipping event. Any surpluses from the CTF may be transferred to the General Chinese Charities Fund (GCCF), also managed by the Committee, for the purposes of any Chinese charity in Hong Kong. It includes grants to the Home Affairs Department for provision of emergency financial relief to needy persons of Chinese race who are affected by natural disasters or accidents, as well as the GCCF funding scheme supporting charitable activities and projects for the Chinese community in Hong Kong. The use of surpluses from the CTF is also governed by the Ordinance and is not subject to the discretion of the temple keepers of individual administered temples.

The Committee and its working groups render advice on matters relating to the operations of its administered temples (including the Che Kung Temple). Specifically, the Works Working Group under the Committee discusses matters relating to the planning and management of its temples, and submit recommendations to the Committee. For temple maintenance and related matters, the Committee would consult relevant stakeholders as appropriate. For example, the Committee would seek advice from the Antiquities and Monuments Office on works for administered temples under the Committee that are declared monuments. The Committee's meetings are not open to the public, and related documents are therefore not disclosed to the public.

The Committee has all along been keeping abreast of the overall development of temple-related matters, striving to keep up with the times to meet the needs of worshippers and visitors of its administered temples (including the Che Kung Temple). For example, the Committee has made postcards for its six administered temples that are declared monuments and installed debossing stations at these temples for collection by worshippers and visitors. The Committee has also been actively promoting digital services, such as installing a digital wishing board display at the Che Kung Temple in recent years. Besides, during the recent maintenance and repainting of the Che Kung statue, the Committee has introduced naked-eye 3D technology to project images of Che Kung. Furthermore, in respect of environmental protection measures, the Committee is committed to implementing green facilities at its administered temples, including smoke filtration systems and eco-friendly joss paper burners and so on."
申訴專員三大策略性方向取得成果　為市民帶來實際裨益（附圖）,2025-07-02 11:00,2025-07-02 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200300.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出︰

申訴專員陳積志今日（七月二日）發表二○二四／二五年度申訴專員年報。在報告年度內，公署在處理查詢、申訴、重新評審和覆檢個案均全部超出服務指標完成。

陳積志說︰「我在去年四月一日履新後，為公署制定了三個策略性方向：（一）積極以調解方式有效和快速地處理市民的申訴；（二）促進跨部門及跨機構的協作，提供高效優質的公共服務；以及（三）在社會層面推動正面和積極的申訴文化。這三個策略性方向旨在提升公共行政質素，為市民帶來實際裨益，同時鼓勵政府和市民共同建設更穩定和諧、不斷進步的社會。」

在年度內，公署成功調解了555宗申訴，接近上年度的三倍，佔已跟進個案的33.5%，刷新了公署的紀錄。而以調解方式結案的申訴個案平均僅需時10.87天，顯著加快為市民紓困排憂。

在促進跨部門跨機構協作方面，在年度內，公署完成了三宗涉及跨部門及機構協作的主動調查行動及成功處理了141宗涉及跨部門及機構協作的個案。

公署全力宣揚「正面看申訴」這個理念，在年度內，除了每年的申訴專員嘉許獎計劃外，亦向16個部門和機構發出共41封嘉許信，以及向申訴人致送了19張感謝狀，以表揚他們對改善公共行政的貢獻。公署亦首次為大學、大專院校舉辦講座，全年為大學和中學舉辦了共13場「正面看申訴」講座。公署正積極籌備成立香港國際申訴專員學院，為政府部門及公營機構提供適切的培訓，提升公署員工的專業能力，並且促進公署與海外申訴機構的交流和合作。

公署在年度內完成了八項主動調查行動及40個全面調查個案，合共提出了254項改善公共行政的建議，較去年建議的總數增加了37%，建議全數獲相關政府部門或機構接納，部分建議亦已獲跟進及落實。由二○二四年十一月起，公署亦對以查訊方式完成處理的個案提出觀點，點出已實行的改善措施或可從速改善之處。截至二○二五年三月三十一日，公署提出了106項觀點均獲相關政府部門和公營機構接納。

公署在本年度接到4 402宗涉及不同課題的申訴個案，並完成處理了4 664宗（連同由上一年度轉入的個案），當中3 009宗經評審後結案，以及1 655宗已跟進並結案。

Ombudsman's three strategic focuses deliver results and tangible benefits to community (with photo),2025-07-02 11:00,2025-07-02 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200298.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

  The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (July 2) presented the 2024-25 Annual Report of The Ombudsman to the public. The Office exceeded all its service targets in handling enquiries, complaints, reassessment and review of complaints in the reporting year.

  Mr Chan said, ""Since assuming office on April 1 last year, I have championed three strategic focuses: (1) enhancing mediation to effectively and swiftly resolve public complaints; (2) fostering interdepartmental collaboration to provide highly efficient and quality public services; and (3) cultivating a positive and proactive complaint culture within the community. These three initiatives are designed to improve the quality of public administration, deliver tangible benefits to our citizens, and encourage the Government and citizens to foster a more stable, harmonious and progressive society for all.""

  In the reporting year, the Office concluded an all-time high of 555 cases by mediation, nearly tripling the number of the previous year and accounting for 33.5 per cent of the cases pursued. Given that the average time taken to resolve a complaint by way of mediation was only 10.87 days, it significantly expedited the process of redressing grievances for the public.

  On the front of fostering interdepartmental collaboration, the Office completed three direct investigation operations and processed 141 complaint cases during the year in this connection.

  The Office has stepped up efforts to cultivate a positive complaint culture. In addition to the annual Ombudsman's Awards Scheme, the Office issued 41 appreciation letters to 16 departments and organisations, and presented 19 appreciation certificates to complainants during the year, recognising their contribution to the enhancement of public administration. For the first time, the Office hosted seminars for universities and tertiary institutes, with a total of 13 seminars held at tertiary and secondary institutes throughout the year to promote a positive complaint culture. The Office is in active preparation for establishing the Hong Kong International Ombudsman Academy to provide appropriate training for government departments and public organisations, enhance the professional capabilities of staff of the Office, and promote exchanges and co-operation between the Office and overseas ombudsman institutions.

  The Office completed eight direct investigation operations and 40 full investigations during the year, delivering a total of 254 recommendations, 37 per cent more compared to that of the previous year, for improvement of public administration. All the recommendations were accepted by the government departments or organisations concerned, including some having been pursued and implemented. From November 2024 onwards, the Office started making observations in cases concluded after inquiries to highlight the improvements that had been or could be put in place more speedily. As at March 31, 2025, 106 observations had been made and were well received by the government departments or public organisations concerned.

  In the reporting year, the Office received 4 402 complaints on various topics and completed 4 664 cases (including some carried over from the preceding year), of which 3 009 were assessed and closed and 1 655 pursued and concluded.

​政務司司長出席立法會圖書館優化設施及服務啟用儀式致辭（只有中文）,2025-07-02 10:55,2025-07-02 11:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/02/P2025070200295.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（七月二日）出席立法會圖書館優化設施及服務啟用儀式的致辭：

尊敬的梁君彥主席（立法會主席）、各位議員、各位秘書處和政府的同事：

大家好。今天我很高興能參與立法會圖書館優化設施及服務的啟用儀式。

與我們平時熟悉的圖書館有些不同，立法會圖書館作為憲制圖書館，超過一半的館藏都與憲制及議會有關。自二○一二年立法會綜合大樓啟用以來，立法會圖書館一直為使用者提供不同資源，幫助他們了解立法會的職能、工作和歷史，以至內地和其他地方的憲制制度發展。

立法會一直精益求精，去年底通過一系列圖書館設施及服務的優化建議，打造一個現代化的圖書館。經優化的圖書館除了有舒適的閱讀區及很多政策藏書外，剛才主席亦有提到，亦增設了科技創意空間，配備3D打印機、航拍無人機及虛擬實境裝置，為訪客帶來嶄新的體驗，令圖書館也可以很有活力，經驗可以很不一樣。這些創新設施不但提升了圖書館的功能與吸引力，亦有助公眾更深入了解立法會的工作。

優化後的圖書館亦設有一個全新的專題展覽空間。剛才主席亦有提到，打響頭炮的展覽以「行政立法關係」為主題，回顧香港百多年來行政與立法關係的演變，我覺得非常有意義。

我們在國家的大力支持下，成功落實「愛國者治港」。無論是審議法案和撥款建議、或是為政策措施出謀獻策，現在的立法會議員都以理性、務實的方式議政，實事求是、分秒必爭。在香港邁向「由治及興」的新征程上，政府會繼續和立法會攜手合作，堅持互相尊重，持續良性互動，為市民謀幸福，為香港謀發展，這是我們最重要的目標。

最後，我要再次恭賀立法會順利完成優化圖書館的工程，期待我們更多的年輕人、一般市民，甚至是來自世界各個地方的遊客，都能親身來體驗香港特區立法會的好故事。謝謝大家。"

Delivering a speech at the dinner reception, the Director of the SHETO, Mrs Laura Aron, highlighted that the HKSAR Government has focused on economic development, achieving remarkable results. She encouraged citizens and enterprises in Shanghai and the East China region to continue leveraging Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore business opportunities, invest, and pursue employment or entrepreneurship in Hong Kong. She also expressed hope for continued robust co-operation between Shanghai and Hong Kong in areas such as trade, innovation, culture, and youth development, fostering mutual benefits.

Mrs Aron mentioned that next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the SHETO. She expressed gratitude to the Communist Party of China Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government for their support for the work of the HKSAR Government and the SHETO. The SHETO will continue to facilitate Shanghai-Hong Kong co-operation and support mutual success to make greater contributions to the country's high-quality development.

The Deputy Commissioner of Police (Management), Mr Chan Joon-sun, who is visiting Shanghai, attended the dinner. Speaking at the dinner reception, he shared that each anniversary occasion is an opportunity to review the development and achievements of ""one country, two systems"". With the introduction of the dual legislation on national security, Hong Kong has embarked on a new journey, advancing from chaos to order, and from stability to prosperity. It demonstrates the institutional advantages and strong vitality of ""one Country, two systems"". The country has been providing Hong Kong with opportunities to leverage its unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, promoting two-way exchanges between the mainland and the international community.

Hong Kong member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Shanghai and Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of New Frontier Group, Mr Carl Wu, also shared remarks at the dinner on Shanghai's support for Hong Kong-invested enterprises and the exchanges between Shanghai and Hong Kong.

The SHETO also invited emerging Hong Kong young artists to perform at the dinner reception, showcasing Hong Kong's diverse cultural charm through a suona performance blending Chinese and Western elements. Several Hong Kong students in Shanghai were also invited to showcase their talents.

The theme of the dinner reception was ""Multifaceted Hong Kong, Infinite Possibilities"", featuring interactive exhibition areas and photo check-in points themed around nine tourism development projects recently announced by the Working Group on Developing Tourist Hotspots, alongside the giant pandas gifted by the Central Government as design ideas, offering guests an immersive, multifaceted, and engaging experience of Hong Kong.

The SHETO, in collaboration with Invest Hong Kong, also organised a seminar entitled ""Hong Kong: Enabler of Mainland Catering and Food Enterprises to Go Global"" today. Insights on the competitive advantages and development opportunities of Hong Kong as a preferred place for business were shared with over 100 representatives from catering, food and other industrial sectors in the East China region. They were encouraged to set up business in and develop overseas markets through Hong Kong."

A male passenger, aged 37, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds inside his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (July 2).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
