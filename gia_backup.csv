The case involved an unauthorised structure on a common staircase on the ground floor of two composite buildings on Portland Street, Kowloon. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), removal orders were served on the concerned incorporated owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (August 28), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."
文化體育及旅遊局局長出席體育管治誠信聯盟啓動禮致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-28 10:33,2025-08-28 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/28/P2025082800279.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月二十八日）出席體育管治誠信聯盟啓動禮的致辭全文：

胡英明專員（廉政專員）、霍啟剛議員（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會副會長）、Mr Moray Taylor-Smith（香港賽馬會保安、誠信審查及資訊安全事務執行總監唐德誠）、Mr David Simmonds（香港公司治理公會會長司馬志）、各位體育界朋友、各位傳媒朋友：

大家早上好。今日我很高興可以出席由中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會（港協暨奧委會）、香港廉政公署、香港賽馬會及香港公司治理公會成立的體育管治誠信聯盟啓動禮。

體育管治誠信聯盟除了是一個加強溝通聯繫的平台外，最重要它會透過提供專業法律和會計服務支援、防貪諮詢、為體育總會的董事會成員及高級管理人員度身訂造體育治理專業資格課程等途徑，提升體育界的管治和誠信。這個目標與特區政府推動提升體育界的專業管治水平是完全一致。

我對於體育界，特別是體育總會的誠信和企業管治是有期望，亦有要求，因此我親身非常關注這方面的發展、具體工作方向和進度。

特區政府與港協暨奧委會在過去幾年積極推動進一步提升體育總會的機構管治水平。非常感謝港協暨奧委會努力地開展工作，在二○二○年十月已展開機構管治檢討工作，並於二○二四年十一月底公布了檢討報告及《機構管治守則》，要求其屬下體育總會於二○二六年底之前落實執行《守則》。自檢討報告及《守則》公布後，各個體育總會正積極執行各項建議，有些已初見成效。

體育總會是特區政府推行體育政策的重要合作夥伴之一。它們在負責推廣和發展有關體育項目，亦肩負培訓運動員和教練，以及選拔運動員代表香港參加國際性賽事的重任。體育總會對於提升香港的體育水平及增強香港體育界在國際的影響力和話語權擔當着重要的角色，而體育總會的管治是否具效率，主事人是否具備誠信，是直接影響總會表現、運動員士氣及成績，以及該項目能否蓬勃發展的主要因素。

近年，我們很開心看到香港運動員在國際體壇取得驕人成績，剛剛在成都舉行的世界運動會（世運會），香港隊的運動員就勇奪三金兩銀一銅的成績，打破中國香港隊過往參與世運會的記錄。運動員取得佳績，除了自己辛勤鍛鍊外，體育總會的支持亦非常重要。因此，體育總會實踐良好的機構管治對於推動香港體育進一步發展，並在國際比賽中爭取更好的成績，讓中國香港運動員在國際體壇的舞台上發光發亮絕對有密不可分的關係。

所以，我鼓勵各體育總會積極參與體育管治誠信聯盟的活動，好好利用這個專業平台，全面提升機構管治水平。我知道聯盟非常有效率，在今日的啓動禮後，香港廉政公署的同事會馬上和各體育總會進行體育總會誠信領導課程。我期待見到各體育總會在機構管治有快速的進步，大家同心協力，讓香港體育發展成一項為充滿活力的產業和推動發展的動力。

藉這個機會，我想感謝港協暨奧委會、（香港）廉政公署、（香港）賽馬會，以及香港公司治理公會。你們不單是各自領域的翹楚，更運用你們的專業協助體育界提升管治誠信，攜手推動新風氣，建立健全的管治制度、具誠信的文化，以及透明高效的處事標準，我希望這些都能夠紮根於香港的體育界。

我祝願體育管治誠信聯盟的工作能夠蒸蒸日上，今日的體育總會誠信領導課程成果豐碩，參與的朋友滿載而歸。

提一提，今日是十五運會（第十五屆全國運動會）第一日開始售票的日子，一息間在十時就可以透過線上購票，當然需要預先登記，未登記的可以先登記，或上網登記亦可。如果線下購票，中國旅行社有11間分行供大家線下購票。希望我們加強管治誠信之餘，也多多支持中國香港隊運動員，讓他們在全運會得享主場之利。

多謝大家。"

The first case involved a male passenger, aged 55, who arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found about 12kg of suspected cannabis buds in 24 vacuum-sealed plastic bags and one plastic bag inside his check-in suitcase. The estimated market value was about $2.7 million. The man was subsequently arrested.

The theme of the session was ""Building Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent"".

Since its establishment, the CETT has been closely engaging with different stakeholders across the community. It earlier met with the presidents of universities, representatives from the innovation and technology sector, etc. and attended the Ante Chamber Exchange Session of the Legislative Council to pool wisdom and ideas and enhance collaboration, with a view to further advancing the integrated development of education, technology and talent as well as the work of the CETT, and providing solid support for the reform and innovation of Hong Kong's development. The Panel of Advisors serves as a high-level exchange platform with members from various sectors of society, including community leaders and professionals from different fields. There will be a specific discussion theme for each engagement session to facilitate focused and in-depth exchanges.

At the engagement session today, the Panel of Advisors to the CETT engaged in in-depth discussions on the objective of building Hong Kong into an international hub for high-calibre talent. The Panel of Advisors affirmed the effectiveness of talent attraction measures of the current-term Government. Given external challenges, Hong Kong should more precisely target the positioning of the eight centres and timely refine the measures to further enhance the diversity of the talent pool and effectiveness of the talent attraction measures. The Government should also enhance training and use of local talent to strengthen the talent support for the future development of Hong Kong. The Panel of Advisors also agreed to intensify efforts to attract teaching and research talent to establish an international education hub, and to leverage the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone to provide more development opportunities for promising technology start-ups and talent.

The session also reviewed the latest situation regarding Hong Kong's overall population and labour force, the progress in talent attraction, and an overview of talent retention. In the face of an ageing population and pressure on labour supply, the Panel of Advisors supported the Government’s introduction of timely and appropriate measures in response to the challenges.

Mr Chan expressed gratitude for the members' acceptance of the appointments, and looked forward to working closely with the members to pool wisdom and ideas for comprehensively promoting the integrated development of education, technology and talent.

In April this year, the DPO and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Data signed a Memorandum of Understanding between Shanghai and Hong Kong on Digital Economy Co-operation (the MOU) to further deepen I&T co-operation and promote the joint development of the digital economy in both cities, thereby opening up deeper and broader collaboration prospects for the I&T industries between the two places.""

SEE attends APEC Energy Ministerial Meeting in Korea (with photos),2025-08-27 19:10,2025-08-27 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700559.htm,"The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Energy Ministerial Meeting (EMM) held in Busan, Korea, today (August 27). Under the theme ""Building a Sustainable Tomorrow"" for APEC this year, the meeting will focus discussions on topics under three priorities: ""Connect, Innovate, Prosper"".

 Speaking at the opening session, Mr Tse said, ""Under the 'one country, two-systems' principle, Hong Kong, China remains to be the freest economy of the world and the world's third most competitive international financial centre, and operates under the common law system. We will continue to serve as a platform and hub to connect the world to develop new energy solutions to diversify power resources to support the development of energy-hungry artificial intelligence and related industries. At the same time, we should not forget innovation to improve energy efficiency to make new technological developments sustainable.""

 APEC economies consume approximately 60 per cent of the world's energy. Mr Tse pointed out that with the concerted efforts of different sectors of the community, as of 2022, the aggregate energy intensity in Hong Kong, China has decreased by over 30 per cent, using 2005 as the base year.While the electricity consumption in the past 20 years has increased by 15 per cent, the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates due to power generation have been reduced by 98 per cent, 77 per cent and 86 per cent respectively. After Hong Kong reached its carbon peak in 2014, the carbon emissions have been reduced by about a quarter compared to the peak.

 The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government endeavours to cut the city's carbon emissions by half before 2035 compared to the 2005 level, and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. The HKSAR Government has set the target to phase out coal for daily electricity generation by 2035, and increase the share of zero carbon energy in the fuel mix for electricity generation to about 60 to 70 per cent by 2035.

 Mr Tse also shared that the HKSAR Government has been embracing AI to improve grid management and strengthen the resilience of power supply system. On green finance, the total green and sustainable debt issued in Hong Kong in 2024 exceeded US$84 billion, ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years. Furthermore, Hong Kong holds green mega events from time to time, such as the Hong Kong Green Week and Eco Expo Asia, to strengthen liaison and co-operation between different sectors.

 Mr Tse will join discussion sessions tomorrow (August 28) and have bilateral meetings with representatives from other APEC member economies."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-27 19:06,2025-08-27 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700707.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 27), one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

The new case involves a 34-year-old male living in Central and Western District. An initial investigation revealed that he travelled to Sri Lanka on August 15. During his stay, he was bitten by mosquitoes. While still in Sri Lanka, he developed a fever, headache and joint pain on August 19, followed by a rash on August 24. His fever subsided before he returned to Hong Kong on August 25. Due to persistent joint pain, he attended a private hospitalfor treatment yesterday (August 26). His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. Since the patient was afebrile before arriving in Hong Kong, he was no longer infectious to mosquitoes and did not require hospitalisation in Hong Kong. His household contact, who travelled to Sri Lanka with him, is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

Since the patient stayed in Sri Lanka during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing and it has reported the case to the health authority of Sri Lanka.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 12 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

""According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal. High temperatures and rainfall levels in summer continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world, members of the public must remain vigilant. As the new school year is about to begin, the CHP urged the schools to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. They should also remind the staff members and students to enact mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that they must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

ââ
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

 Good afternoon, Chair and fellow colleagues. Allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy of the Republic of Korea, for hosting the APEC Energy Minister Meeting and the warm hospitality extended to our delegation.

 Sustainability and prosperity are not mutually exclusive, and to do so, we need to collaborate and think outside the box. Hong Kong, China has positioned herself as a super connector. Under the ""one country, two-systems"" principle, Hong Kong, China remains to be the freest economy of the world, the world's third most competitive international financial centre, and operates under the common law system. We will continue to serve as a platform and hub to connect the world to develop new energy solutions to diversify power resources to support the development of energy-hungry AI and related industries. At the same time, we should not forget innovation to improve energy efficiency to make new technological developments sustainable.

 APEC economies consume approximately 60 per cent of the world's energy. APEC's Energy Intensity Reduction Goal is to reduce APEC's aggregate energy intensity by 45 per cent by 2035, against the 2005 level. Thanks to the concerted efforts of the community, as of 2022, the aggregate energy intensity in Hong Kong, China has decreased by over 30 per cent.

 While the electricity consumption in the past 20 years has increased by 15 per cent, the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates due to power generation have been reduced by 98 per cent, 77 per cent and 86 per cent respectively.

 Hong Kong, China reached its carbon peak in 2014. Compared to the peak, our carbon emissions have been reduced by about a quarter now. Our per capita carbon emissions in 2023 were about 4.4 tonnes. On this foundation, Hong Kong commits to strive to further cut our carbon emissions by half before 2035 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.

 On electricity generation, we will phase out coal for daily electricity generation by 2035, and increase the share of zero carbon energy from a quarter as of today to about 60 to 70 per cent by 2035. We are in good progress towards our target of reducing the electricity consumption in commercial buildings by 15 to 20 per cent, and 10 to 15 per cent for residential buildings by 2035. About 3.7 billion kWh of electricity has been conserved in 2024 compared to 2015.

 Hong Kong, China has been embracing artificial intelligence and Internet of Things to improve grid management, including the use of AI management system to monitor critical power facilities and to strengthen the resilience of power supply system.

 On green finance, in 2024, the total green and sustainable debt issued in Hong Kong, China exceeded US$84 billion, making Hong Kong, China the top green financing centre in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018.

 Hong Kong, China is also home to green mega events. We will be launching our second Hong Kong Green Week on September 8, followed by the 20th Eco Expo Asia in end-October, where government officials and industry leaders gather to share, collaborate and innovate. Allow me to close my remarks by extending my warmest invitation to you all to participate in the upcoming events in September and October in Hong Kong, China. Thank you."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-27 18:30,2025-08-27 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700687.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十七日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於中西區的34歲男子。初步調查顯示，他於八月十五日到斯里蘭卡，在當地逗留期間曾被蚊叮咬，並於八月十九日起在斯里蘭卡出現發燒、頭痛及關節痛，八月二十四日起出現皮疹。他在八月二十五日回港前已經退燒，但因關節持續疼痛，昨日（八月二十六日）到私家醫院求診。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。由於病人抵港前已經退燒，抵港後對蚊子不具傳染性，因此無需入院。一名早前與他一同到斯里蘭卡的家居接觸者現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處斯里蘭卡，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報斯里蘭卡衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得12宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至今年七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案，當中約90宗為死亡個案。夏季溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港，以至全球爆發的風險持續，市民不能掉以輕心。由於新學年即將開始，中心呼籲學校按照食物環境衞生署（食環署）的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，務必提醒教職員及學生，應時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。」

繼續加強防控

食環署繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

​為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成10種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，無論在本地或是外遊期間都必須時刻採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。若出現相關病徵，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後，應立即求醫，並通知醫生相關旅遊史。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
​運輸及物流局局長與東莞市市長會面（附圖）,2025-08-27 18:15,2025-08-27 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700526.htm,"運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（八月二十七日）與東莞市市長呂成蹊會面，就加強香港和東莞在運輸物流合作等議題交流討論，運輸及物流局常任秘書長蔡傑銘和香港機場管理局（機管局）行政總裁張李佳蕙亦有出席。

陳美寶表示，香港與東莞地緣相近、人緣相親，在運輸物流方面更是合作無間。機管局與東莞一同促進兩地的「海空貨物聯運」創新發展，香港國際機場東莞空港中心正是粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）城市優勢互補的一大舉措。空港中心第一期永久設施的首階段建設預計今年內完成，而整個第一期發展目標於二○二七年全面投入營運。機管局亦即將開展第二期發展的前期研究工作，讓香港國際機場為大灣區以至國家的貨運進出口需求及跨境電商發展提供穩固支撐。

 她續指，香港是大灣區貨物出入口的門戶，運輸及物流局高度重視與大灣區合作，從多方面推動「加強大灣區合作、把握發展新機遇」的物流發展策略，透過加強與大灣區的物流協同發展和發展多式聯運，同時研究擴展航空轉運貨物豁免許可證安排，以積極融入國家發展大局，助力大灣區貨物互聯互通。今年底完成構建的港口社區系統亦會聯通本地、內地及海外港口和全球航運商業數據平台，提供一站式全天候貨物實時追蹤及聯通海、陸、空運輸資訊，以及「一單多報」等增值電子服務功能，以加強與內地及海外各港口的協作。

陳美寶說：「東莞是世界知名的製造業基地，香港則是國際航空中心及物流樞紐，港莞合作正是強強聯手的最佳例證。香港會繼續發揮內聯外通的優勢，擔當國家與世界各地間的超級聯繫人角色，透過香港的運輸物流網絡，並加強發展海空聯運和『水水中轉』等業務，為大灣區和世界各地之間建立更無縫的物流通道。」"
STL meets Mayor of Dongguan Municipal Government (with photos),2025-08-27 18:15,2025-08-27 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700529.htm,"The Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, met the Mayor of the Dongguan Municipal Government, Mr Lyu Chengxi, today (August 27) to exchange views on strengthening co-operation between Hong Kong and Dongguan in transport and logistics and other areas. Also attending the meeting were the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Kevin Choi, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), Mrs Vivian Cheung.

Ms Chan said that with close geographical and cultural ties, Hong Kong and Dongguan have been working together seamlessly in transport and logistics. The AAHK and Dongguan have been jointly promoting the innovative development of sea-air intermodal cargo transshipments between the two places, with the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) Dongguan Logistics Park being one of the key initiatives to leverage the complementary advantages of the cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The first-phase construction of the logistics park permanent facility is expected to be completed this year, with the entire Phase 1 development targeted for full operation by 2027. The AAHK will commence the preliminary study of the Phase 2 development shortly, enabling HKIA to provide solid support for import and export cargo demand as well as the development of cross-border e-commerce in the GBA and across the country.
â
She added that Hong Kong serves as the GBA's gateway for the import and export of goods. The Transport and Logistics Bureau attaches great importance to co-operation with the GBA and promotes the logistics development strategy of ""strengthening collaboration with the GBA and grasping new development opportunities"" on various fronts. By deepening synergistic logistics development with the GBA and advancing intermodal transport, as well as exploring the feasibility of extending the arrangements under the Air Transhipment Cargo Exemption Scheme, Hong Kong is proactively integrating into the national development and facilitating the interconnection of cargo flows in the GBA. The Port Community System, to be completed by the end of this year, will connect with local, Mainland and overseas ports and global shipping business data platforms. The system provides round-the-clock, real-time cargo tracking, integrating sea, land, and air transport data, and offering value-added electronic services such as the ""One-Data-Multiple-Declarations"" function, thereby enhancing collaboration among ports on the Mainland and overseas.

  Ms Chan said, ""Dongguan is a world-renowned manufacturing base, while Hong Kong is an international aviation centre and logistics hub. The co-operation between the two cities is the best example of fostering a strong alliance. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its advantage of having extensive connections to both the Mainland and the world, and its role as a 'super connector', establishing more seamless logistics channels while strengthening the development of the sea-air transshipment and 'water-to-water transshipment' businessbetween the GBA and the world through Hong Kong's transport and logistics network."""
商務及經濟發展局局長出席第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」記者會開場發言（只有中文）,2025-08-27 17:16,2025-08-27 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700561.htm,"以下是商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（八月二十七日）出席第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」記者會的開場發言：

各位傳媒朋友，大家好。特區政府與香港貿易發展局（貿發局）舉辦的「一帶一路高峰論壇」今年已經是第十屆，在介紹今屆論壇的亮點之前，我希望藉這個機會，與大家回顧特區政府在推動共建「一帶一路」所作出的努力和貢獻。

國家在二○一三年提出「一帶一路」倡議，並強調「共建『一帶一路』源自中國，成果和機遇屬於世界」。經過多年共同努力，共建「一帶一路」已由倡議變成實踐，從理念轉化為行動，從願景轉變為現實。特區政府在共建「一帶一路」中的貢獻也是多方面的，我們積極參與八項行動。香港作為國際貿易和金融中心，一直以來對外都非常開放；「一帶一路」倡議讓香港發揮在聯通方面的顯著優勢，為香港帶來持續機遇，充當「一帶一路」首選功能平台和重要節點，促進共建「一帶一路」的發展。

自二○一三年以來，香港與「一帶一路」國家及地區的商品貿易額大幅增長近八成，為同期香港對外商品貿易額增幅的3.2倍，達到約2,800億美元。此外，二○二三年，香港對這些地區的對外直接投資頭寸超過1,300億美元，是二○一三年的3.6倍，更是香港總體增幅的四倍。這些數字不僅展示香港作為國際貿易和投資樞紐的強大實力，也突顯「一帶一路」市場的增長潛力。

香港至今已與包括14個「一帶一路」國家簽訂自由貿易協定，以及與包括約20個「一帶一路」國家簽訂促進和保護投資協定，支持建設開放型世界經濟。特區政府亦透過「發展品牌、升級轉型及拓展內銷市場的專項基金」資助中小企參與出口推廣活動，以及發展品牌、升級轉型和拓展營銷。政府的經濟貿易辦事處、貿發局和投資推廣署的海外網絡至今覆蓋99個「一帶一路」國家。香港也不時檢視政策及措施，提振香港與包括「一帶一路」國家在內的國際貿易。例如，去年《施政報告》宣布調低烈酒稅，來自各地包括「一帶一路」國家的烈酒得以更低門檻進入香港市場。

香港的專業服務業全面並與國際標準接軌，包括法律、會計、建造、工程、設計、金融、綠色發展和創新科技等領域，為「一帶一路」項目提供全方位的支持。香港作為全球領先的金融中心，也為「一帶一路」提供專業的投融資、風險管理、保險和財富管理等服務。香港的綠色發展方面，可以在綠色評估、認證、金融等方面賦能「一帶一路」國家。在科技創新方面，二○二四年在香港設立的初創企業數目近5 000家，創新高。香港擁有內聯外通的獨特優勢，不少內地科技企業借助香港平台「走出去」，推動共建「一帶一路」科技創新。

在人文交往方面，我們通過舉辦各類文化交流和教育合作項目，增進與「一帶一路」國家的理解與友誼，為長期合作奠定基礎。「一帶一路獎學金」自二○一六／一七學年起推出，而去年《施政報告》亦提出打造「留學香港」品牌，吸引「一帶一路」沿線國家和地區的傑出學生到港升學。香港的「亞藝無疆」藝術節亦已成為每年盛事，吸引眾多市民和旅客參與，展示亞洲及「一帶一路」國家和地區的文化魅力。另外，特區政府推動業界參與清真認證，截至今年六月中已有190間餐廳獲得認證，而香港在非伊斯蘭合作組織的穆斯林友善旅遊目的地排名，由去年的全球第四名攀升至今年的第三名。

至於特區政府與貿發局合作的「一帶一路高峰論壇」，更加是香港參與「一帶一路」重要的一環，並列入《共建「一帶一路」：構建人類命運共同體的重大實踐》白皮書所介紹共建「一帶一路」十年來取得的成果之一。由首屆論壇有來自48個國家和地區超過2 400名與會者，發展到去年第九屆有約80個國家和地區超過6 000名與會者，論壇在「一帶一路」及其他地區的關注度有很大的提升。現屆政府在「一帶一路高峰論壇」至今共促成約50份合作備忘錄，範疇涵蓋商貿、金融、環保、氣象、反貪等。今屆我們促成的合作備忘錄預計比去年更多。

今年，「一帶一路高峰論壇」亦會有不少新亮點。例如，我們會新設「一帶一路」重點項目環節，促進香港專業服務和企業參與「一帶一路」重點基建項目；設立焦點市場環節，聚焦個別市場的潛在機遇；另會開設一個可持續發展的圓桌環節，向「一帶一路」國家官員分享專業服務和公共治理經驗；同時亦會加強與青年商業領袖的環節，增加交流。接下來，「一帶一路」專員及貿發局副總裁將介紹相關具體內容。

一如既往，中央部委會派員出席論壇。到目前為止已回覆出席的外國官員講者包括哈薩克斯坦及柬埔寨的副總理，馬來西亞、土耳其、巴基斯坦、斯里蘭卡和埃塞俄比亞的部長級官員；以及一些國際組織，例如亞太經濟合作組織的高層。論壇嘉賓的多元性，充分說明其他地方對論壇的肯定及對香港作為國際樞紐的認可。

今年論壇的主題為「合作求變‧共建未來」。我們相信藉第十屆論壇，將進一步提升香港在推動共建「一帶一路」發揮的作用，以及協助香港各界加深對「一帶一路」倡議的認識和切實把握其中的機會。特區政府將繼續深化與「一帶一路」國家的合作，實現互利共贏。謝謝大家。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 26 to noon today (August 27), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 269 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

 ",2025-08-27 15:33,2025-08-27 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/27/P2025082700265.htm,"Hong Kong Customs conducted a joint anti-illicit cigarette publicity campaign with members of the Tsuen Wan District Council, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health, the Housing Department (HD)and the Community Care Teamat Lei Muk Shue Estate in Tsuen Wan today (August 27).

During the event, in addition to patrolling the housing estates, Customs officers also promoted the Government's proposal to amend the existing legislation to increase penalties for illicit cigarette-related offences to security personnel, residents and traders, as well as encouraged them to report suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs.

If public rental housing units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the HD for follow-up action after the conclusion of court proceedings. Customs reminds members of the public, especially young people, not to buy or sell illicit cigarettes or distribute illicit cigarette leaflets to avoid creating a criminal record that could affect their future.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement to vigorously combat illicit cigarette activities through risk assessment, intelligence analysis and interception at source. Also, Customs will strengthen publicity and education to remind the public not to take part in unlawful acts related to illicit cigarettes.

Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years. Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002).

In accordance with the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person shall distribute any smoking product advertisement (including any promotional leaflets). Any person who contravenes the regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000. Members of the public may report any suspected activities of illicit cigarette leaflet distribution to TACO's hotline 2961 8823."

All prosecutorial decisions made by the DoJ are based on the law, the evidence and the Prosecution Code. Prosecutors do not consider, and would not be influenced by, irrelevant considerations such as political or individual interests, possible media or public reaction and personal feelings or beliefs of the prosecutors.

In the Director's Overview, the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ms Maggie Yang, stressed that the cardinal principle of prosecutorial independence as enshrined in Article 63 of the Basic Law continues to be the cornerstone of the operations to enable the DoJ to control criminal prosecutions free from any interference. She also stated that the Prosecutions Division's continued commitment to maintaining transparency and accountability reinforces public trust in the integrity and efficiency of the city's criminal justice system.

This latest review sets out the important achievements made by the Prosecutions Division in 2024, which include hosting the 11th Asia and Pacific Regional Conference of the International Association of Prosecutors in November last year. The event underscored Hong Kong's unwavering commitment to international collaboration and its constant pursuit of the highest standards of prosecutorial excellence. It was also a testament to the fact that Hong Kong maintains a robust legal system under the ""one country, two systems"" principle while enjoying staunch support from the motherland. The publication also gives a detailed account of the key cases handled by each subdivision of the Prosecutions Division."

律政司的所有檢控決定均是按法律、證據和《檢控守則》作出。檢控人員不會考慮亦不會受任何不相關的因素影響，例如政治或個人利益、媒體或公眾對決定可能產生的反應，以及檢控人員的個人感受或信念。

刑事檢控專員楊美琪在年報的序言中強調《基本法》第六十三條確立的檢控獨立這項基本原則是運作的基石，讓律政司主管刑事檢察工作，不受任何干涉。她亦表示刑事檢控科會繼續致力保持工作透明度及問責性，鞏固市民對本港刑事司法制度廉潔高效的信心。

這份最新的年報敍述刑事檢控科在二○二四年所取得的重要成果，包括在去年十一月主辦第11屆國際檢察官聯合會亞洲及太平洋地區會議。是次會議凸顯香港一直致力推動國際合作，不斷追求最高的檢控水平，力臻卓越，同時印證香港在「一國兩制」原則下維持穩健的法律制度，並獲得祖國的堅實支持。年報亦詳述刑事檢控科各個分科處理的重要案件。"

Through risk assessment, Customs on that day intercepted an incoming lorry at the HZMB Hong Kong Port. After inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected counterfeit mobile phones inside the cargo compartment of the lorry. A 56-year-old male driver was subsequently arrested.

An initial investigation revealed that the batch of suspected counterfeit mobile phones would have been transhipped to overseas regions.

The investigation is ongoing and the arrested man has been released on bail pending further investigation.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action against counterfeit goods and smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who imports or exports any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."
