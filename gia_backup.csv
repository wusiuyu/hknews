FS's keynote speech at Women Chief Executives Summit 2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-11-03 11:24,2025-11-03 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300325.htm,"  Following is the keynote speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Women Chief Executives Summit 2025 today (November 3):

Bonnie (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), Ms Bonnie Chan), Mary (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong and Greater China & North Asia, Standard Chartered, Ms Mary Huen), Amy (Co-Head of Wealth Management Asia Pacific, Head and Chief Executive of UBS Hong Kong, Ms Amy Lo), distinguished women chief executives from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a true privilege to join you at the inaugural Women Chief Executives Summit, right here in Hong Kong.

  A very warm welcome to each of you - nearly 200 C-suite leaders from across the globe. Your presence here speaks volumes about the growing leadership of women in business.

  This first Summit arrives at the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration - a bold, visionary agenda for advancing women's empowerment. Three decades later, it continues to challenge us to ask: How far have we come? And what kind of future are we building?

  The theme of this Summit is a powerful and timely response, as we work together to build a future with greater inclusivity, driven by innovation and defined by impact.

Inclusivity

  No doubt, inclusivity is the bedrock of lasting progress.

  It is my firm belief that inclusivity is best manifested when people are judged by meritocracy, by their values, by content of their character, regardless of gender, race or background.

  The journey of women in Hong Kong has been one of accelerating achievement. Women now make up more than half of our population and are transforming every arena of society.

  As highlighted in the recent KPMG report in collaboration with WCE and the Women's Foundation, Hong Kong is making great strides in expanding gender leadership in finance. Since 2018, we've seen double-digit growth in female representation both in senior leadership roles and on corporate boards.

  And I'm also pleased to note that according to the report, Hong Kong ranks top for societal acceptance of female leaders, and some 70 per cent of women feel encouraged to lead. And we are doing well in safety as well as in infrastructure for enabling work-life balance, too.

  Now, more than half of our solicitors and professional accountants are women - a leap from just 30 per cent two decades ago.

  On our campuses, nearly 60 per cent of students majoring in business and management are women. These are not just statistics - they are the future market-makers, fintech innovators, and next-generation CEOs.

  Yet, the progress may be uneven. As your report shows, some industries are moving faster than others. I believe that the key to further improvement lies in providing equal opportunities and ample exposure for both men and women, allowing their potential to be fully unleashed and abilities properly recognised and appreciated.

  That is the direction that the Government is taking.

  Our ""She Inspires"" Mentorship Programme, launched earlier this year, is a good example. It aims at cultivating the next generation of women leaders. I am pleased to share that we have already matched over 80 aspiring female university students with some 50 of Hong Kong's most accomplished women leaders.

  I see many of the mentors here today - thank you for sharing your time, experience and wisdom so generously. You are shaping the leaders of tomorrow.

  And we are just getting started. As announced in the recent Policy Address, the programme will be expanded by 50 per cent next year, bringing the next cohort to 120 mentees. 

  But let us be clear: true inclusivity cannot be achieved by government alone. It demands a whole-of-society commitment.

  I'm encouraged by the progress we're seeing. A notable example is the HKEX's mandate to phase out single-gender boards. Today, nearly all listed companies in Hong Kong have at least one female board member.

  But this should not be a matter of checking boxes. It must be a recognition that diversity is strength, instrumental to sound governance, innovation and resilience.

Resilience and creativity

  This brings us exactly to the second point - the value that women can add to an organisation.

  The point I try to make is not to stereotype men or women. They both bring a wealth of perspectives that are shaped by their respective social, cultural and professional backgrounds and experiences. It is the combination of such perspectives and experiences that will give organisations a more complete approach to problem-solving, enabling better management and performance.

  Research consistently shows that organisations with diverse leadership, including women at the helm, are more agile, more empathetic, more creative and better equipped to achieve long-term success.

  Each of you in this room is living proof. I'm sure in the ensuing discussions many of you will be able to tell how gender-diverse leadership makes a real impact.

Closing: Lighting the way forward

  Ladies and gentlemen, as we gather here, I cannot better conclude than with a quote by Sheryl Sandberg, former COO of Facebook: ""In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.""

  On that note, I wish this Summit every success, and for all of you, the best of health and business. And by the way, please do mark your diary for December 7, LegCo Election. Thank you very much."
Speech by CE at Hong Kong Fintech Week x StartmeupHK Festival (English only) (with photos),2025-11-03 11:07,2025-11-03 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110300290.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Hong Kong Fintech Week x StartmeupHK Festival today (November 3):

Honourable Deputy Governor Lu Lei (Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr Lu Lei), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. A warm welcome to this year's Hong Kong FinTech Week and StartmeupHK Festival, running concurrently for the very first time - as we enter a new era of innovation.

  This strategic alliance, on the 10th anniversary of both flagship events, creates an unparalleled opportunity to amplify innovation, technology and global collaboration on an unprecedented scale.

  Your presence this week is equally unprecedented. This year's event is the largest fintech gathering in Hong Kong's history, bringing together more than 37 000 executives, 800 speakers and 700 exhibitors from over 100 economies. Networking never looked so good.

  Hong Kong is made for collaboration. Built for innovation, for companies, entrepreneurs, investors and professionals like you - each and every one of you here today and throughout this eventful week.

  Our unique positioning is well recognised by the world. In September, Hong Kong placed third, overall, and tops in Asia, in the Global Financial Centres Index. The Index also named Hong Kong's fintech hub number one, globally.

  Not surprising, given that Hong Kong is now home to more than 1 200 fintech companies, up 10 per cent from last year. Given, too, that our fintech sector is expected to exceed US$600 billion in total revenue by 2032, with a cheering growth rate exceeding 28 per cent a year.

  More good news. In September, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster finished first in the World Intellectual Property Organisation's top 100 innovation clusters - after placing second, overall, the previous five years.

  It helps, too, that we continue to attract talented professionals. Indeed, Hong Kong placed fourth, globally, and first in Asia, in the World Talent Ranking. That's up from ninth last year, and 16th the year before. And, let me add, Hong Kong finished number one in Asia, and world's best in the percentage of science graduates.

  In this year’s World Investment Report, released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, our city moved up to third place, overall, in foreign direct investment inflows.

  And, as you know, it’s been a banner year for initial public offerings (IPO) here in Hong Kong. In the first nine months of the year, IPO fundraising had surpassed US$23 billion, underlining and bold-facing Hong Kong's revitalised status, as the world's premier listing and capital-raising venue.

  These and other international kudos reflect Hong Kong's status as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"". We help to link the markets from China, our country, with those around the globe. We help start-ups go from local prototypes to global success.

  Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong draws opportunities from both our country and the world. This dual advantage drives our connectivity and development.

  From January 2023 to September 2025, Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), our dedicated investment promotion agency, has helped more than 1 400 overseas and Mainland companies establish or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. They have brought in more than US$24 billion in foreign direct investment, creating some 20 000 jobs within the first year of their operation or expansion.

  This week, we are welcoming more than 30 Mainland and international delegations here for Fintech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival. Tomorrow, the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit returns, bringing together some 300 global financial leaders, including over 100 group chairmen or CEOs.

  Hong Kong's role in connecting Mainland and international markets has never been clearer.

  In my recent Policy Address, delivered in September, I introduced a series of initiatives to drive growth and strengthen Hong Kong's competitiveness.

  To cement our status as an international financial centre, we will deepen the equity market and expand world-class bond currency markets, while advancing the insurance and asset and wealth management sectors.

  In equities, we will support technology companies from the Mainland in fundraising, encourage overseas enterprises to pursue secondary listings here, and welcome the return of China Concept Stock companies from overseas markets, with Hong Kong as their preferred destination.

  We are committed to enhancing bond market infrastructure, establishing connections with overseas markets such as Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

  Hong Kong is proud to be the world's largest offshore Renminbi hub. We will continue to support its growing use in our economy. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will make use of the Currency Swap Agreement with the People's Bank of China to give companies longer-term Renminbi financing for trade, operations and capital expenditure.

  To strengthen asset and wealth management, we will enhance preferential tax regimes for funds, single-family offices and carried interest. The Capital Investment Entrant Scheme will also be relaxed to encourage more investors.

  In fintech, our Monetary Authority's Project Ensemble is exploring tokenisation in conventional finance, while applying the supervisory sandbox to boost innovation under prudent risk management.

  We are also accelerating the transformation of innovation and technology, focusing on key sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI), life and health sciences, new energy and aerospace.

  From building AI research clusters and enabling cross-boundary clinical trials to advancing hydrogen infrastructure, our goal is to help emerging industries scale and thrive.

  At the same time, we are strengthening collaboration with the Mainland to build a green and sustainable finance market supporting long-term development.

  We are committed to contributing to national development while deepening international exchanges and co-operation.

  The GoGlobal Task Force, announced in my latest Policy Address, was launched last month. It is designed to help Mainland businesses expand overseas using Hong Kong as their springboard. Working with InvestHK, our Economic and Trade Offices, the Trade Development Council and other governmental agencies, GoGlobal will smooth the way for Mainland companies to find foreign markets and global capital. Plenty of opportunities there for all concerned.

  In short, ladies and gentlemen, the future is bright for Hong Kong and the companies, investors and talent that work with Hong Kong.

  This year's anniversary editions of Hong Kong FinTech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival will give you a jump-start on the promising future of co-operation. This flagship event, very much like Hong Kong, connects you with a world of promising opportunities, together with the latest insights, intelligence and innovative technology.

  The main conference, today and tomorrow, features 11 targeted forums ranging from health and Insurtech to digital finance and assets, blockchain, AI, a China-Global Innovation Forum and more. And the international exhibition area spotlights finance, fintech and other advanced technology.

  I am grateful to the organisers - the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, and Invest HK, among others - together with our many supporters, for staging this vital global gathering over the past 10 years. A decade of success.

  And while you're here, with us, I urge you to invest some time exploring Hong Kong, the world's rising East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange - and good times.

  I wish you all a rewarding week and the best of fintech, start-ups and investment in the coming year.

  Thank you."

財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇說：「行政長官在今年的《施政報告》中提出會積極爭取亞投行在港設立辦公室。現在迎來亞投行決定在港設立辦事處的好消息，我們都感到非常欣喜，會積極配合亞投行的需要，為設立該辦事處提供所需支援。作為亞投行成員，中國香港一直致力協助亞投行充分利用本港蓬勃的資本市場、世界級的專業服務和多元化的金融產品，以支持該行在項目融資、發債、投資及財務管理等方面的運作。中國香港會繼續發揮『一國兩制』下內聯外通的獨特優勢，為亞投行長遠發展作出積極貢獻。」

​申訴專員公署公布政府就單車租賃店鋪違泊問題的規管機制的全面調查報告（附圖）,2025-11-03 11:00,2025-11-03 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025103100791.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出︰

申訴專員陳積志今日（十一月三日）宣布公署完成政府就單車租賃店鋪違泊單車問題的規管機制的全面調查。

政府就處理違例停泊單車的問題，相關地區的處理違例停泊單車工作小組內各部門包括民政事務總署（民政總署）轄下的分區民政事務處（民政處）、地政總署轄下的分區地政處（地政處）、食物環境衞生署（食環署）及運輸署，會因應單車的停泊位置及情況，根據法例賦予的權力和既定程序，適時採取跨部門聯合行動，清理在政府土地上違泊的單車。如接獲有關單車違泊的投訴，地政處、食環署及運輸署會轉介民政處根據工作小組有關清理違例停泊單車的聯合行動指引處理，由當區民政處統籌工作小組進行聯合行動。

陳積志表示：「公署留意到，沙田區有單車租賃店鋪長期把大量單車放置在店鋪外的行人通道（事涉地點），對行人構成阻礙甚至潛在安全隱患。申訴人自二○二四年五月向民政總署投訴，要求該署聯同相關政府部門採取跟進行動。然而，申訴人指問題並無改善，並認為各部門沒有妥善處理單車租賃店鋪的違泊情況。」

「公署調查發現，工作小組確實已就這宗申訴的事涉地點制訂行動指引，處理單車違泊的問題，而各部門亦已按行動指引的規定，根據法例賦予的權力和既定程序採取聯合行動。就申訴人的投訴，由二○二四年七月至二○二五年六月，工作小組進行了六次聯合行動，在現場張貼總共近千張法定通知及清理違泊單車。在公署展開查訊後，工作小組更特別增加於事涉地點進行聯合行動的頻次，自二○二五年六月起，由平均每兩個月一次增加至每月一次。工作小組亦有制訂違泊黑點，針對違泊嚴重的地點增加聯合行動。民政處更進一步由二○二五年八月起，陸續在當區的違泊黑點安裝告示牌，提醒商戶及有關人士自律及加強守法意識，不要違規停泊單車。」

「然而，公署調查發現，在工作小組採取聯合行動前和行動後，事涉地點仍然放置逾百輛單車，顯示該處的單車違泊情況確實持續嚴重。有關問題只是在相關部門執法期間得到短暫改善，不久違泊問題便故態復萌。」

「公署認為在香港各處單車違泊問題並未徹底解決，各部門應更進一步全面實踐和落實跨部門協作的精神，以認真和真正解決單車違泊問題為共同目標。就單車違泊情況，公署對工作小組提出了17項改善建議。工作小組接受並會落實公署的所有建議。

公署提出的主要改善建議包括：

• 繼續進行跨部門協作，緊密監察單車違泊情況；

• 在事涉違泊地點持續執行每月至少一次的大規模聯合行動；

• 考慮由以往每半年加強至每季甚至每月在聯合行動後檢討成效，並在有需要時適當地調整執法策略；

• 在日常巡查中，如發現有嚴重阻礙行人通道或對行人構成危險的情況，考慮即時或至少優先清理違泊的單車；

• 研究引入創新科技智能監察系統，試驗在事涉地點安裝智能鏡頭，利用人工智能辨識違規停泊單車，提升執法成效；

• 考慮在事涉地點附近增加或擴闊現有的單車泊車處，便利有需要的巿民和店鋪使用；

• 參考汽車停車場的管理，研究在單車泊車處採用雙層泊架的可行性；以及

• 加強與當區商戶的溝通及諮詢，亦要聽取營運者的意見，研究就違泊情況制訂具體及有效的改善方案。

全面調查報告已上載至申訴專員公署網頁www.ombudsman.hk供公眾參閱。"
Ombudsman announces results of full investigation into mechanism regulating illegal bicycle parking caused by bicycle rental shops (with photos),2025-11-03 11:00,2025-11-03 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025103100796.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (November 3) announced the completion of a full investigation into the mechanism regulating illegal bicycle parking caused by bicycle rental shops.

The Government addresses the problem of illegal bicycle parking by having member departments of the local Working Group on Tackling Illegal Bicycle Parking, which includes the District Office (DO) of the Home Affairs Department (HAD), the District Lands Office (DLO) of the Lands Department, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and the Transport Department (TD), exercise their respective powers under the law, depending on the location and condition of the bicycles, to conduct interdepartmental joint operations as necessary to remove bicycles illegally parked on government land in accordance with established procedures. Upon receiving complaints about illegal bicycle parking, the DLO, the FEHD, and the TD refer them to the DO for follow-up in accordance with the Working Group's guidelines on joint operations for clearing illegally parked bicycles (Operation Guidelines). Joint operations are carried out by the Working Group under the co-ordination of the relevant DO.

Mr Chan said, ""The Office of The Ombudsman notes that some bicycle rental shops in Shatin persistently placed a large number of bicycles along the pedestrian walkways outside the shops (the Location), obstructing pedestrians and even posing safety concerns. The complainant notified HAD in May 2024, requesting that it take follow-up action in collaboration with other relevant departments, but the departments failed to properly address the illegal bicycle parking caused by the rental shops such that the problem persisted.

""The Office's investigation found that the Working Group had indeed established Operation Guidelines to address illegal bicycle parking, and its member departments had also exercised their powers under the law to conduct joint operations in accordance with these guidelines and established procedures. In response to the complaint, the Working Group carried out six joint operations between July 2024 and June 2025, during which nearly 1 000 statutory notices were posted and illegally parked bicycles were cleared. Following our inquiry, the Working Group specifically increased the frequency of joint operations at the Location from an average of once every two months to once a month, starting in June 2025. As a further step in addressing the problem, the Working Group identified and compiled a list of blackspots, and intensified joint operations at severely affected locations. Since August 2025, the DO has been installing signage at the blackspots within the District to remind shop operators and related parties to exercise self-discipline, raise law-abiding awareness, and comply with bicycle parking regulations.

""However, our investigation revealed that both before and after the joint operation, over 100 bicycles remained parked at the Location, indicating the persistent severity of illegal bicycle parking there. The improvement was short-lived during the enforcement period by the relevant departments, with the problem of illegal parking soon recurring,"" said Mr Chan.

""The Office considers the problem of illegal bicycle parking in Hong Kong has not been thoroughly resolved. The departments should further strengthen and implement the spirit of interdepartmental collaboration with the shared goal of addressing the issue seriously and genuinely. Regarding illegal bicycle parking, the Office has made 17 improvement recommendations for the Working Group. The Working Group has accepted all of them and will implement our recommendations.""

The recommendations for improvement include:

• continue interdepartmental collaboration and closely monitor illegal bicycle parking;

• continue conducting large-scale joint operations at the Location at least once a month;

• consider increasing the frequency of reviews on the effectiveness of joint operations from a biannual to a quarterly or even monthly basis, and adjust enforcement strategies as needed;

• during routine patrols, promptly clear or at least prioritise the removal of illegally parked bicycles that severely obstruct pedestrian walkways or pose a danger to pedestrians;

• explore the introduction of innovative smart surveillance systems, including the pilot installation of AI-enabled cameras at the Location to identify illegally parked bicycles, with a view to enhancing enforcement effectiveness;

• consider increasing the number of bicycle parking places or expanding existing facilities near the Location to better accommodate the parking needs of the public and the rental shops;

• drawing on management practices for car parks, explore the feasibility of implementing double-deck parking racks at bicycle parking places; and

• enhance communication and consultations with shop operators at the Location, and also solicit their views and explore concrete and effective improvement measures to address illegal parking.

The full investigation report has been uploaded to the website of the Office of The Ombudsman at www.ombudsman.hk for public information."
Government welcomes Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's plan to set up office in Hong Kong,2025-11-03 11:00,2025-11-03 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110200193.htm,"  The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) today (November 3) announced its plan to set up an office in Hong Kong to address its growing business needs. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government welcomes the AIIB's plan and is committed to assisting the AIIB in further promoting the sustainable development of infrastructure in Asia.

  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""The Chief Executive announced in his Policy Address this year that we will actively invite the AIIB to set up an office in Hong Kong. We are very glad to hear the positive decision of the AIIB on setting up an office in Hong Kong and will actively meet the AIIB's needs to render support for the establishment of the office. As an AIIB member, Hong Kong, China is committed to assisting the AIIB in fully leveraging our vibrant capital markets, world-class professional services, and diversified financial products to support the Bank's operations in project financing, bond issuance, and investment and financial management, among others. Hong Kong, China will continue to capitalise on its unique advantages of connectivity with both the Mainland and the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle, with a view to making an active contribution to the AIIB's long-term development.""

  The AIIB was established in January 2016, and Hong Kong, China has formally been an AIIB member since June 2017. As a multilateral development bank, the AIIB's mission is to foster sustainable economic development, create wealth, and improve infrastructure connectivity in Asia by investing in infrastructure and other productive sectors.

二○二六年一月二十五日起公交和商用車座位乘客均須佩戴安全帶　司機駕駛時不可使用多於兩部流動電訊裝置（附圖）,2025-11-03 10:05,2025-11-03 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110100561.htm,"運輸署今日（十一月三日）提醒市民，由二○二六年一月二十五日起，所有公共交通工具和商用車的座位乘客均須佩戴安全帶。同日起，任何司機在駕駛時均不可使用多於兩部流動電訊裝置。兩項新規定旨在進一步加強道路、乘車和駕駛安全。

（一）延伸強制安裝和佩戴安全帶的要求

由明年一月二十五日起，所有新登記的公共及私家巴士（包括專營巴士及學生服務車輛）的所有乘客座位；私家小巴（包括學生服務車輛）和貨車的後排乘客座位；及特別用途車輛的司機和所有乘客座位，均須安裝安全帶。同日起，乘坐這些車輛時，如座位已安裝安全帶，不論車輛是否新登記，座位乘客均須佩戴。任何車主、司機或乘客如違反安裝或佩戴安全帶的規定，最高可處罰款5,000元及監禁三個月。

司機需注意，15歲以下乘客如在貨車後座或特別用途車輛乘客座位未佩戴安全帶但司機仍駕駛，司機最高可處罰款2,000元。所有乘客則須為佩戴安全帶自行負責。

此外，為加強保障學童並平衡業界的營運需要，現有學生服務車輛須於二○二八年十二月三十一日前，在所有乘客座位加裝安全帶及保護式座椅。由該日起，如車輛未符合此規定，將不可接載學生。至於專營巴士，所有新購巴士自二○一八年七月起已於所有座位安裝安全帶，營辦商亦已為約1 900輛現有巴士的所有上層座位加裝安全帶。

運輸署發言人說：「佩戴安全帶能在意外中有效保護乘客，研究顯示可減低司機和乘客在迎頭相撞意外中死亡和重傷的風險分別約四成和七成。同時，學生服務車輛全面落實安裝安全帶，有助學童從小培養佩戴安全帶的習慣，加強道路安全的意識。」

（二）加強規管駕駛時使用流動電訊裝置

司機專注駕駛對道路安全至關重要。在平衡運輸業界的需要及科技發展等考慮，由明年一月二十五日起，任何司機駕駛時不可在前方放置多於兩部流動電訊裝置，即流動電話、平板或手提電腦，而有關裝置的屏幕對角長度不可超過19厘米。流動電訊裝置不能阻礙司機目視道路及交通情況，以及對觀察路況用的鏡、裝置或攝像顯示器的視線。

發言人表示，違反上述規定的司機最高可判處罰款2,000元。

運輸署會聯同警方、相關部門、道路安全議會及公共運輸服務營辦商加強宣傳及公眾教育，向司機和乘客介紹法例要求。署方亦會陸續與運輸業界進行宣傳工作。市民可參閱運輸署有關安全帶（www.td.gov.hk/tc/road_safety/sb）和駕駛時使用流動電訊裝置（www.td.gov.hk/tc/road_safety/mtd）的網頁、Agent T Facebook專頁（www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk），或致電熱線2804 2600了解詳情。

"Public transport and commercial vehicle seated passengers must wear seat belts and drivers must not use more than two mobile telecommunications devices while driving from January 25, 2026 (with photo)",2025-11-03 10:05,2025-11-03 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/03/P2025110100584.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (November 3) reminded members of the public that, starting from January 25, 2026, all public transport and commercial vehicles' seated passengers must wear seat belts. From the same day onwards, all drivers must not use more than two mobile telecommunications devices (MTDs) during driving. Both new requirements aim to further enhance road, passenger and driving safety.

(1) Extending requirements for mandatory fitting and wearing of seat belts

  All passenger's seats in public and private buses (including franchised buses and student service vehicles (SSVs)); rear passenger's seats in private light buses (including SSVs) and goods vehicles (GVs); and driver's seats and all passenger's seats of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) must be equipped with seat belts for these vehicles first registered from January 25, 2026. From the same day, passengers occupying the seats of these vehicles (whether newly registered or not), where seat belts are fitted, will be required to wear them. Any vehicle owner, driver or passenger breaching the seat belt-fitting or wearing requirements will be liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for up to three months.

  Of note, any driver who still operates the vehicle with a passenger aged under 15 seated in the rear seat of a GV or the passenger's seat of an SPV without wearing a seat belt will be subject to a maximum fine of $2,000. All passengers seated in the seats shall be responsible for wearing the seat belts.

  In addition, to strike a balance between enhancing protection for students and addressing the trade's operational needs, existing SSVs must retrofit seat belts and safer seats on all passenger seats before December 31, 2028. From that day onwards, vehicles failing to meet such requirement will no longer be permitted to carry students. As for franchised buses, all newly procured buses have been equipped with seat belts on every seat since July 2018 and operators have retrofitted seat belts on all upper deck seats of about 1 900 existing buses.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""Wearing seat belts offers effective protection to passengers in an accident. Studies show that it will reduce the risk of death and serious injury of drivers and passengers in head-on collisions by about 40 per cent and 70 per cent respectively. Further, the full implementation of the fitting of seat belts in SSVs helps cultivate the habit of wearing seat belts from an early age, thereby strengthening students' awareness of road safety.""

(2) Tightening use of MTDs during driving

  Driving attentively is key to road safety. Balancing considerations including the transport trades' needs and technological advancements, from January 25, 2026, any driver must not place more than two MTDs (i.e. mobile phones, tablet computers or laptop computers) in front of them during driving. The diagonal length of their screen must not exceed 19 centimetres. The MTDs must not obstruct the driver's view of the road and traffic as well as any mirror, device or camera-monitor fitted for viewing the roads.

  Drivers contravening the new requirements may be liable to a maximum fine of $2,000, the spokesman added.

  The TD will work with the Police, relevant departments, the Road Safety Council and public transport operators to step up publicity and public education for drivers and passengers on the legal requirements. The TD will also conduct publicity works for transport trades gradually. Members of the public may refer to the TD's webpage on seat belts (www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/sb) and the use of MTDs during driving (www.td.gov.hk/en/road_safety/mtd) or the Agent T Facebook page (www.facebook.com/AgentT.hk), or call the hotline 2804 2600 for details.

  Following the passage by the Legislative Council, the Road Traffic (Construction and Maintenance of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025, the Road Traffic (Safety Equipment) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 and the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025 will come into effect on January 25, 2026."

Labour Department highly concerned about fatal work accident that happened in Sau Mau Ping today,2025-11-02 23:02,2025-11-02 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/02/P2025110200753.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about a fatal work accident that happened at a construction site in Sau Mau Ping this afternoon (November 2), in which a male worker, while erecting a bamboo scaffold on the external wall of a building under construction, fell from height. He was certified dead at the scene. The LD is saddened by the death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

  The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending the erection, alteration, dismantling and use of bamboo scaffolds on the external walls of the buildings in the site. The contractors cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

  The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""

   To prevent workers from falling from height while engaged in scaffolding work, the LD reminds employers to take suitable safety measures, including providing every scaffolder with a suitable safety harness that is attached continuously to a suitable and secure anchor point, an independent lifeline or a fall arresting system, and ensuring the proper use of the safety equipment by the workers concerned throughout the work.

  The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

  In regard to today's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident concerned to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

  The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of the family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

  For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should also co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."

大家好！今天非常高興和大家一起，慶祝中華人民共和國成立76周年，並見證香港浙江省同鄉會聯合會第十四屆理事會就職。首先，我向新一屆理事會成員，表示最熱烈的祝賀！

香港與浙江一直有緊密的聯繫。很多浙江鄉親和企業家，早年來到香港打拼，為香港戰後的工業發展帶來資金、技術和勞動力，為香港經濟起飛打下堅實基礎。

浙江地靈人傑，人才輩出。扎根香港的浙江鄉親，在商業、政治、文化、教育等不同領域努力奮鬥，成就卓越，為香港發展貢獻良多。

香港浙江省同鄉會聯合會自一九九八年成立以來，一直秉持愛國愛港、服務鄉親的宗旨，團結在香港的鄉親，支持特區政府依法施政，為香港的繁榮穩定作出積極貢獻。

多年來，浙聯會積極參與社區建設，舉辦不同類型的活動，讓市民了解家鄉文化與傳統；也組織義工隊，關心鄉親和弱勢群體，更承辦地區關愛隊，在社區提供貼心服務，在緊急時刻及時支援有需要居民。

浙聯會也是連接浙江與香港的重要橋樑，不僅組織交流活動，推動企業合作，還開展多個青年交流項目，讓年輕人多走多看，親身感受浙江的歷史文化和創新發展，培養年輕人的愛國情懷。

今年是新中國成立76周年，也是謀劃國家「十五五」規劃之年。香港是國際金融、貿易和航運中心，而浙江是國家經濟大省，兩地加強合作，對配合國家發展具有重要意義。

今年四月，「浙港合作會議」第一次會議在杭州舉行，並在會上簽署了備忘錄，確立了13個合作領域，標誌着兩地合作踏上新台階。

特區政府期望與浙江繼續攜手深化合作，優勢互補，共同把握國家發展機遇，為國家改革開放和中華民族偉大復興作出更大貢獻。

剛才詹會長也提出了，相信大家都知道，十二月七日是立法會選舉投票日的重要日子。在這裏，我當然要呼籲大家，踴躍參與選舉，投下重要的一票，選出為香港服務、為市民發聲的立法會議員，共同為香港繁榮穩定努力。

最後，我祝願國家國泰民安，浙港兩地百業興旺，香港浙江省同鄉會聯合會會務蒸蒸日上，新一屆理事會工作順利！

謝謝大家。"

香港的地理位置具有得天獨厚的優勢。回歸祖國後，香港積極融入國家發展大局，充分發揮「一國兩制」的獨特優勢。我們要做好「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的工作，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。同樣，廈門擁有獨特的地理優勢，在推動兩岸融合與「一帶一路」倡議發展中發揮着重要作用。作為最早設立的經濟特區之一和海上絲綢之路核心區內的城市，廈門是國家東南沿海的經濟與物流樞紐，四十多年來一直維持高水平對外開放，外資企業數目持續快速增長。廈門與香港同為連接內地與國際市場的重要橋樑。通過深化合作，兩地必將優勢互補、加速高質量發展，為國家繁榮進一步貢獻力量。

香港廈門聯誼總會秉持愛國、愛港、愛鄉的宗旨，致力團結鄉親，服務社會，全力支持特區政府依法施政，維護香港繁榮穩定。總會通過參與社會事務和舉辦包括青年教育、經貿交流、慈善公益、文化傳承等活動，弘揚閩南文化，促進廈港兩地合作與發展，我非常支持和表示敬佩。

在洪頂超主席和施佳汶監事長的領導下，我相信新一屆理監事會一定能夠承先啓後，團結社會各界，共同建設香港，為國家創造更美好的未來。

最後，我想向各位廈門鄉親作一個呼籲。第八屆立法會的選舉將在十二月七日舉行。過去數年清楚顯示，一個有能力、有幹勁、有擔當的立法會，是可以監察和配合行政機關推行大量有利社會經濟發展的法例和政策措施，提升香港的營商環境、國際競爭力和市民的民生福祉。所以，我請大家屆時積極投票，行使法律賦予你的權利，選出最有能力、熱誠和擔當，且才德兼備的候選人，進入立法會服務國家、服務香港和服務你。十二月七日記得投票！謝謝大家。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-02 17:44,2025-11-02 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/02/P2025110200539.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得54宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案。兩宗屬本地個案，52宗屬輸入個案。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於鳳德商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話及於鳳德邨進行上門探訪，已為約10 700名居民作評估，並已安排39名出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，化驗工作正陸續進行。截至今日下午五時，中心已完成檢驗36名市民的血液樣本，全部對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月二十六日至十一月一日）廣東省新增259宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十月十九日至二十五日）的868宗顯著下降。上周個案主要分布在佛山市（51宗）、深圳市（48宗）、江門市（44宗）廣州市（37宗）及珠海市（18宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

政府繼續全方位防控基孔肯雅熱
——————————————

中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

中心人員和當區關愛隊會繼續聯絡區內居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

另外，中心由十月二十六日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及上述的醫護站，每日由上午九時至下午八時運作，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估和解答市民有關基孔肯雅熱的查詢。

食物環境衛生署（食環署）聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-02 17:44,2025-11-02 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/02/P2025110200544.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 2), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-------------------------------

 So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 54 confirmed CF cases, including two local cases and 52 imported cases.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for about 10 700 residents through the health consultation booth on the second floor of Fung Tak Shopping Centre, its inquiry hotline and door-to-door visits in Fung Tak Estate. Among them, 39 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests. Laboratory testing is continuing. As of 5pm today, 36 samples have completed testing and are all negative for the chikungunya virus.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 259 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 26 to November 1), showing a decrease compared to the previous week (October 19 to 25), which reported 868 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Foshan (51 cases), Shenzhen (48 cases), Jiangmen (44 cases), Guangzhou (37 cases) and Zhuhai (18 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Government's continuous comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams will continue to contact the residents in the district, disseminate information, and understand and follow up on their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant.

In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and the abovementioned health consultation booth. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily to provide assessments to residents with relevant symptoms and answer enquiries relating to CF.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
ã
The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
15th National Games torch relay successfully held (with photos/videos),2025-11-02 17:38,2025-11-02 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/02/P2025110200473.htm,"The 15th National Games (NG) will be opened on November 9. To welcome this landmark sporting event, jointly hosted for the first time by Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, the torch relay in Hong Kong competition region was held today (November 2). Fifty torchbearers representing various sectors—including sports, sponsors, volunteers, the youth, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities—participated, fully showcasing Hong Kong's open, diverse, and inclusive character.

The torch relay launching ceremony was held at 9am in Shenzhen, followed by starting ceremonies in Hong Kong, Macao and Guangzhou at 9.30am, where torch relay started simultaneously. The total route length in Hong Kong is approximately 10 kilometers, divided into five segments. Starting from the Central Government Offices in Tamar, with Hong Kong table tennis athlete Wong Chun-ting serving as the first torchbearer, the Hong Kong route passed through the Central and Western District Promenade (Central Section), the Wan Chai Temporary Promenade, the Monument in Commemoration of Return of Hong Kong to China and Golden Bauhinia Square. The second section saw the torchbearers crossed the Victoria Harbour by Star Ferry, then proceed to the third section in Tsim Sha Tsui. They started from Star Ferry Bus Terminus in Tsim Sha Tsui in Salisbury Road to Mody Lane, passing by the Hong Kong Cultural Centre and Hong Kong Museum of Art. Torchbearers of the fourth section took an open-top bus to the bus terminal at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP). After entering KTSP, the torchbearers of the fifth section passed by the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground and the Kai Tak Sports Avenue before arriving at the Kai Tak Sports Park Central Square. The last torchbearer, Hong Kong fencing athlete Kaylin Hsieh, lighted the cauldron and the closing ceremony took place.

Addressing at the launching ceremony of torch relay in Hong Kong, the Acting Chief Executive, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, said torch relay events which were held in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao on the same day this time are not only a great innovation but also demonstrate the unique advantages of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The GBA will work together for integrated development and greater strength to establish a global top-notch bay area and world-class city cluster.

Representatives of the four cities will return the flame to Guangzhou after the torch relay. A flame-gathering ceremony will be held in the Guangdong Olympic Sports Center, bridging the torch relay at the venue and the lighting of the main torch at the 15th NG opening ceremony.

The biggest highlight of the 15th NG torch relay is the collaborative progress of the three places and the relay among the four cities. The unique feature of the joint hosting of the 15th NG by the three places has been fully demonstrated, from the lighting of the ""source flame"" in Nansha, Guangzhou by the representatives of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau earlier October to the simultaneous torch relay events in four locations today."

尊敬的何巡視員（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室宣傳文體部二級巡視員何德軍）、蘇部長（深圳市委宣傳部副部長、市新聞出版局局長、市政府新聞辦主任蘇榮才）、傅董（聯合出版（集團）有限公司董事長傅偉中）、唐董（深圳出版集團董事長唐漢隆）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好！歡迎大家蒞臨「香港參與第26屆深圳讀書月」的開幕禮。這是文化體育及旅遊局連續第三年，率領香港業界參與由深圳市委宣傳部主辦的「深圳讀書月」。

習近平主席曾指出，中華民族自古提倡閱讀，講究格物致知、誠意正心，傳承中華民族生生不息的精神，塑造中國人民自信自強的品格。

書籍，是人類文明的載體；閱讀，是獲取知識與社會進步的基石。中華五千年文明綿延不絕，其中一個原因就在於我們擁有世代相傳的典籍與優良的閱讀傳統。

為此，在深港「共讀雙城」計劃下，香港除了參與「深圳讀書月」，也會邀請深圳同業參與「香港全民閱讀日」，攜手推動書香灣區。

今年我們會在「深圳讀書月」呈現約30項精彩活動，包括由今天起到十一月十六日在深業上城這裏舉辦的「字遊香港漫步城市」主題展覽暨書展，以香港隨處可見的字體為主軸，引領觀眾從字體角度欣賞香港獨特的視覺美學、街頭文化與城市氣質。

另外，十一月二十九及三十日在深圳圖書館及深業上城小劇場舉辦的「大灣區史志研究與文旅融合」研討會，是去年深港史志研討會的延續。今年更廣泛地邀請大灣區各地持份者，系統梳理史志成果轉化與傳播，同時推動出版界與學術界合作。

我熱切期待明年深圳出版界在深圳市委宣傳部安排下再度參與「香港閱讀+」，讓更多香港讀者有機會欣賞到深圳圖書，持續深化港深兩地的文化交流與合作。

在建設粵港澳大灣區的國家戰略引領下，香港會繼續發揮「中外文化藝術交流中心」重要定位，以書為媒，以字為橋，推動文化、體育和旅遊協同發展，充分發揮香港中西薈萃的獨特優勢，促進文明互鑑、民心相通。
 
在此，我要感謝香港出版總會協助文化體育及旅遊局籌辦「香港參與第26屆深圳讀書月」項目，以及香港出版界的大力支持，讓有關項目成為深圳民眾一年一度期待參與的文化盛事。香港立法會新一屆選舉即將來臨，我亦藉此呼籲出版界的朋友鼓勵員工與家人一起投入選舉，共創未來。

最後，我也要感謝深圳市委宣傳部、深圳讀書月組委會、深圳圖書館、深業上城的支持和協助。我在此預祝本屆「深圳讀書月」所有活動圓滿成功。謝謝。"

In addition, with the co-ordination of Tokyo ETO and InvestHK, members of the delegation will meet with senior representatives of Cyberport and join a series of keynote sessions, panel discussions, and investor matching activities at the Cyberport Venture Capital Forum 2025, as well as attend the Elevator Pitch International Competition 2025 organised by Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation, fostering exchanges and collaboration among enterprises.

  Marking its 10th anniversary, the Hong Kong FinTech Week and StartmeupHK Festival not only celebrate a decade of Hong Kong's innovation journey but also highlight the deep integration of technology and economic growth, serving as an iconic symbol of Hong Kong's forward-looking development. Last year's event attracted over 37 000 participants from more than 100 economies, featuring over 800 speakers and 700 sponsors and exhibitors, underscoring its global scale and influence.

  Tokyo ETO will continue to strengthen Japanese enterprises' understanding of Hong Kong's latest policy initiatives and business opportunities, encouraging overseas companies to leverage Hong Kong's global advantages to expand their business worldwide. At the same time, Tokyo ETO will support the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global launched earlier, supporting Mainland companies in expanding their overseas business, with a view to underlining Hong Kong's dual roles in ""going global and attracting foreign investment""."
