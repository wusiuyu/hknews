​第二次深港醫療衞生合作專班會議（附圖）,2025-12-11 17:10,2025-12-11 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100233.htm,"醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授與深圳市衞生健康委員會（衞健委）主任吳紅艷今日（十二月十一日）在香港主持第二次深港醫療衞生合作專班會議（專班會議），兩地醫療衞生官員就持續推進兩地跨境醫療協作作深入討論。

醫衞局與深圳市衞健委在專班會議上就二○二三年九月簽訂的《深港醫療衞生合作框架協議》（《協議》）中各項工作，包括醫療服務、醫院質量國際認證和臨床試驗協作等多個範疇，進行交流及討論，促進兩地藥械及醫療服務流通。

盧寵茂教授說︰「《協議》定下了多個深港醫療衞生合作項目。過去兩年，深港合作取得了顯著進展，雙方在跨境醫療服務、人才交流及醫療創新等方面都取得堅實成果，包括在二○二四年推出『長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃』，並於今年中實現大灣區九個內地城市全覆蓋；以及在去年推出『大灣區跨境直通救護車試行計劃』。」

會上，盧寵茂教授談及香港公立醫院積極採納《國際醫院評審認證標準（中國）》（2021版）進行認證。他説：「香港特別行政區（特區）醫療機構採納國家醫療標準進行認證，除了能提升自身的醫療專業水平與服務質量外，亦有助與國家醫療衞生服務體系接軌，並且充分發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，向國際社會展示國家醫療標準的卓越性，助力國家醫療標準走向國際。」

就生物醫藥創新合作方面，盧寵茂教授表示：「香港特區政府積極響應國家戰略與政策指引，繼去年成立粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所後，今年將成立真實世界研究及應用中心。特區政府期望透過粵港澳大灣區城市合作，共同將大灣區打造成為國家乃至全球領先的醫療創新高地，大力發展新質生產力。」

「香港特區政府會繼續按照優勢互補、互利共贏的原則，在有利於內地與香港醫療發展的前提下，加強與內地各省市在醫療服務發展方面的合作，共同提高醫療水平。未來，我們會繼續致力促進大灣區醫療合作，共同為推動國家『健康中國』的重要戰略作出貢獻。」

醫院管理局行政總裁李夏茵醫生和衞生署規管事務總監封螢醫生亦有出席今日的會議。"
Second meeting of Task Force for Medical Collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong held (with photos),2025-12-11 17:10,2025-12-11 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100227.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, and the Director General of the Public Hygiene and Health Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, Ms Wu Hongyan, hosted the second meeting of the Task Force for Medical Collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong in Hong Kong today (December 11). Health officials from both places had in-depth discussions on the continued advancement of cross-boundary medical collaboration between the two cities.

  The Health Bureau and the Public Hygiene and Health Commission of Shenzhen Municipality had exchanges and discussions at the Task Force meeting on various work under the Framework Agreement on Medical Collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong signed in September 2023, including healthcare services, hospital quality accreditation on an international level, and clinical trial collaboration, to facilitate the flow of drugs and medical devices, as well as healthcare services between the two places.

  Professor Lo said, ""The Framework Agreement established multiple medical collaboration initiatives between Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Over the past two years, the collaboration between Shenzhen and Hong Kong has achieved significant progress, with both sides securing solid outcomes in areas such as cross-boundary healthcare services, talent exchange, as well as health and medical innovation, including the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme, which was launched in 2024 and achieved full coverage of the nine Mainland cities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in mid-2025, and the Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in the GBA, which was launched last year.""

  During the meeting, Professor Lo mentioned that public hospitals in Hong Kong have been adopting the China's International Hospital Accreditation Standards (2021 Version) for accreditation. He said, ""By adopting national healthcare standards for accreditation, healthcare institutions in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) can not only enhance their healthcare professional standards and service quality but also facilitate their alignment with the national healthcare service system. This can also demonstrate the excellence of the national healthcare standards to the international community through fully leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantages of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, thereby facilitating the national standards in going global.""

  Regarding the collaboration in biomedicine innovation, Professor Lo said, ""In active response to the national strategies and policy guidance, the HKSAR Government established the GBA International Clinical Trial Institute last year and will establish the Real-World Study and Application Centre this year. Through collaboration with cities in the GBA, the HKSAR Government aspires to jointly build the GBA into a leading hub for health and medical innovation both nationally and globally, vigorously developing new quality productive forces.

   ""Under the principle of complementarity and mutual benefits, and on the premise of benefitting the healthcare development of both the Mainland and Hong Kong, the HKSAR Government will continue to strengthen co-operation on healthcare service development with various Mainland provinces and cities for levelling up healthcare quality. Looking ahead, we will remain committed to fostering healthcare co-operation within the GBA, with a view to contributing to propelling the important national strategy of 'Healthy China' through concerted efforts.""

  The Chief Executive of the Hospital Authority, Dr Libby Lee, and the Controller of Regulatory Affairs of the Department of Health, Dr Fung Ying, also attended today's meeting."
一名女子涉嫌非法管有及銷售含有已禁用和受管制藥物成分的減肥產品被捕（附圖）,2025-12-11 17:00,2025-12-11 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100543.htm,"​因應有人在社交媒體平台涉嫌違法銷售含有已禁用和未標示受管制藥物成分的減肥藥，衞生署今日（十二月十一日）聯同警方在將軍澳及大埔採取執法行動。行動中，拘捕一名27歲的女子。

衞生署根據情報，早前透過即時通訊軟件購獲兩款減肥產品的樣本，送交政府化驗所進行化驗。結果顯示，其中一個盛載在黑色膠樽、包裝上標示「HELLO GIRL time to show your figure」的膠囊樣本（見圖一）含有「西布曲明」和「呋塞米」；另一款膠囊產品則盛載在沒有任何標示和包裝的藍色膠樽（見圖二），樣本證實含有「西布曲明」、「去甲基西布曲明」和「呋塞米」。三種成分均屬《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章）（《條例》）下的第1部毒藥。上述兩款產品亦懷疑屬未經註冊藥劑製品。

衞生署呼籲已購買上述產品的市民立即停止服用，市民亦切勿購買或服用成分或來歷不明的產品。衞生署會繼續調查事件和採取適當跟進。

「西布曲明」曾用於抑壓食慾，由於會增加心血管疾病的風險，含「西布曲明」的藥劑製品自二○一○年十一月起已被禁止在香港使用和出售。「去甲基西布曲明」的化學結構則與「西布曲明」類似。「呋塞米」用以治療心臟病，副作用包括低血壓和電解質不平衡。含有「呋塞米」的藥劑製品只可在醫生指示下使用，並憑醫生處方在註冊藥劑師監督下於獲授權毒藥銷售商（即藥房）出售。

根據《條例》，所有藥劑製品須獲香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局註冊，方可於市面銷售。非法售賣或管有未經註冊藥劑製品或第1部毒藥均屬刑事罪行，每項罪行一經定罪最高罰款100,000元及監禁兩年。

衞生署提醒市民，所有已註冊的藥劑製品必須在包裝上附有香港註冊編號，格式為「HK-XXXXX」。未經註冊藥劑製品的安全、素質及效能均未獲保證。

已購買相關產品的市民應立即停止服用，如有疑問或服用後感到不適，應立即徵詢醫護人員的意見。市民可於辦公時間內，將有關產品交予九龍彌敦道345號永安九龍中心18樓1804-06室衞生署藥物辦公室銷毀。

市民要控制體重，應注意均衡飲食及做適量運動。在服用任何藥物作體重控制用途前，應先諮詢醫護人員的意見。衞生署藥物辦公室網頁上載了「有關肥胖問題及纖體產品的健康訊息」及「含未標示西藥成分減肥產品」的資料，供市民參閱。"
Woman arrested on suspicion of illegally possessing and selling slimming products containing banned and controlled drug ingredients (with photos),2025-12-11 17:00,2025-12-11 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100556.htm,"âIn response to suspected illegal sales of slimming products containing banned and undeclared controlled drug ingredients on social media platforms, the Department of Health (DH) today (December 11) carried out enforcement operations in Tseung Kwan O and Tai Po with the Police. During the operations, a 27-year-old woman was arrested.

Acting upon intelligence, the DH had earlier purchased samples oftwo slimming products via an instant messaging application and sent them to the Government Laboratory for analysis. The test results revealed that one capsule sample, packaged in a black plastic container labelled ""HELLO GIRL time to show your figure"" (see photo 1), contained sibutramine and frusemide. The other capsule sample, packaged in an unlabelled blue plastic container (see photo 2), contained sibutramine, N-desmethylsibutramine and frusemide. All three ingredients are Part 1 poisons under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138) (PPO). The two products concerned are also suspected to be unregistered pharmaceutical products.

The DH urged members of the public who have purchased the products concerned to stop consuming them immediately, and reminded the public not to buy or consume products of doubtful composition or from unknown sources. The DH will continue to investigate the incident and take appropriate follow-up actions.

Sibutramine was once used as an appetite suppressant. Since November 2010, pharmaceutical products containing sibutramine have been banned for use and sale in Hong Kong due to an increased cardiovascular risk. N-desmethylsibutramine is a substance structurally similar to sibutramine. Frusemide is used for the treatment of heart diseases, and its side effects include low blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance. Medicines containing frusemide should be used under a doctor's direction and be supplied on the premises of an Authorized Seller of Poisons (i.e. pharmacy) under the supervision of a registered pharmacist upon a doctor's prescription.

According to the PPO, all pharmaceutical products must be registered with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong before they can be sold in the market. Illegal sale or possession of unregistered pharmaceutical products or Part 1 poisons are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for each offence upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment.

The DH reminded members of the public that all registered pharmaceutical products should carry a Hong Kong registration number on the package in the format of ""HK-XXXXX"". The safety, quality and efficacy of unregistered pharmaceutical products are not guaranteed.

People who have purchased the products concerned should stop consuming them immediately and consult healthcare professionals if in doubt or if they feel unwell after consumption. They may submit the products to the Drug Office of the DH at Room 1804-06, 18/F, Wing On Kowloon Centre, 345 Nathan Road, Kowloon, during office hours for disposal.

Weight control should be achieved through a balanced diet and appropriate exercise. The public should consult healthcare professionals before consuming any medication for weight control. They may visit the website of the Drug Office of the DH for ""Health message on overweight problem and slimming products"" and ""Slimming products with undeclared Western drug ingredients"" for information."
"金管局與證監會合作執法行動----瑞士盈豐銀行股份有限公司因違反監管規定及內部監控缺失遭證監會譴責及罰款1,085萬港元",2025-12-11 16:40,2025-12-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100278.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）譴責瑞士盈豐銀行股份有限公司（瑞士盈豐），並處以罰款1,085萬港元，原因是該公司在二○一五年一月至二○二○年十二月期間（有關期間）犯有產品盡職審查、備存紀錄及延遲匯報的缺失（註一及二）。

證監會的調查源自瑞士盈豐的主動匯報及香港金融管理局（金管局）轉交的調查結果（註三）。

在產品盡職審查方面，瑞士盈豐在評估322隻債券時，沒有考慮不同產品的專有特點，亦沒有及時更新其內部政策以反映監管變動。瑞士盈豐亦沒有確保在每次交易時或之前，就若干複雜產品的分銷向客戶提供充分資料及警告聲明。

至於備存紀錄及延遲匯報方面，瑞士盈豐沒有就141隻債券備存產品盡職審查紀錄，及於二○二○年七月首次懷疑出現產品盡職審查缺失時，沒有立即向證監會作出匯報（註四）。

證監會在決定採取上述處分時，已考慮到所有相關情況，包括：


瑞士盈豐已採取補救措施，以加強其產品盡職審查的框架；
瑞士盈豐與金管局及證監會合作解決在調查過程中發現的關注事項；及
瑞士盈豐將實施加強的投訴處理程序，以檢視在有關期間內購買了受影響產品的客戶的投訴（註五）。


有關紀律行動聲明（當中附有該351項產品的列表）載於證監會網站。

註一：此新聞稿由證監會及金管局共同發出。
註二：瑞士盈豐根據《證券及期貨條例》獲發牌進行第1類（證券交易）、第4類（就證券提供意見）及第9類（提供資產管理）受規管活動。
註三：金管局在瑞士盈豐主動匯報其產品盡職審查缺失後進行調查，並將調查結果轉交證監會跟進。
註四：違反《證券及期貨事務監察委員會持牌人或註冊人操守準則》及《適用於證券及期貨事務監察委員會持牌人或註冊人的管理、監督及內部監控指引》。
註五：制訂加強的投訴處理程序是為確保瑞士盈豐深入覆核有關交易，從而以公平合理的方式處理投訴。根據瑞士盈豐進行的影響評估，瑞士盈豐在有關期間內進行產品盡職審查時，可能沒有考慮到351項產品的專有特點。瑞士盈豐將以加強的投訴處理程序，處理在有關期間內曾購買該351項產品的客戶可能提出的任何投訴。"
Enforcement collaboration between HKMA and SFC - SFC reprimands and fines EFG Bank AG HK$10.85 million for regulatory breaches and internal control failures,2025-12-11 16:40,2025-12-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100288.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has reprimanded and fined EFG Bank AG (EFG) HK$10.85 million for failures relating to product due diligence, record-keeping and late reporting between January 2015 and December 2020 (Relevant Period) (Notes 1 and 2).

The SFC's investigation stemmed from a self-report from EFG and a referral of findings from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) (Note 3).

Regarding product due diligence, EFG failed to take into account special features of various products when conducting such assessment on 322 bonds and update its internal policies to reflect regulatory changes in a timely manner. It also failed to ensure that sufficient information and warning statements relating to the distribution of certain complex products were provided to customers before or at the point of each transaction.

As for record keeping and late reporting, EFG failed to keep product due diligence records for 141 bonds, and it did not immediately report to the SFC its product due diligence failures when it first suspected of them in July 2020 (Note 4).

In deciding the sanctions, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including:


EFG has taken remedial measures to enhance its product due diligence framework;
EFG's cooperation with the HKMA and the SFC in resolving the concerns identified in the investigations; and
EFG will implement Enhanced Complaint Handling Procedures (ECHP) to review complaints from customers who have acquired the affected products during the Relevant Period (Note 5).


A copy of the Statement of Disciplinary Action (appended with a list of the 351 products) is available on theSFC website.

Note 1: This press release is issued jointly by the SFC and the HKMA.
Note 2: EFG is registered to carry on Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 9 (asset management) regulated activities under the Securities and Futures Ordinance.
Note 3: The HKMA referred its findings to the SFC following an investigation into EFG's self-report on its product due diligence failures.
Note 4: Contrary to the Code of Conduct for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC and the Management, Supervision and Internal Control Guidelines for Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC.
Note 5: The ECHP is designed to ensure that EFG conducts an intensive review into the relevant transactions to ensure that complaints are resolved in a fair and reasonable manner. According to an impact assessment by EFG, it might have failed to take into account special features for 351 products when conducting product due diligence during the Relevant Period. EFG shall apply the ECHP to any complaints which may be made by customers who have acquired any of these 351 products during the Relevant Period."
二零二五年第三季建造工程完成量統計數字,2025-12-11 16:30,2025-12-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100293.htm,"政府統計處今日（十二月十一日）公布「建造工程完成量按季統計調查」的臨時結果。主要承建商於二零二五年第三季所完成的建造工程名義總值的總計為734億元，較上年同期下跌1.5%。

剔除價格變動的影響後，臨時結果顯示以實質計算，主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值的總計於同期間下跌5.5%。以實質計算的建造工程完成量總值，是透過適當的物價指數去平減相應的建造工程完成量名義總值至二零零零年基期的價格水平計算而成。

按建造工程類別分析，於二零二五年第三季完成的私人地盤建造工程名義總值為169億元，較上年同期下跌18.1%。以實質計算，跌幅為20.8%。於二零二五年第三季完成的公營地盤建造工程名義總值較上年同期上升7.7%至341億元。以實質計算，升幅為2.0%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第三季所完成的非地盤建造工程名義總值為224億元，較上年同期輕微上升0.7%。以實質計算，則輕微下跌0.4%。非地盤建造工程包括小規模新建工程及樓房裝飾、樓宇修葺及保養工程，和非地盤的電器設備安裝及保養工程。

按主要用途類別分析，住宅樓宇建造工程於二零二五年第三季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值為213億元，較上年同期輕微上升0.9%。同期間，運輸工程於二零二五年第三季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值下跌32.3%至76億元。

以經季節性調整的數字按季比較，主要承建商於二零二五年第三季完成的建造工程名義總值較二零二五年第二季上升1.8%。以實質計算，升幅為0.1%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第三季所完成的建造工程總值臨時數字列載於表1。二零二五年第二季的修訂數字則列載於表2。

由於分判建造工程在建造業內十分普遍，一間建造業公司可以是某一合約的主要承建商，同時亦可以是另一合約的分判承建商。主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值，只包括該等建造業公司作為主要承建商合約中所完成的建造工程，而不包括其作為分判承建商所完成的建造工程。然而，分判承建商所完成的建造工程總值，應已包括在其受聘的主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值之內。

建造業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各經濟統計調查，把經濟單位撥歸不同的行業類別。

Construction output for third quarter of 2025,2025-12-11 16:30,2025-12-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100295.htm,"The total gross value of construction works (GVCW) performed by main contractors in the third quarter of 2025 decreased by 1.5% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $73.4 billion, according to the provisional results of the Quarterly Survey of Construction Output released today (December 11) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

After discounting the effect of price changes, the provisional results showed that the total GVCW performed by main contractors decreased by 5.5% in real terms over the same period. GVCW in real terms is derived by deflating the corresponding nominal value with an appropriate price index to the price level in the base period of 2000.

Analysed by type of construction works, the GVCW performed at private sector sites totalled $16.9 billion in the third quarter of 2025, down by 18.1% in nominal terms over a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 20.8%. The GVCW performed at public sector sites increased by 7.7% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $34.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025. In real terms, it increased by 2.0%.

The GVCW performed by main contractors at locations other than construction sites amounted to $22.4 billion in the third quarter of 2025, slightly up by 0.7% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier. In real terms, however, it slightly decreased by 0.4%. Construction works at locations other than construction sites included minor new construction activities and decoration, repair and maintenance for buildings; and electrical equipment installation and maintenance works at locations other than construction sites.

Analysed by major end-use group, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of residential buildings projects amounted to $21.3 billion in the third quarter of 2025, slightly up by 0.9% in nominal terms over a year earlier. Over the same period, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of transport projects down by 32.3% in nominal terms to $7.6 billion in the third quarter of 2025.

On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, the GVCW performed by main contractors increased by 1.8% in nominal terms and 0.1% in real terms in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the second quarter of 2025.

Table 1 shows the provisional figures on the GVCW performed by main contractors in the third quarter of 2025. Table 2 shows the revised figures for the second quarter of 2025.

Owing to the widespread sub-contracting practices in the construction industry, a construction company can be a main contractor for one contract and a sub-contractor for another contract at the same time. The GVCW performed by main contractors covers only those projects in which the construction company takes the role of a main contractor, but not projects in which it takes only the role of a sub-contractor. However, sub-contractors' contribution to projects should have been included in the GVCW performed by main contractors for whom they worked.

The classification in the construction sector follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on the Quarterly Survey of Construction Output"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1090002&scode=330).

Artists Kingsley Ng and Angel Hui to represent Hong Kong at 61st International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia (with photo),2025-12-11 16:00,2025-12-11 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100275.htm,"  The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA), upon invitation from the Hong Kong Arts Development Council (HKADC), is collaborating with the HKADC for the first time to participate in the Collateral Event of the 61st International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia in Venice, Italy, from May to November 2026. The HKMoA and the HKADC will jointly present selected works of Hong Kong artists Kingsley Ng and Angel Hui at the exhibition to showcase Hong Kong's artistic diversity on the international stage.

  Curated by the HKMoA, the exhibition explores the poetic rhythms of everyday life, engaging in a dialogue with the curatorial theme ""In Minor Keys"" of the 61st International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia. Drawing on familiar yet fleeting moments from daily life in Hong Kong, the exhibition guides visitors on a journey of self-discovery within the flow of life.

  Born and raised in Hong Kong, the two participating artists excel in drawing inspiration from Hong Kong's cultural context and quotidian experiences, reinterpreting daily-life rhythms and aesthetics through varied mediums such as light, sound and installation. Ng, an established media artist, is known for his poetic, site-specific installations that extend the viewer's perceptions of life. His works have been presented extensively in notable exhibitions locally and internationally. Hui, a promising emerging artist, is skilled at integrating traditional Chinese cultural elements with contemporary artistic language, recreating everyday objects to evoke cross-cultural artistic possibilities. Together, the two Hong Kong artists, as keen observers of the nuances of urban daily life, are transforming their reflections into creative inspirations for connecting Hong Kong and Venice - two international metropolises from various perspectives, thereby demonstrating the vitality and accomplishment of Hong Kong art to the international audience.

  Established in 1895, the International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia is the world's oldest international exhibition of contemporary visual arts. In each edition, some 100 countries and regions join the national pavilions and collateral events. Since 2001, the HKADC has been participating in the International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia through a collateral event, aiming to promote Hong Kong's art development as well as cultural exchanges at international art platforms.

  To foster broader participation from fellow art practitioners and create opportunities for Hong Kong artists to advance their careers on the international stage, the selection of artists to participate in the exhibition was guided by a nomination and assessment process. The HKMoA had invited nominations from local tertiary institutions as well as professional art organisations. Artists or artist collectives directly commissioned by the museums and offices of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) in recent years were also included. The nomination list covered over 200 artists. A professional selection panel then shortlisted artists for the HKMoA's final consideration. The HKMoA has selected Ng and Hui from the shortlist.

  The curatorial team of the HKMoA is deeply honoured to be curating the Hong Kong Exhibition at the International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia.Established in 1962, the HKMoA is the city's first public art museum. For over six decades, it has been committed to collecting and promoting Hong Kong art, as well as fostering strong collaborative relationships within the sector. It has built up a wide network and extensive experience, nurturing the growth of local artists and actively fulfilling its role as ""theart museum of Hong Kong"". The HKMoA expressed hope that, by joining hands with the two artists, representative Hong Kong art will be impressively brought onto the global stage.

  The members of the selection panel are: Guest Professor of School of Intermedia Art of the China Academy of Art Professor Johnson Chang; Museum Expert Adviser of the LCSD Dr William Lim; Senior Advisor of the Mori Art Museum, Japan, Mr Fumio Nanjo; the Chairman of the Museum Advisory Committee of the LCSD, Professor Douglas So; Professor Wang Huangsheng from the Central Academy of Fine Arts; the Museum Director of the HKMoA, Dr Maria Mok; and the Curator (Modern and Hong Kong Art) of the HKMoA, Ms Prudence Ma.

  The Hong Kong Exhibition at the 61st International Art Exhibition - La Biennale di Venezia is presented by the LCSD and the HKADC and organised by the HKMoA and the HKADC. It will be held in Venice, Italy (Campo della Tana, Castello 2126, 30122), from May 9 to November 22, 2026.

兩位參展的藝術家均植根香港，擅長從香港文化及生活經驗中汲取靈感，並透過光影、聲效與裝置等媒介，重新演繹日常生活中的韻律與美學。資深媒體藝術家伍韶勁，善於以詩意的手法，藉着場域特定裝置拓展觀者對生活的感知維度，他的作品曾於海內外多個重要場域展出。新銳藝術家許開嬌的創作，巧妙糅合中國傳統文化與當代藝術語彙，透過對日常物件的再創造，激發出跨文化的藝術表達。兩位香港藝術家將並肩同行，將其對城市日常的細膩觀察和感悟轉化為創作靈感，以不同視角連結香港與威尼斯這兩座國際都會，在國際舞台呈獻香港藝術的豐富多采和卓越成就。

創立於一八九五年的威尼斯視藝雙年展，為全球歷史最悠久的國際當代藝術盛事，每屆約有一百個國家及地區以國家館及外圍展形式參與展出。自二○○一年起，藝發局以外圍展形式參與威尼斯視藝雙年展，推動本地藝術發展並促進香港與國際藝壇的交流。

為擴大業界參與及搭建本地藝術家邁向國際的事業階梯，參展藝術家透過提名及評選機制選出。香港藝術館邀請香港各大專院校及專業藝術機構提名本地藝術家，並納入近年康樂及文化事務署（康文署）轄下博物館及辦事處曾委約創作展品的本地藝術家參與選拔，共收到超過二百個提名。其後由專業遴選小組擬訂入選名單，再交予香港藝術館作最終考慮；藝術館從名單中甄選出伍韶勁和許開嬌。

香港藝術館策展團隊對於能夠策劃威尼斯視藝雙年展的香港展覽深感榮幸：「成立於一九六二年的香港藝術館，是香港第一所公營美術館，六十多年來一直致力於收藏與推動香港藝術，與業界建立了緊密的關係，並發展了廣闊的網絡和累積了豐富的經驗，扶持香港藝術家成長，積極扮演『香港的藝術館』此一角色。我們深信必定能與兩位藝術家攜手，把具代表性的香港藝術帶到國際舞台。」

是次遴選小組委員包括：中國美術學院跨媒體學院客座教授張頌仁、康文署博物館專家顧問林偉而博士、日本森美術館高級顧問南條史生、康文署博物館諮詢委員會主席蘇彰德教授、中央美術學院王璜生教授、香港藝術館總館長莫家詠博士和香港藝術館館長（現代及香港藝術）馬佩婷。

第61屆威尼斯視藝雙年展香港展由康文署與藝發局聯合主辦，並由香港藝術館與藝發局聯合籌劃。展覽將於二○二六年五月九日至十一月二十二日在意大利威尼斯卡斯泰洛區Campo della Tana, 2126, 30122舉行。

Arrangements for registered Chinese medicine practitioners referring patients to services provided by allied health professionals take effect,2025-12-11 15:01,2025-12-11 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100449.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong:

The Supplementary Medical Professions (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 took effect on July 25, 2025. It renamed the Supplementary Medical Professions Ordinance (Cap. 359 of the Laws of Hong Kong) as the Allied Health Professions Ordinance and made various amendments to the Ordinance, including providing the legal basis for specified allied health professionals to accept referrals from registered Chinese medicine practitioners (RCMPs). To implement the specific arrangements of such referrals, the Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (CMP Board) of the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong promulgated today (December 11) the Guidelines for Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners Referring Patients for Diagnostic Imaging and Laboratory Tests (Referral Guidelines) and revised the Code of Professional Conduct for Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners in Hong Kong (RCMP Code of Conduct). Through establishing clear professional competency requirements and referral principles, the Referral Guidelines and revised RCMP Code of Conduct ensure that RCMPs possess the necessary professional knowledge and skills when making referrals, thereby safeguarding patient safety, further promoting interprofessional collaboration in an orderly manner and enhancing healthcare quality.

RCMPs' referral of patients for diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Chinese medicine sector has been exploring how Chinese medicine practitioners can directly utilise modern diagnostic methods to assist in making more accurate diagnoses to serve the practical needs of the Chinese medicine profession while aligning with the best medical interests of patients. For this purpose, the CMP Board established the Medical Referral Working Group in December 2023 to conduct a study on the professional standards required, establish reference standards and guidelines, and propose amendments to the RCMP Code of Conduct. After extensive consultation with various stakeholders (including RCMPs and relevant medical professions and organisations), the CMP Board and its Medical Referral Working Group promulgated today the Referral Guidelines and revised the RCMP Code of Conduct to provide clearer guidance for RCMPs in making such referrals.

The Referral Guidelines set out the basic principles, professional responsibilities, and the necessary knowledge and skills required for RCMPs to refer patients for diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests. RCMPs arranging such referrals must ensure they have met the requirements on professional knowledge and competencies outlined in the Referral Guidelines and followed the practice rules stipulated in the Referral Guidelines when making and managing such referrals.

To safeguard patient safety and best interests, a step-by-step approach will be adopted for implementing the Referral Guidelines. Currently, the Referral Guidelines only apply to referrals for plain X-rays, while the Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) will serve as a pilot site, in which RCMPs, when working as members of an attending clinical care team, may refer patients of the hospital to radiographers and/or medical laboratory technologists within the hospital's clinical care team for other test items in accordance with the hospital's internal clinical guidelines. The CMP Board expects that the experience obtained through this pilot arrangement at the CMHHK will facilitate future interprofessional discussions to progressively include other commonly used diagnostic imaging and laboratory test items into the Referral Guidelines.

RCMPs' referral of patients for physiotherapist and occupational therapist services
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, the Ordinance allows physiotherapists and occupational therapists to accept referrals from RCMPs. To this end, the CMP Board is consulting the RCMP and other relevant medical professional sectors on the draft Guidelines for Registered Chinese Medicine Practitioners Referring Patients for Services Provided by Healthcare Professionals, with a view to providing more specific guidance on the basic principles, professional responsibilities, and required professional knowledge and skills involved in such referrals to promote interprofessional collaboration in the long term.

To support the above development, the CMP Board has been closely communicating with the Supplementary Medical Professions Council (SMP Council) and noted that the SMP Council has endorsed the codes of practice for radiographers, medical laboratory technologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, enabling them to accept RCMPs' referral for allied health services, with the revisions also taking effect today (December 11). The CMP Board and the SMP Council will continue to strengthen collaboration on matters relating to RCMPs' referral for allied health services with a view to promoting the development of interprofessional collaboration."

註冊中醫轉介病人接受診斷成像檢測及化驗檢查
—————————————————————
中醫業界多年來一直積極探討中醫師可更直接透過現代診斷方法以助作出更精確的診斷，以配合中醫專業的執業需要及切合病人最佳醫療利益。為此，中醫組於二○二三年十二月成立醫療轉介工作小組，為轉介所需的專業水平進行研究，以制訂參考標準及指引，並為《註冊中醫守則》提出修訂建議。中醫組及其醫療轉介工作小組經廣泛諮詢各界意見（包括註冊中醫以及相關醫療專業及團體）後，於今日頒布《轉介指引》及經修訂的《註冊中醫守則》，為註冊中醫進行有關轉介提供更清晰的指引。

《轉介指引》列出註冊中醫轉介病人接受診斷成像檢測及化驗檢查的基本原則、專業責任，以及所需的專業知識和技能等。安排有關轉介的註冊中醫須符合《轉介指引》所列明的專業知識和能力要求，並必須按《轉介指引》列出的業務規範作出和處理轉介。

為保障病人的安全及最佳利益，《轉介指引》將以循序漸進方式實施。現時《轉介指引》只適用於X光平片檢查，並會以香港中醫醫院作為試點，容許註冊中醫在該院擔任病人主診臨床團隊成員時，按該院內部的臨床指引轉介該院病人予醫院臨床團隊內的放射技師及／或醫務化驗師接受其他檢查項目。中醫組期望透過香港中醫醫院先行先試累積的經驗，協助日後的跨專業討論，以逐步加入其他常用診斷成像檢測和化驗檢查項目。

Large-scale international aviation exhibition and conferences conclude in Hong Kong (with photos),2025-12-11 14:52,2025-12-11 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100218.htm,"  Hong Kong marked a significant milestone in regional aviation by holding two large-scale international exhibition and conferences, the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO) Asia Pacific Conference 2025 and the Airspace Asia Pacific 2025.

  The Director-General of Civil Aviation, Mr Victor Liu, said that holding these important international meetings in Hong Kong had demonstrated Hong Kong's status as an international aviation hub. The Civil Aviation Department (CAD) has actively participated in and supported these international aviation meetings hosted by CANSO, and will continue to collaborate with international aviation partners and stakeholders to enhance the development of air traffic management and low-altitude traffic management.

  The Airspace Asia Pacific 2025 was held for three days at AsiaWorld-Expo, and concluded today (December 11). Being the first Asia-Pacific exhibition and conference under the Airspace World, the event, themed ""Shaping the Future of Asia Pacific's Skies"", has brought together over 2 000 decision-makers from air navigation service providers, professionals, regulatory bodies, and innovative technology companies from around the world, collectively driving global air traffic into a new era of digitisation and intelligence.

  Key guests officiating at the opening ceremony included the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan; the President and Chief Executive Officer of CANSO, Mr Simon Hocquard; the Deputy Administrator of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), Mr Ma Bing; the Director-General of the Air Traffic Management Bureau (ATMB) of the CAAC, Mr Miao Xuan; Mr Liu and theRegional Director of the Asia Pacific Office of theInternational Civil Aviation Organization, Mr Ma Tao. Before the start of the conference, all participants stood and observeda moment of silence to mourn the victims of the Tai Po fire.

  The exhibition and conference featured multiple keynote sessions and panel discussions focusing on exploring the most significant challenges and opportunities in air traffic management. Topics covered the low-altitude economy, green aviation, AI and climate challenges, etc. The event also attracted over 70 exhibitors presenting cutting-edge technologies in air traffic management, low-altitude traffic management, AI applications, and emerging aviation technologies, driving the industry towards a sustainable future with digitalisation and automation, thus creating a safe, seamless, and green airspace.

  Mr Liu was also invited to deliver an opening speech at the CANSO Asia Pacific Conference 2025 on December 8. Echoing the theme of ""Seamless Asia Pacific Airspace - Aviation and Meteorology Integration"" this year, Mr Liu shared how Hong Kong utilises meteorological data to respond to severe and unpredictable climate changes to ensure aviation safety.

  During the event, Mr Liu also met with a number of delegates, including the Director-General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Mr Han Kok-juan; the Counsellor for Civil Aviation, Aviation Industry and Space from the Embassy of France in China, Mrs Marion Okunowski; the Director General of the EUROCONTROL, Mr Raúl Medina; and the Chief Executive Officer of National Air Traffic Services, Mr Martin Rolfe, to exchange views on issues of mutual concern.

  The CAD also took the opportunity to invite the CAAC delegation, including Mr Ma Bing, Mr Miao, and the Director-General of the Central and Southern Regional Administration of the CAAC, Mr Li Shuangchen, to attend the sharing session themed ""Quest for dreams, Pay tribute to the era"", jointly organised by the Central and Southern Regional Administration and theATMB of the CAAC, and the CAD. Representatives of young civil aviation practitioners from the Mainland, Hong Kong, and Macao shared their experiences and insights from the exchange programme.

The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong commences operations today and increases quota for subsidised general outpatient services in first month to meet keen demand (with photos/video),2025-12-11 14:42,2025-12-11 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100320.htm,"  The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) commenced operations in phases today (December 11), offering outpatient and day-patient services, fully launching six specialised Chinese medicine (CM) services, along with 12 special disease programmes in the first year. In response to the keen public demand for government-subsidised outpatient services, the hospital will increase the quota for the members of the public to book government-subsidised general outpatient services in the first month after the service commencement.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""The service commencement of CMHHK marks a significant milestone in the development of CM in our city, signifying the progression of Hong Kong's CM to go beyond primary healthcare and play a part in secondary and tertiary healthcare services. I look forward to CMHHK providing more comprehensive CM services to the members of the public, and developing a 'Hong Kong model' for pure CM, services with CM playing the predominant role and integrated Chinese-Western medicine (ICWM) services. It will also dovetail with the upcoming CM Development Blueprint to be announced by the Government, to foster a high-quality and high-standard development of CM on all fronts, thereby providing powerful impetus for CM to go global.""

  CMHHK began accepting appointments last month. In view of the overwhelming response, the quota for government-subsidised general outpatient services in the first month is already full. Professor Lo said, ""In response to the keen public demand, we have requested the hospital to increase the quota for government-subsidised general outpatient services in the first month after service commencement for members of the public to make appointments. Specifically, the service quota in the first 10 days of operation has been doubled. For the remaining days of the first month upon service commencement, the service quota has also been increased by an additional 30 per cent starting today. Apart from subsidised outpatient services, patients may also make appointments for the non-subsidised outpatient clinic, where they can select their preferred CM practitioners.""

  Today, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of CMHHK Operator, Mr Wong Kwai-huen, accompanied by the Hospital Chief Executive of CMHHK, Professor Bian Zhaoxiang, inspected the hospital's first day of operation which was generally smooth.

  In the first year, the hospital will provide outpatient and day-patient services and fully launch six specialised CM services, namely Internal Medicine in CM, External Medicine in CM, Gynaecology in CM, Paediatrics in CM, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in CM, and Acupuncture and Moxibustion in CM. It will also provide 12 special disease programmes, including those for elderly degenerative diseases and stroke rehabilitation. The services of CMHHK will feature four highlights: (i) adhering to the principle of ""pursuing specialty in specialised CM services and exceling in special disease programmes"", the hospital will pool talent, experience, knowledge and techniques to focus on the development of key areas where CM has distinct advantages, offering effective treatment outcomes for members of the public; (ii) actively develop an ICWM service model, combining the strengths of both Chinese and Western medicines to formulate treatment plans, supplemented by multidisciplinary healthcare teams, thereby providing comprehensive and optimal clinical support for patients; (iii) bring together an elite team of Hong Kong, Mainland, and international CM expert teams across multiple disciplines at the hospital to participate in short-term services, training, and research, leveraging their outstanding capabilities to provide services to members of the public; and (iv) uphold the traditional CM philosophy of ""treatment based on pattern differentiation"". Through providing wholehearted services together with professional and precise analysis, the hospital will tailor-make personalised care services for patients to resolve their health problems.To demonstrate the Government's commitment to public health, 65 per cent of the hospital's total service volume are Government-subsidised services. The hospital will also provide market-oriented services to foster positive interaction between the hospital and private market. Members of the public can visit the hospital website (www.cmhhk.org.hk) for more information on the hospital services.

  Apart from the hospital hotline (3121 3121) and website, members of the public can also make appointments through the newly launched ""CMHHK Mobile App"". After downloading the app and completing registration with basic personal information, users can make appointments at either the government-subsidised outpatient clinic or the non-subsidised outpatient clinic. For those seeking appointments at the Specialised Clinic, patients can first make an appointment at the General Clinic for an initial assessment, or they can directly upload a referral letter from a registered CM practitioner, medical practitioner, or other registered healthcare professional (such as nurses, pharmacists and allied health professionals).

  In addition, CMHHK will provide medical fee waivers to the victims of the Tai Po Wang Fuk Court fire. All residents of the eight blocks at Wang Fuk Court (including foreign domestic helpers) and all individuals injured in the fire and admitted to public hospitals under the Hospital Authority will receive full fee waivers at CMHHK until December 31, 2026, covering all government-subsidised services, including General Clinic, Specialised Clinic, Allied Health Services, day-patient services, as well as special Western medicine diagnostic procedures and medications (discharge medication collection). Relevant individuals can identify themselves to the hospital and provide basic personal information (including name, identity card number and residential address) during consultations to facilitate the arrangement.

  To facilitate public access, CMHHK will provide free shuttle services between Tiu Keng Leng MTR Station, LOHAS Park Station, and the hospital's main entrance. The Transport Department has co-ordinated with public transport operators to enhance services to the hospital area, including a new minibus route 116H connecting Tseung Kwan O Station and the hospital's main entrance. Also, eight franchised bus routes and one green minibus route will add stops on Pak Shing Kok Road, Tseung Kwan O, with the hospital accessible after a short walk from these stops.

  CMHHK will hold open days on January 17 and 18, 2026, for the public to better understand the hospital's services and mode of operation. Reservations can be made online through the hospital's websitestarting today.

  Located at 1 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, CMHHK adopts a public-private partnership model with its construction fully funded by the Government. Hong Kong Baptist University was selected as the contractor through tendering procedures in 2021 and it subsequently incorporated a company limited by guarantee in the same year in accordance with the service deed to act as the operator for managing, operating, and maintaining the hospital."

Speech by SFST at HKQAA Green and Sustainable Finance Forum Luncheon 2025 (English only),2025-12-11 12:56,2025-12-11 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100356.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the HKQAA Green and Sustainable Finance Forum Luncheon 2025 today (December 11):

Simon (Chairman of the Hong Kong Quality Assurance Agency (HKQAA), Professor Wong Ka-wo), Professor Sun (Deputy Secretary of the CPC Xi'an Jiaotong University Committee, Professor Sun Zao) distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is a great honour and pleasure for me to join you today at the HKQAA Green and Sustainable Finance Forum Luncheon 2025. I am very delighted to be here among such a distinguished gathering of industry leaders, experts, and stakeholders committed to advancing sustainable development. Let me begin by acknowledging the excellent theme curated by the HKQAA for this forum: ""Fostering the Development of Sustainable Finance and Technology, Promoting Climate Risk and ESG Disclosure"". This theme is timely and relevant amid global challenges including climate change and environmental conservation, emphasising innovative solutions for economic resilience and planetary protection.

 I must also take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the outstanding work that the HKQAA has accomplished in the realm of sustainable finance and beyond. The HKQAA has actively participated in shaping international standards for green finance. This agency has launched the Green and Sustainable Finance Certification Scheme, providing credible verification for issuers and building trust in the market. Your support for Hong Kong's sustainability disclosure roadmap is equally commendable, exemplified by the development of pioneering industry-based technical guidance on climate disclosure. This guidance represents one of the initial global efforts in this area, highlighting Hong Kong's strengths and leadership in sustainability reporting.

 Furthermore, the HKQAA's initiatives in capacity building, such as offering workshops and digital tools like the GHG (greenhouse gas) Scope 3 Emission Calculator, have been instrumental in preparing the business community for enhanced climate disclosures. All these tools empower companies to measure and manage their environmental impact effectively. In the domain of carbon markets and low-carbon ecosystems, the HKQAA has introduced innovative initiatives in carbon inclusion, event carbon offsetting, and low-carbon transportation infrastructure. These efforts not only support the growth of carbon trading but also contribute to building a comprehensive low-carbon ecosystem.

 Turning to the broader landscape, the Central People's Government has outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan a commitment to green transformation, aiming to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve neutrality before 2060. Hong Kong aligns with these goals, targeting carbon neutrality before 2050 and a 50 per cent emissions reduction before 2035. Globally, climate finance reached US$1.3 trillion in 2021/22, but is estimated to hit US$9 trillion annually by 2030 and US$10 trillion by 2050. This highlights the demand for green finance, where Hong Kong plays a key role in capital mobilisation.

 As a premier international financial centre, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned as a ""super connector"" linking the Chinese Mainland with global markets. We leverage robust regulatory frameworks, expertise in standards, and connectivity to global capital. Last year, green and sustainable debt issued here exceeded US$84 billion, with bonds at US$43 billion - capturing 45 per cent of Asia's total, ranking first for seven years since 2018. This success stems from comprehensive government policies working together with the industry, of course also with the HKQAA, to foster green finance, technology integration, and of course disclosure efforts, as highlighted by the theme of this forum.

 The Government has been taking the lead to promote green finance. Under the Government Sustainable Bond Programme, we have issued bonds totalling about HK$250 billion equivalent since 2019. Notable issuances include two batches of retail green bonds of HK$20 billion each in 2022 and 2023 - the 2022 issuance being the largest retail green bond globally at the time. At the same time, we have multicurrency green bonds in RMB (Renminbi), USD (US dollars), and euro totalling around HK$45 billion equivalent in 2023, marking the largest ESG (environmental, social and governance) bond issuance in Asia; and innovative tokenised green bonds, including the world's first multitranche digitally native green bonds last year and a HK$10 billion equivalent issuance last month that integrated tokenised central bank money like e-CNY and e-HKD for settlement.

 To incentivise market participation, the Government launched the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme in 2021 to provide subsidy for eligible bond issuers and loan borrowers to cover part of their expenses on bond issuance and external review services. The Scheme has been extended by three years from 2024 to 2027, with an expanded scope of subsidies to cover transition bonds and loans. These measures encourage relevant industries in the region to make use of Hong Kong's transition financing platform towards decarbonisation. As of end-November this year, we have granted around HK$410 million to over 640 green and sustainable debt instruments issued in Hong Kong, involving a total underlying debt issuance of over HK$1.3 trillion.

 Innovation is at the heart of our strategy, particularly in green fintech. The Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group, co-chaired by regulators, launched the Hong Kong Green Fintech Map 2025 in June this year, developed with stakeholders like Cyberport and Invest Hong Kong. This map provides one-stop information on green fintech companies in Hong Kong, enhancing their visibility. And in June last year, we introduced the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme, approving 39 applicants for 60 projects with HK$150,000 grants each to foster commercialisation.

 On sustainability disclosure, my bureau FSTB (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau) launched in December last year the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong. The roadmap sets out Hong Kong's approach to require publicly accountable entities (PAEs), which are essentially our listing companies, to adopt the ISSB Standards (International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards). It provides a well-defined pathway for large PAEs to fully adopt the ISSB Standards no later than 2028. In June this year, the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS Foundation) published the jurisdictional profiles on adoption of the ISSB Standards and Hong Kong was confirmed as among the initial set of jurisdictions having set a target of fully adopting the ISSB Standards. This demonstrates Hong Kong's commitment to enhancing the transparency of information on sustainable development in the capital markets, facilitating investors to make investment decisions and promoting global capital flows. My bureau in collaboration with financial regulators and stakeholders will continue to support the pragmatic implementation of the Hong Kong Standards through enhancing capacity building and promoting the use of technological solutions.

 Another key topic is about carbon markets, we are extending our efforts to build Hong Kong into an international credible market to connect opportunities across the Mainland, Asia and the rest of the world. The Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) launched an international carbon marketplace Core Climate in October 2022, which is currently the only carbon marketplace that offers HKD (Hong Kong dollars) and RMB settlement for the trading of international voluntary carbon credits. The number of participants on the platform reached 100 by the end of last year. The HKEX signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in September this year with Guangzhou Emissions Exchange, Shenzhen Green Exchange and Macao International Carbon Emission Exchange to co-operate in accelerating the carbon markets and green finance ecosystem development across the Greater Bay Area. Under the MOU, the four exchanges will work closely to explore new opportunities in carbon markets and green finance. This collaboration aims to foster deeper dialogue and facilitate the exchange of expertise among the exchanges and markets participants, supporting the development of a robust and vibrant green finance ecosystem across Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.

 Looking forward, Hong Kong's leadership in sustainable finance requires unwavering commitment, innovation, and collaboration. This forum, with insights from a lineup of distinguished speakers, will provide visionary perspectives helping us to drive further development. Through partnerships with all stakeholders, we will continue to unlock capital for a greener future, extending beyond Hong Kong to Asia and globally. Thank you once again for having me today and at the same time, to the HKQAA for organising this event. I wish the forum every success and look forward to fruitful discussions and more insights to inform us to make better decisions going forward.

 Thank you."
文化體育及旅遊局局長在體育爭議解決先導計劃啓動禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-12-11 12:38,2025-12-11 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100307.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（十二月十一日）在體育爭議解決先導計劃啓動禮的致辭：

尊敬的劉春華部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室法律部部長）、張國鈞副司長（律政司副司長兼體育爭議解決諮詢委員會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位運動員、各位朋友：

大家早上好。今日與各位在香港體育的新地標——啟德體育園，一同見證體育爭議解決先導計劃（先導計劃）正式啓動，實在別有意義。首先，我衷心感謝各位蒞臨啟德體育園支持，共同為香港體育的發展揭開新一頁。

體育強則國家強，國運興則體育興。體育是國家綜合實力的重要體現，更是凝聚人心、促進社會進步的重要力量。特區政府一直十分重視香港的體育發展，致力從普及化、精英化、盛事化、專業化及產業化五個方向推動體育發展，並投入了龐大的資源。在二○二五至二○二六年度，我們投放於體育發展的預算約92億港元，較十年前約43億港元的預算，增幅超過一倍。除了資源投放，我們亦從設施建設、人才培訓及盛事籌辦多方面着手，為促進香港體育發展創造更加有利的環境。

剛過去的第十五屆全國運動會當中，香港運動員創下歷史性的驕人成績，勇奪9金、2銀、8銅，一共19面獎牌。這份成就不僅是基於運動員的努力，亦是所有市民共同的驕傲。

隨着香港體育發展日益蓬勃，體育產業朝專業化、產業化的方向邁進，體育領域的合作日趨頻繁，過程中有一些爭議也確實難避免。這些爭議的範疇可以非常廣泛，常見的可能涉及運動員參賽資格、選拔事宜、賽事門票、賽事贊助、廣播權、機構管治等問題。有一些涉及運動員的爭議，有可能對他們的職業生涯造成重大影響。因此，建立一套切合業界需要和有效化解糾紛的機制，對於體育發展至為重要。

文化體育及旅遊局全力支持律政司、法律界及體育界共同推動體育爭議解決先導計劃，目標是在建立一套中立、公平、高效的體育制度機制，妥善處理各類體育相關糾紛，保障運動員、教練、體育組織及所有持份者的合法權益。

我們深知，體育專業化發展需要社會各界同心協力。體育爭議解決先導計劃正為香港體育界提供了重要支援，不單能回應當前業界的實際需要，更加有助營造更健康、可持續的發展環境，為香港體育的長遠未來奠定穩固基礎。多個香港體育界的主要機構及人士，包括中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會、香港體育學院、各個體育總會、教練和運動員在成立先導計劃亦有參與其中，提出多項寶貴意見，我謹此向各個單位衷心致謝。

我亦希望借今日的活動提醒大家，全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會，即殘特奧會，今個星期正在香港進行中，我希望大家一同繼續支持和見證運動員在香港主場再創佳績。

最後，我祝願體育爭議解決先導計劃順利推進，香港體育事業繼續邁向高峰。

多謝各位。"

尊敬的劉春華部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室法律部部長）、羅淑佩局長（文化體育及旅遊局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

首先，我謹代表香港律政司，以及兩個合辦機構——亞非法協香港區域仲裁中心和一邦國際網上仲調中心，歡迎各位出席今日體育爭議解決先導計劃的啓動禮。

香港是一個充滿活力的城市，在社會的每一個環節、每一個角落，大家都會感受到香港人的朝氣和拼勁，而體育運動更已經成為香港人生活中不可或缺的一部分。在剛成功舉行的十五運會（第十五屆全國運動會），以及正在進行的殘特奧會（全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會），都充分展現了香港運動員的出色表現和香港全城的投入和支持。香港人熱愛運動，大家每日早晚都會見到不少市民跑步健身，球場和體育館設施總是不敷應用，當然我們亦看到一些新興運動在香港遍地開花，例如近來興起的棍網球和匹克球，而每年的香港馬拉松和七人欖球更早已成為國際體育盛事。所以，體育不僅是個人身心鍛鍊的好方法，更是凝聚社會的黏合劑，促進社會團結，推動社會向前發展。

當然，啟德體育園的啓用，亦為本地體育發展注入強大動力，讓香港體育發展進入新台階。而隨着體育產業蓬勃發展，各持分者之間互動難免會出現體育爭議。因此，設立專門解決體育爭議的機制，是我們推動體育產業升上更高台階的重要體育基礎建設。大家都知道，運動員比賽生涯的黃金時期是有限的，若因為爭議或糾紛而影響了訓練，甚至令他們錯過了重要的體育賽事，這不只是運動員的遺憾，更會是整個社會的重大損失。所以，建立一個高效且具公信力的爭議解決制度，對推動香港體育專業發展的確非常關鍵。

放眼全球，體育爭議解決領域發展可以說是非常蓬勃。總部設於瑞士的國際體育仲裁院是被公認為處理體育爭議的主要國際機構，建立了完善的仲裁及調解制度；馬來西亞的亞洲國際仲裁中心近年亦推出專為體育爭議而設的《亞洲體育仲裁規則》；中國內地依據經修訂的《中華人民共和國體育法》成立中國體育仲裁委員會，亦為建立完善的體育糾紛解決體系奠定基礎。這些經驗為香港提供了非常寶貴的參考。

當然，香港憑藉「一國兩制」的獨特優勢、穩健的法律制度、世界知名的專業機構及人才，以及獨立公正的司法制度，一直是亞太區領先的國際法律及爭議解決服務中心。國際調解院最近亦已經落戶香港，成為全球首個專門以調解方式解決國際爭議的政府間法律機構，進一步鞏固香港作為和平爭議解決中心的地位。香港優越的地理位置與多元的語言文化環境，亦使其成為連接中外的橋樑，為香港發展成為本地、區域乃至國際體育爭議解決樞紐奠定基礎。

過去兩年，律政司與體育界、法律界緊密合作，推出體育爭議解決先導計劃，作為《施政報告》中的其中一個重點措施。先導計劃提供了一個公平、高效、便捷的制度，透過調解與仲裁處理體育糾紛，促進體育產業能夠在一個公平的市場中自由競爭發展。與此同時，運動員可透過及時、公平的機制解決困難，消除顧慮，從而讓他們更安心和專注訓練和比賽；體育機構和組織則能受惠於具成本效益及中立的解決程序，得以健康持續發展。當然，特區政府亦會為合資格的案件提供資助，讓有需要的人士能透過計劃，尋求公義。

律政司年初成立由文化體育及旅遊局、香港大律師公會及香港律師會的代表組成的體育爭議解決諮詢委員會，並於六月公開邀請爭議解決機構提交建議書。委員會其後按照機構基礎設施、專業知識、管治質素、利益衝突管理機制、推廣及培訓網絡與經驗，以及合理收費承諾等評審準則，嚴格審核所有建議書，最終分別由亞非法協香港區域仲裁中心和一邦國際網上仲調中心獲選為先導計劃的管理機構及科技服務供應商。管理機構將負責管理先導計劃，以及就調解及仲裁提供機構支援；而科技服務供應商則負責提供營辦先導計劃所需的科技基建及支援；推動法律科技及網上爭議解決服務。在隨後的討論環節，我們邀請了不同講者深入探討調解與仲裁在解決體育爭議方面的優勢，並介紹先導計劃的特點。

先導計劃除了服務體育界，更着重培養理解與和平爭議解決的文化。律政司將會繼續與法律界及體育業界攜手，舉辦更多推廣及培訓活動。透過這些舉措，我們期望能夠進一步提升公眾對體育爭議解決的認識，使先導計劃發揮其最大效用。

我鼓勵在座來自不同專業領域的朋友，積極參與各類與體育爭議解決相關的培訓活動，甚或考慮接受培訓成為體育調解員或仲裁員，將自身在體育、法律等領域的知識和經驗，融入體育爭議解決的工作中，為香港的體育發展及爭議解決事業作出貢獻。

各位，讓我們今日一起出發，攜手推動香港成為亞洲以至國際體育爭議解決中心。多謝大家。"

Participating organisations in the initial stage include Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui Welfare Council, the Comfort Care Concern Group, and the Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong.

Dovetailing with the ""one social worker per household"" service of the Social Welfare Department, the programme provides free mental health support services, including grief and bereavement counselling for the bereaved, and refers them to clinical psychologists and/or psychiatrists for follow-up services as required based on mental health risk assessments, with a view to accompanying them through the pain of loss. Participating organisations will actively reach out to the bereaved families to provide services. The Primary Healthcare Commission can also refer affected families to join the programme through the District Health Centres in all 18 districts in Hong Kong.

In addition, the Hospital Authority will train the staff of the relevant social service organisations by enhancing their knowledge of and skills in responding to reactions and stress brought about by disasters.

The Chairman of the ACMH, Dr Lam Ching-choi, said, ""We fully understand the profound pain and loss caused by the disaster. The Compassionate Support Programme for Bereaved Families will pool strengths from different sectors to provide psychological support for bereaved families affected by the disaster in a timely manner and to journey with them through this difficult time.""

Dr Lam also visited the Lok Sin Village transitional housing project in Tai Po operated by the Lok Sin Tong Benevolent Society, Kowloon, yesterday (December 10) to learn more about the living environment, facilities and support available to the victims of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, who have been rehoused there on a temporary basis."

The case involved a structure with an area of about 20 square metres on the roof of a composite building at Fuk Tsun Street, Tai Kok Tsui. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (December 11), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Adjustment of Base Rate,2025-12-11 08:21,2025-12-11 08:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100176.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced today (December 11) that the Base Rate has been set at 4.00 per cent with immediate effect according to a pre-set formula.

The Base Rate is the interest rate forming the foundation upon which the Discount Rates for repurchase transactions through the Discount Window are computed. The Base Rate is currently set at either 50 basis points above the lower end of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.

Following the 25-basis point downward adjustment in the target range for the US federal funds rate on December10 (US time), 50 basis points above the lower end of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate is 4.00 per cent, while the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs is 2.39 per cent. The Base Rate is therefore set at 4.00 per cent according to the pre-set formula."

Hospital Authority's statement regarding calibration certificate for vibration sensor used in hospital redevelopment and expansion projects,2025-12-10 23:26,2025-12-10 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000866.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) issued the following statement today (December 10) regarding the calibration certificate for vibration sensor used in hospital redevelopment and expansion projects:

The HA yesterday (December 9) reported to the police a suspected case of forged calibration certificate for vibration sensor for further investigation. A subcontractor named Novox Limited (Novox) submitted the calibration certificate to the main contractor, China Railway Construction Group Co.,Ltd (CRCC), for the expansion project of the Lai King Building in Princess Margaret Hospital (LKB). And the certificate was submitted to HA through the main contractor. Subsequent verification by the HA confirmed that the calibration certificate was not issued by the Guangdong Zhongzhenghang Metrology Testing Co., Ltd as listed on the certificate.

The HA takes this matter very seriously thus actively reporting to the Police. The HA has also instructed the main contractor to rigorously follow up and thoroughly investigate the incident. The HA has also requested the main contractor to suspend the work of the subcontractor, Novox Limited (Novox) and the HA reserves all rights to pursue legal action against any breach of hospital construction contract.

Vibration sensors are installed at hospital redevelopment and expansion sites to ensure that vibrations generated by construction works do not affect hospital operations and medical services. Apart from installing vibration sensors at hospital construction sites, the project team will also deploy portable instruments for manual monitoring where necessary. The vibration sensors are generally calibrated annually by the contractor to ensure the accuracy of the monitoring data. The contractor is also required to provide a certificate after the calibration.

The spokesperson for the HA emphasized, ""These monitoring instruments serve a precautionary purpose. In parallel, the main contractor also use portable instruments for manual monitoring. We are also closely monitoring the feedbacks by our stakeholders. Should any healthcare staff report any service disturbance from the construction work, regardless of whether the vibration levels exceed specified limits, the hospital will prioritize patient safety and medical services by immediately suspending the relevant construction work. Over the past six months, the HA has not received any reports of medical services being suspended due to vibrations caused by hospital construction.""

The spokesperson added that the HA has conducted a preliminary assessment of the incident that there was no impact on medical services nor patient safety.

The HA is highly committed to ensuring the safety and management of hospital construction projects. All hospital construction contracts specify reference levels for acceptable vibration levels to ensure the impact of construction on hospital operations and medical services is minimized. The HA will investigate the relevant projects comprehensively, to verify all surveillance data and the process of data upload. The HA also strictly requires contractors to implement measures ensuring all works comply with relevant regulations. Regular inspections by the construction consultants are conducted to monitor contractors' adherence to the requirements and verify compliance standards.

Novox was a subcontractor of vibration monitoring hired by the main contractors in various hospital redevelopment and expansion projects (including the LKB expansion project), whereas BEWIS Sensing Technology LLC (BEWIS) was the subcontractor of Novox in vibration sensor supply and equipment calibration.

On October 27, HA received notification from BEWIS stating that the contractual relationship with Novox has already been terminated. After redeiving such information, the HA immediately inquired the main contractors of all relevant hospital construction projects, requiring them to ensure that all projects remain unaffected. The HA also instructed the construction consultants and main contractors to reassess the performance of projects undertaken by Novox. Main contractors were reminded to strengthen supervision to ensure project quality meets standards and contractual requirements. The HA has also required all main contractors to commission accredited testing centers to recalibrate vibration sensors and submit certificates.

OnNovember 15, the HA subsequently received five calibration certificates by Novox from the main contractor of LKB. Among all, four of the calibration were conducted on October 28, 2025, while the remaing one was conducted on November25, 2024. Meanwhile, the HA received a relevant enquiry from HK01 on November 18. For the sake of prudency, the HA particularly tried to verify the authenticity of the certificate with the accredited testing centers. On December 8, the HA received notification through CRCC that the relevant authority had not issued such calibration certificate and suspected that the document was forged.

Currently, apart from the LKB, Novox has also undertaken vibration monitoring projects for other hospitals, including Kwong Wah Hospital, Our Lady of Maryknoll Hospital, Grantham Hospital, and North District Hospital. Novox has also been appointed by various main contractors on real time noise and vibration monitoring system and the online monitoring platform, as well as noise and dust meters. In view of the abovementioned incidents, the HA will comprehensively review and trace all hospital construction projects and services commissioned by Novox, and the certificates submitted by Novox. The HA has zero tolerance on fraudulence. If any fraudulent activity is discovered, the matter will definitely be referred to the police for further investigation and damages will be claimed."

Regulation and inspection work
----------------------------------

Upon liaison with the Police, the Housing Department will start removing the burnt scaffolding on the external walls of Wang Cheong House, Wang Tai House and Wang Sun House this Friday (December 12).

醫院管理局就醫院重建及擴建工程監測震動儀器校正證明的聲明,2025-12-10 21:46,2025-12-10 22:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000735.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（十二月十日）就醫院重建及擴建工程的監測震動儀器校正證明作出以下聲明︰

醫管局昨日（十二月九日）向警方報告一宗懷疑偽造監測震動儀器校正證明的事件，交由警方作進一步調查。有關儀器校正證明由瑪嘉烈醫院荔景大樓擴建工程總承建商轄下一個分判商諾和工程公司呈交總承建商中鐵建設集團有限公司，再經總承建商呈交醫管局。其後經醫管局核查確認，該校正證明並非由證明書上所列的廣東中正航計量檢測有限公司所發出。

醫管局非常重視事件，已主動向警方報案，以及責成工程總承建商嚴肅跟進及徹查事件，並已要求總承建商暫停有關分判商諾和工程公司的工作。醫管局對違反醫院工程合約條款保留一切法律追究權利。

醫院在進行重建或擴建工程期間，會採取不同的措施監測震動的情況，以確保醫院工程所產生的震動不會對醫院運作及醫療服務構成影響。除在醫院工程地盤裝設監測震動儀器外，在有需要時亦會安排工程人員以手提儀器作監測。有關監測震動儀器一般會由承建商每年校正一次，確保監測數據準確無誤，承建商在校正後亦需提供認可的儀器校正證明。

醫管局發言人強調︰「有關監測震動儀器屬於預防性質，總承建商現時仍然會以手提儀器作監測。與此同時，我們亦會密切監察醫院工程附近使用者的反饋。如有醫護人員反映工程產生的震動影響服務，不論震動幅度有否超出規定，醫院均會以病人安全及醫療服務作為首要考慮，立即暫停有關工程。過去半年，醫管局沒有接獲任何醫院工程因為產生震動而需要暫停醫療服務的報告。」

發言人補充，醫管局已初步評估事件，沒有對醫療服務及病人安全造成影響。

醫管局非常重視轄下醫院工程的安全及管理，所有醫院工程合約均有訂明工程造成震動可承受參考水平，以確保工程不會對醫院運作及醫療服務構成影響。本局並將全面調查有關工程，重新核實包括有關工程的監測數據，以至上載數據的過程等。本局亦有嚴格要求，規定承建商必須採取措施，確保所有工程符合相關規定。本局的工程顧問會定期巡查，監督所有承建商執行相關規定的情況，以及核實相關標準。

諾和工程公司是多個醫院重建及擴建工程（包括瑪嘉烈醫院荔景大樓擴建工程）總承建商的其中一個負責包括震動監測的分判商，而北微傳感科技則為諾和工程公司提供震動監測儀器及相關儀器校正服務的分判商。

醫管局先於十月二十七日接獲北微傳感科技通知，指稱北微傳感科技與諾和工程公司的合約關係已經終止。在收到有關資訊後，醫管局即向各相關醫院建造工程的總承建商查詢，要求所有總承建商確保工程項目不受影響。醫管局亦同時責成各工程顧問及總承建商再次審視諾和工程公司承辦項目的表現；同時提醒總承建商必須做好監督工作，確保工程項目的質素符合標準及合約要求。本局亦要求所有總承建商委託合資格的專業檢測中心校正震動監測儀器及提交證明。

本局其後於十一月十五日接獲瑪嘉烈醫院荔景大樓總承建商提交，諾和工程公司早前向該總承建商呈交的五份校正證明，其中四份校準日期為二○二五年十月二十八日及一份校準日期為二○二四年十一月二十五日。期間本局於十一月十八日接獲「香港01」相關的查詢。基於審慎考慮，本局與校正證明書上所列負責認證的檢測機構確認相關校正證明的真確性。本局在十二月八日收到總承建商提交有關測試機構的函件，指出該機構並沒有發出有關校正證明，懷疑文件為偽造。

現時除了瑪嘉烈醫院荔景大樓外，諾和工程公司亦有承接其他醫院的監測震動工程，包括廣華醫院、聖母醫院、葛量洪醫院及北區醫院。諾和工程公司同時亦受聘於不同的總承建商，提供實時噪音及震動監測以及上載資料系統，以及噪音及沙塵監測計量儀器。因應上述事件，本局將會徹底全面檢視及追查所有醫院工程中與諾和工程公司有關的工程和服務，以及至目前為止收到所有與諾和工程公司有關的檢測證書。本局對造假行為採取零容忍態度，一旦發現造假行為，必定會交由警方進一步調查以及追討相關損失。

DH recorded another local case of chikungunya fever involving Tsing Yi Nature Trails and advises public not to visit the area,2025-12-10 20:57,2025-12-10 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000713.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 10), the CHP has recorded one new local case of chikungunya fever (CF), involving a patient who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails during the incubation period. The Tsing Yi Nature Trails is currently closed until further notice. The relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails. To avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering the mosquito control operations, members of the public should not enter the area.

Latest case information
------------------------------
 The case involves a 40-year-old male living in Tuen Mun District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he developed joint pain and a fever on December 4 and 5 respectively, followed by rash on December 7. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Tuen Mun Hospital yesterday (December 9) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

 The patient had no travel history during the incubation period. The case is classified as local. He hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails with 11 persons on November 30, and reportedly suffered mosquitoe bites there. Other than that, the CHP found no overlap between his activities during the incubation period and the locations visited by earlier confirmed cases. The CHP considered that the patient likely contracted the infection while hiking near Tsing Yi Nature Trails on that day, and that there is an epidemiological linkage between this case and the recent local cases in Tsing Yi. His household contact and the 11 hiking companions are currently asymptomatic. The CHP has implemented prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to the household contacts concerned. If necessary, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

 Hong Kong has recorded a total of 79 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------------

Regarding some local cases of CF who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the CHP held an interdepartmental meeting with representatives from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), the Home Affairs Department, the Drainage Services Department (DSD), the Lands Department, and the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) on December 8, to further confirmed measures to strengthen mosquito prevention and control in the vicinity of the Tsing Yi Nature Trails.

The CHP continues to urge individuals not to visit the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). The CHP yesterday issued another letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department and Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


ââThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

â
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生署再錄得一宗涉及青衣自然徑的基孔肯雅熱本地個案　忠告市民暫時不要到青衣自然徑,2025-12-10 20:00,2025-12-10 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000668.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月十日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱本地個案，患者亦曾在潛伏期內到過青衣自然徑。該自然徑目前已暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門近期會在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心再次忠告市民不應擅進，以免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名40歲男子，住所位於屯門區。初步調查顯示，他於十二月四日及五日先後出現關節痛及發燒，十二月七日出現皮疹，昨日（十二月九日）到屯門醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

病人在潛伏期內不曾外遊，屬本地感染個案。他於十一月三十日曾與11人到青衣自然徑遠足，據病人表示，其間他曾被蚊叮咬。除此以外，中心未發現他在潛伏期內的其他活動地點與早前確診個案曾到訪的地點有重疊。中心認為病人較大機會是於青衣自然徑一帶遠足時受感染，與近期青衣的本地個案有流行病學關連。他的家居接觸者及11名當日一同遠足的人士暫時沒有出現病徵。中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為相關人士提供醫學監察及健康建議。如有需要，中心會安排化驗檢測。流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

本港今年累計錄得79宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應近期有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，中心與食物環境衞生署（食環署）、民政事務總署、渠務署、地政總署和土木工程拓展署代表於十二月八日舉行跨部門會議，敲定進一步在青衣自然徑一帶加強防控蚊患的措施。

中心繼續呼籲市民暫時不要到青衣自然徑，曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。中心已於昨日再次去信全港醫生及醫院，敦促他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

​
​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
CHP investigates food poisoning cluster,2025-12-10 19:55,2025-12-10 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000677.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (December 10) investigating a food poisoning cluster affecting 31 persons. The CHP reminded the public to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The affected individuals, including 20 males and 11 females aged between two and 75, attended a Chinese wedding banquet at the Grand Ballroom of the New World Millennium Hong Kong Hotel, located at 72 Mody Road in Tsim Sha Tsui, on December 6. They developed abdominal pain and diarrhoea about two to 27 hours after dining.

One affected person sought medical advice.None of the affected individuals required hospitalisation and they are currently in stable condition.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the affected persons consumed several common food items at the aforementioned premises, including suckling pigs. Officers of the CHP and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, including personnel of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) and the Environmental Hygiene Branch, conducted an investigation at the hotel. They inspected the food handling process and food hygiene. The CFS' field investigation revealed that the suckling pigs were prepared too early in advance, and may have been cross contaminated by raw food during storage. The suckling pigs were not thoroughly reheated either. The CFS instructed the hotel concerned to immediately stop serving the incriminated food items, clean and disinfect the premises, and provide food safety and environmental hygiene education to the staff. Food and environmental samples were collected for testing.

The investigation of the CHP and CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use undercooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

The department today (December 10) conducted a raid on a licensed fresh provision shop (FPS) in Sai Kung District, suspecting such malpractice.

During the operation, FEHD officers raided a licensed FPS at Yan King Road in Tseung Kwan O, and seized about 264 kilograms of suspected frozen beef and about 256kg of prepackaged frozen beef, which have been immediately marked and sealed for further investigation. Beef samples were also collected for the detection of preservatives. Prosecutions will be initiated should there be sufficient evidence. The licensee of the FPS is suspected of breaching the licensing conditions for the display and sale of frozen meat as fresh meat, and the FEHD is proceeding with the cancellation of the FPS's licence.

Prosecution was initiated against the licensee of the FPS for the dirty condition of the premises. Two verbal warnings were also given to the licensee for non-compliance with the relevant licensing conditions for failing to provide delivery notes for inspection and improper storage of frozen beef.

A spokesman for the FEHD said, ""The selling of chilled or frozen meat disguised as fresh meat breaches the licensing conditions and poses food safety risks. Such operations are unfair to other compliant businesses.""

The spokesman added, ""Anyone selling chilled or frozen meat without permission commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment on conviction. The FEHD will continue to conduct regular inspections at licensed FPSs and market meat stalls and will deal with complaints promptly. In detecting any irregularities, the department will carry out investigations promptly and take appropriate enforcement action. In addition, the FEHD also proactively investigates suspected violations from time to time and conducts surprise inspections and enforcement actions as necessary. If there is sufficient evidence, prosecutions will be initiated, and follow-up action will be taken against breaches of licensing conditions or tenancy agreements. The licences of those FPSs breaching licensing conditions may be cancelled, while the tenancies of market meat stalls breaching tenancy agreements may be terminated.""

The spokesman emphasised the FEHD's deep concern and strong commitment to combating the sale of chilled or frozen meat disguised as fresh meat through stringent enforcement actions."

They had exchanges with representatives from about 70 Mainland enterprises and industry associations to deepen the enterprises' understanding of the advantages of Hong Kong's professional services and promote Hong Kong to be their preferred platform for going global.

The exchange event was co-organised for the first time by the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the the Qianhai Authority of Shenzhen. This marked the second time Dr Cheung has led a cross-professional delegation for such direct exchanges with Mainland enterprises, following his visit to Guangzhou to meet with senior executives of Guangdong enterprises in June, to promote the role of Hong Kong's professional services in supporting Mainland enterprises to expand overseas.

Dr Cheung said that the 15th Five-Year Plan, focusing on high-quality development and expanding the scope of high-level opening up, presents Hong Kong with historic opportunities. Noting that Hong Kong's internationalised professional services perfectly complement the country's development needs, he encouraged the professional service sectors to seize the enormous business opportunities brought by Mainland enterprises in going global to create strong impetus for growth and achieve mutual benefits.

Dr Cheung mentioned that it is clearly stated in the 2025 Policy Address that Hong Kong should capitalise on its role as a platform for ""going global"" in which he is tasked to promote Hong Kong's legal services and to collaborate with other professional service sectors, such as accounting and finance, to support Mainland enterprises wishing to expand overseas.

Members of the DoJ's Advisory Group of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Lawyers and representatives from Hong Kong's accounting sector gave thematic presentations on the framework enhancement for Mainland enterprises in going global and cross-cultural compliance, as well as on leveraging Hong Kong's professional services such as accounting and taxation services for better planning and risk management. After that, delegation members held roundtable discussions on common legal issues faced by enterprises expanding overseas - such as investment planning, trade barriers, intellectual property protection, corporate compliance, and cross-border dispute resolution - and engaged in free exchanges on different topics with Mainland enterprise representatives from various industries.

Dr Cheung said that the visit marked an important step for Hong Kong's professional services sectors to work together with Mainland enterprises to go global together. He highlighted four key features of this event. The first feature is the diverse professional backgrounds of participants, including accountants, barristers, lawyers from Mainland, Hong Kong, Macao and international law firms, as well as Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) practising lawyers. The second feature is the broad expertise of delegation members, covering professional fields such as corporate investment, financing, compliance, intellectual property protection, and cross-border dispute resolution, showcasing Hong Kong's comprehensive capabilities in supporting Mainland enterprises' overseas development. The third features is the large participation of Mainland enterprises covering various potential industries, including finance, information technology, manufacturing, retail, and cultural and sports entertainment that have participated in this activity. The fourth feature is that this marked the first time for Shenzhen and Hong Kong to jointly organise such a collaborative event aiming to explore more effective modes for connecting Mainland enterprises with Hong Kong's professional services.

To deepen the understanding of the latest developments in the judicial system and the handling of foreign-related civil and commercial cases on the Mainland, the delegation also visited the First Circuit Court of the Supreme People's Court and the Shenzhen Centre for Foreign Law Ascertainment which serves as a comprehensive legal service platform designed to assist Mainland enterprises in going global.

Dr Cheung and the delegation returned to Hong Kong after the event in the evening."

EPD investigates oil spill incident in Tin Shui Wai Nullah,2025-12-10 17:51,2025-12-10 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000572.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) said today (December 10) that it is investigating the oil spill incident in the Tin Shui Wai Nullah. It is preliminarily suspected that the incident involved an illegal fuelling station. The EPD is conducting follow-up and enforcement actions in collaboration with the relevant departments.

  Upon receiving reports from members of the public and the Drainage Services Department (DSD) on December 8, the EPD immediately initiated investigations and follow-up actions. The EPD and the DSD quickly placed oil absorption materials at multiple locations along the nullah to contain the spread of oil, and conducted clean-up operations to mitigate environmental impact and safeguard the surrounding ecosystem. In-situ water quality monitoring was carried out, and the results confirmed that the water quality parameters remained within the normal range, with no fish deaths detected.

  Based on the EPD's further investigation, the oil spill incident was suspected to be related to an illegal fuelling station on Tin Ha Road, Yuen Long. The department is currently collecting evidence with a view to instituting prosecutions against those responsible parties for the illegal discharge. The case relating to the illegal fuelling station has also been referred to relevant departments for follow-up action.

  An EPD spokesman said that the department will not tolerate any acts of environmental pollution and will take stringent enforcement actions against those who violate environmental legislation. The EPD will continue to closely monitor the water quality of the Tin Shui Wai Nullah and, in collaboration with the DSD, carry on with clean-up operations in the nullah."

Following are Mr Cheuk’s remarks:

Reporter: Does the Government intend to redevelop the Tai Po site, and how will authorities settle the affected residents in the long run? And how much, in number terms, from the fund will be needed to do so? And as of today, how much is left in the $3.4 billion fund, and how can the fund’s transparency be assured? And how is the progress on forming the independent committee? The government mentioned it was looking for a judge a few days ago. So when will the committee start working and investigating? Can you tell us the timeline? Thank you.

Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration: I try to respond to your questions, not particularly in the order you asked those questions. I think the forming of the independent committee is being very vigorously pursued. And I think at the appropriate juncture, the Government will make the announcement.

  As regards how much is left in in our Support Fund (Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po) for helping the persons affected by the fire, I just mentioned that so far, our commitment is about $460 million. So we have about $2.8 billion left in the Support Fund. And what's your first and second question?

Reporter: The intention of the Tai Po site. Will it be redeveloped as considered?

Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration: I also did mention that the Chief Executive has asked the Deputy Financial Secretary to look into the long-term housing and accommodation needs of the victims of this fire. So I think there are obviously many possibilities, and there are different options, many factors to consider, and I think the ultimate use of the fire site will depend on what are the propositions that we come up with. So it has to await that side of the work to be complete.

​政務司副司長和民政及青年事務局局長就「大埔宏福苑援助基金」會見傳媒答問內容（附短片）,2025-12-10 17:18,2025-12-10 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/10/P2025121000556.htm,"政務司副司長卓永興今日（十二月十日）聯同民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟就「大埔宏福苑援助基金」會見傳媒。以下是他們的答問內容：

政務司副司長：各位記者朋友，大埔宏福苑的大火在十一月二十六日發生後，政府隨即在十一月二十七日，按《民政及青年事務局局長法團條例》（香港法例第1044章），成立由民政及青年事務局局長作信託人的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」，接受有心支援宏福苑居民人士和機構的捐獻。至今，「援助基金」已收到約31億元的外界捐款，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，「援助基金」總額大概是34億元，款項會為受大埔宏福苑火災影響的人士提供經濟援助及支持各項相關的工作。

根據信託聲明，「援助基金」設有督導委員會。督導委員會由我領導，就基金的運作等事宜作出建議，並督導和監察基金轄下援助項目的設立和推行情況。督導委員會由各有關政策局的局長和部門首長組成，成員包括：民政及青年事務局局長、勞工及福利局局長、教育局局長、房屋局局長和醫務衞生局局長等。庫務署署長擔任「援助基金」的會計師，負責現金流管理及備存會計帳目和記錄。基金的帳目將按照香港法例第1044章的規定呈交審計署署長進行審計，而「援助基金」的報告也會提交立法會省覽。

督導委員會以至全政府都會本着同一宗旨，就是確保籌集所得的善款都用得其所，全數用於協助居民應付困境，並提供中長期的支援，協助他們重過新生活、重建家園。因此，各政策局及部門為「援助基金」提供的行政支援及執行「援助基金」項目的相關開支，將由有關政策局或部門自行承擔，不會向基金要求回撥成本。

對各界善長及普羅市民的慷慨捐獻，我們深表感謝。至今收到的31億元善款，是來自26萬3千多宗捐款。當中，一萬元以下的捐款有約27萬7千宗（應為25萬7千宗），500萬元以上的捐款有約170宗，佔31億元捐款中的17億元。政府會於下星期起處理向捐款者發放捐款收據的事宜，詳情我們稍後公布。一如其他慈善捐款，上述對「援助基金」的捐獻是可以獲得稅務寬減。為感謝各善長和方便市民，今次稅務局會特事特辦，五萬元或以下的捐款，若以轉帳方式過戶至基金戶口，只要保留有關捐款記錄，以作核實，亦可獲稅務寬減。

在今日督導委員會的正式會議上，我們通過了一項特別補助予宏福苑業主，就是向每個單位的業主發放一次性的10萬元補助。現時在「援助基金」下推出的支援主要是以住戶為對象，部分住戶是租戶而非業主。我們在過去一段時間探訪和接觸受影響居民的過程中，了解到有業主依靠出租宏福苑單位的收入應付日常開支，火災令他們失去這筆收入，亦有業主早前亦投入了一定資金為單位進行裝修和維修，因此也有損失和現金流壓力。有關資助以宏福苑單位為對象，因此即使有單位有超過一名業主，我們以每戶計算，補助額都是10萬元。

剛才說過，截至今日「援助基金」的總額約為34億元，我想告知大家，各項已經公布緊急援助項目（包括剛公布給業主的特別補助）的承擔額約為4億6千多萬元。就向受災人士發放款項方面，我們向死者家屬發放20萬元慰問金及5萬元殮葬金的數目是106宗、向每戶受影響家庭發放10萬元生活津貼的數目是1 617宗、向每名受傷人士發放5萬至10萬元受傷補助的數目是64宗，另外發放2萬元補助給宏福苑外藉家庭傭工、學生和工友的數目，分別是63、220和110宗。

除緊急援助外，正如剛才所說，「援助基金」也會提供中長期的支援予居民，協助他們走出困境和重過新生活。各相關政策局及部門會在這方面繼續進行研究，並適時向督導委員會提交建議。我的匯報到此。

記者：想問之前政府為死者家屬提供20萬元慰問金和為每戶受影響住戶提供10萬元生活津貼，會否考慮提高金額？謝謝。

政務司副司長：我先回答，再看看麥局長有沒有補充。我們其實在過去這段日子提出了各項補助金，亦已經因應居民的需要而發放，這是一個持續的過程，如果我們繼續接觸時發現他們有其他需要，我們會考慮需要支援的方案。

記者：剛才說了一些數字，可否有一個確實的數字反映現時市民的捐款用了多少錢？未來的安排為何？會否向公眾交代如果有錢剩下，如何安排善後的支援？多謝。

政務司副司長：剛才所說的承擔額，為4億6千多萬元。這個金額未用完，我們看到各方面派發補助金的進展是良好的。至於你覺得如果有用剩的（捐款），會如何處理？我們不斷強調，我們給予受災居民的支援是持續的，並會涉及中長期的支援。大家亦知道，行政長官已指派應急住宿安排工作組，研究宏福苑居民的長期住屋和居住的問題。在這方面，我們亦要看看屆時會有甚麼方案出來，如果有此需要時，基金會如何作出配合。

記者：你好，想請教外界有人關注，這次火災，政府都有大量援助，但如果日後不幸再有火災發生，其實政府的援助機制會否都是一樣，還是今次只是因應這件事件特事特辦？正常機制是如何？另外，剛剛有提過其實今次再有一個新（補助）發放給業主，想知道短期的支援措施是否就是這麼多？整個基金會否說是預留多少成資金用作中長期的援助？謝謝。

政務司副司長：其實火災發生到現在，時間都不是很長，我們一直推出幫助市民的援助措施。是否現在已經做得差不多？我不可以這樣說，一定會因應新的問題、新的需要，我們要適時提供協助。至於你說我們現在的種種安排，或將來有類似的情況會怎樣，這是一個假設性問題。這次確實有很多事情特事特辦，但我相信每一件事，如果有這麼不幸的事情發生，我們都要按當時的情況處理。

民政及青年事務局局長︰我想補充，大家要記得這次火警發生至今，政府以往在處理事故時，有既定機制或援助機制，這些是一般會有的，但是我想大家都同意，今次規模之大，受影響人數之多，對社會造成的影響，故政府今次採取了很多、如剛才政務司副司長所說的特事特辦，亦用了很多方法盡快、彈性幫助受影響的居民和災民。至於將來，最重要是怎樣預防這些不幸的事故再次發生，我們要避免、預防，而不是去想將來怎樣再處理。這就是為何特首在成立三個工作小組時，其中一個是調查和規管的工作組，調查規管工作做得好，就希望不會再發生不幸事故。

而這次大家看到整個政府不同部門，正如政務司副司長剛才介紹，無論是基金的處理，我們得到庫務署等不同部門快速的協助，處理二十多萬個捐款交易，我們要怎樣去處理那些個案等等，無論是社會福利署的社工同事，又或是勞工處，又譬如教育局，所有牽涉的同事，大家都很彈性地處理盡快發款的方法。所以簡單來說，面對將來，我們第一時間一定要想，怎樣避免再有這些事故發生。第二，在處理這次火警時，整個善後工作，我們已用了超出一般的處理方法。政府固然對事故有既定機制，但這次我們要做的已超出了一般做法。同事和不同部門都是多走一步，希望幫助受影響居民。
