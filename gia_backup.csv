在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-12 11:50,2025-08-12 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200313.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 12) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

A spokesman for the EDB said that the MUSSS would benefit Hong Kong students pursuing undergraduate studies in 201 designated Mainland institutions, including 145 institutions participating in the Scheme for Admission of Hong Kong Students to Mainland Higher Education Institutions for the 2025/26 academic year.

Eligible students may apply for a means-tested subsidy (only for those students who have passed the means test) or a non-means-tested subsidy under the MUSSS. The subsidy under the MUSSS is granted on a yearly basis, and the subsidised period covers the normal duration of the undergraduate programme pursued by the student concerned in the designated Mainland institution. Eligible applicants may only receive either a means-tested subsidy or a non-means-tested subsidy in the same academic year. The MUSSS is not subject to any quota. It is envisaged that the MUSSS will benefit most Hong Kong students who are pursuing undergraduate studies on the Mainland and have different financial needs.

The subsidy under the MUSSS will be disbursed based on the distance between the locations of the institutions and Hong Kong, which will be grouped into three categories. Details of the subsidy rates under the different categories are set out in the Annex.

Details of the MUSSS are available on the EDB website (www.edb.gov.hk/musss). Eligible students are required to submit their applications via the MUSSS Electronic Application Platform (musss.edb.gov.hk) or send the completed application forms by post to the EDB on or before October 13.

尊敬的王松苗秘書長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室秘書長）、許正中董事長（紫荊文化集團董事長）、舒心院長（香港哲學研究院院長）、各位哲學界領袖、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興出席今天2025香港哲學紫荊國際論壇的開幕式，與一眾海內外的哲學家和學者一起參與這場盛大的哲學交流。

香港哲學研究院自從二○二四年成立以來，以「博學躬行，追求卓越」為理念，致力推動哲學交流、引導社會深入、有條理地思考問題，促進多元文化對話。研究院成立短短一年多，不僅成功創辦《香港哲學研究》雜誌，更聯合不同學術機構舉辦高質量活動，為哲學研究注入源源不絕的動力。

哲學聽起來很抽象，但其實與每個人都息息相關。哲學教我們理性地梳理複雜問題──當面對爭議時，哲學訓練我們分辨事實與觀點；遭遇困境時，哲學啓發我們多角度審視問題的本質。這種理性思考的能力，正是構建個人價值觀的基石。

更重要的是，哲學為社會凝聚共識提供重要的支撐。在價值觀日益多元的時代，哲學對話教我們用邏輯取代偏激，以同理心理解差異。通過探討倫理、權利與責任等根本問題，我們能共同尋求社會發展的平衡點，為香港建設更包容、更具前瞻性的未來奠定思想基礎。

這次論壇匯聚多位頂尖哲學家，陣容鼎盛，稍後展開的橫跨東西方哲學傳統的學術對話，相信會迸發精彩的思想火花，為哲學研究帶來新的啓示與突破。

我相信，哲學思維的培養，直接關係到批判力、道德觀與公民意識的養成。我期望香港哲學紫荊國際論壇能成為具備國際影響力的平台，為推動香港發展成為中外文化藝術中心作出貢獻。

我也希望研究院未來能吸納更多青年參與不同活動，讓哲學不只留在課室與書本，而是能走入社會，在通過學術研究、教育和文化交流，促進傳承與創新的同時，讓理性思考融入日常生活，成為社會持續進步的推動力。

最後，我祝願論壇圓滿成功，成果豐碩！謝謝大家！"

  In August, all the 10 survey areas covered in the second batch recorded a gravidtrap index level lower than 10 per cent.

  The FEHD has so far announced the first and the second batches of the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 23 survey areas. Among these 23 survey areas, 17 recorded a decrease in the Gravidtrap Index as compared with the Area Gravidtrap Index in last month, i.e. July 2025, representing improvement in the areas' mosquito infestation condition. The index of one area remained the same, while four areas recorded a slight increase but the index was lower than 10 per cent. In response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation, the FEHD has activated a mechanism that strengthen mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20per cent or above. The FEHD, in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, will strengthen the mosquito elimination work in So Kwun Wat, Tuen Mun, identify locations with high mosquito infestation, and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

  The FEHD appeals to members of the public to adopt the following measures, strengthening the prevention against the breeding of mosquitoes:

Tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water in containers inside their premises;
Remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
Completely change the water in flower vases at least once a week and remove the water on the plant saucers;
Properly cover all containers that hold water;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers; and
Level irregular ground surfaces and holes.


  Starting August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

  Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

​八月份第二批涵蓋10個監察地區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數全部在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月第一批及第二批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共23個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，在23個監察區中，有17個監察區的指數下跌，代表蚊患情況改善；有一區與上月一樣；另有四區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手在屯門掃管笏強化滅蚊工作，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

食環署呼籲市民採取以下措施，加強防範蚊子滋生：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除所有多餘積水，並消除滲漏源頭；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，清除盤栽墊碟裏的水；
蓋好所有盛水容器；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；及
鋪平或填補不平坦的地面及孔洞。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的地區誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。
 
食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

The DH announced last month that three types of suspected unregistered pCms were seized from Macrobiotics Enterprises Limited located at Room 155, 1/F, Peninsula Centre, 67 Mody Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon. They all have the same name and packaging. However, one had Chinese words ""å¼·å"" marked on it, one had Chinese words ""è¶ç´"" marked on it and one had Chinese words ""ç¹ç´"" marked on it. The sample marked Chinese words ""è¶ç´"" failed to comply with the sterile requirement for eye preparations upon sterility test, indicating the safety and quality issues of the product.

Eye preparations must comply with the sterility requirement. Otherwise, there is a risk of causing eye infection. Although no related adverse reports have been received by the DH so far, members of the public who have purchased the above products are reminded again to stop using them immediately. Those who have applied the products and are feeling unwell should seek advice from healthcare professionals. People who have the product can submit it to the DH's Chinese Medicine Regulatory Office on 16/F, AIA Kowloon Tower, Landmark East, 100 How Ming Street, Kwun Tong, during office hours for disposal.

In response to the above test result, the DH has strengthened the inspection and remind the retailers not to purchase and sell the above products. The use of unregistered pCms may pose threats to public health as their safety, quality and efficacy are not proven. All registered pCms should carry a Hong Kong registration number on the product label in the format of 'HKC-XXXXX'. The list of registered pCms is published on the website of the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong (www.cmchk.org.hk/pcm/eng/#main_dis.htm) for public reference.

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-11 19:32,2025-08-11 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100689.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 11), no new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to maintain strict environmental hygiene and to take mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Those who suspect they may be infected with CF should seek medical advice promptly and avoid self-testing, which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Public should not undergo self-tests

""Currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. Noting that some online advertisements claim to sell rapid test products for CF that can be used by the public for self-testing, the DH has immediately contacted the manufacturer concerned, who subsequently confirmed that the product is not intended for self-testing by the public. The manufacturer has also notified the suppliers in Hong Kong to suspend retail sales of the product in Hong Kong,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Dr Tsui reminded the public to promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and not to conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to ""Reye's syndrome"", a serious and potentially fatal complication.

Furthermore, the DH noted that a local research institution is actively developing rapid test products for CF. The DH has proactively contacted the institution concerned to learn more about the performance and quality of these test products, and hasencouragedthe institutionto apply tolist theirtested productsundertheDH'svoluntary""Medical Device Administrative Control System"".

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

Hong Kong has recorded a total of five confirmed CF cases this year, all of which are imported cases, as well as one possible case. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

""According to the information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, in the past week (August 3 to 9), there were 1 387 new CF cases in Guangdong, a significant decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 2 892 cases (July 27 to August 2) and 2 940 cases (July 20 to 26) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. However, we must remain vigilant and continue to adopt a multipronged approach to prevent local transmission,"" Dr Tsui said.

The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers, conduct health assessment for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

 Dr Tsui reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can effectively prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

「商約」惜水運動頒獎典禮　表揚逾1 000工商機構珍惜用水（附圖）,2025-08-11 19:03,2025-08-11 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100378.htm,"水務署聯同環保促進會合辦「商約」惜水運動，並於今日（八月十一日）舉行第二屆「商約」惜水運動頒獎典禮，表揚參與的工商機構或場所及其員工在節約用水方面的卓越貢獻。頒獎典禮的主禮嘉賓包括水務署署長黃恩諾及環保促進會行政總幹事何惠萍。

本屆惜水運動繼續獲工商界熱烈響應，參與機構或場所由首屆600多間增至本屆逾1 000間。自惜水運動於二○二二年展開後，所有參與機構或場所的總用水量按年累積減少約160萬立方米，相當於約640個奧林匹克標準游泳池。

水務署署長黃恩諾在典禮致辭時表示，在全球氣候變化的影響下，極端天氣越趨頻繁，水資源管理面臨前所未有的壓力。政府推行全面水資源管理策略，強調「先節後增」，以確保可持續地運用水資源。他強調，本港非住宅用水佔全港食水用量約四成，大部分都與工商界用水有關，業界積極參與「商約」惜水運動對推動節水工作至關重要。他讚揚參與機構展現創新精神，推出多項節水方案，更有機構制定長達十年的節水規劃，充分體現前瞻性思維。

「商約」惜水運動為工商機構提供合作平台，通過簽署節水承諾書、委任「惜水經理」、舉辦宣傳教育活動、鼓勵安裝節約用水設備及嘉許計劃等推動非住宅用戶減少用水，助力香港邁向節水型城市。

今屆頒獎典禮頒發多個獎項，包括「惜水推廣大獎」、「傑出商約惜水經理」及「循環再用惜水大獎」等，亦頒發了「惜水嘉許獎」及「惜水設備安裝嘉許計劃」，鼓勵業界參與。得獎名單載於「商約」惜水運動網頁（www.greencouncil.org/ech2o）。"
Enterprises Cherish Water Campaign Awards Ceremony commends over 1 000 commercial and industrial organisations for water conservation (with photos),2025-08-11 19:03,2025-08-11 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100379.htm,"The Water Supplies Department (WSD) and the Green Council jointly organised the Enterprises Cherish Water Campaign (ECH2O) and held the 2nd ECH2O Awards Ceremony today (August 11) to commend the outstanding contributions to water conservation by the participating commercial and industrial organisations, their premises, and staff. Officiating guests at the ceremony included the Director of Water Supplies, Mr Roger Wong, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Green Council, Ms Linda Ho.

This campaign continues to receive enthusiastic support from the commercial and industrial sectors, with participation increasing from over 600 organisations or premises during the first campaign to more than 1 000 organisations during the current one. Since the campaign's launch in 2022, all participating organisations or premises have achieved an aggregate reduction of total water consumption over these years amounting to about 1.6 million cubic metres, which is equivalent to 640 Olympic-size swimming pools.

In his speech at the ceremony, Mr Wong said that under the impact of global climate change, extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent, and are placing unprecedented pressure on water resources management. The Government has implemented the Total Water Management Strategy, with an emphasis on strengthening water conservation and exploiting diversified water resources to ensure sustainable use of water resources. He highlighted that non-domestic water consumption accounts for about 40 per cent of fresh water consumption in Hong Kong, and most of it is closely related to use in commercial and industrial sectors. Active participation in the ECH2O is therefore crucial in driving water-saving efforts. He praised participating organisations for their innovative approaches, and for implementing various water-saving initiatives, with some even formulating 10-year water conservation plans, reflecting a forward-thinking commitment.

The ECH2O provides a collaborative platform for commercial and industrial organisations to cherish water together through various initiatives, including the signing of a charter, appointment of an ECH2O Manager, promotion and education, promoting the installation of water-saving devices and recognition programmes, etc, to encourage non-domestic consumers to reduce water consumption, thereby contributing to Hong Kong's goal of moving towards a water-saving city.

The awards presented at this ceremony included the Grand Cherishing Water Promotion Award, Outstanding ECH2O Manager Award, and Grand Water Reuse and Recycling Award. The Cherishing Water Recognition Award and the Water Efficient Device Installation Commendation Scheme were also presented to encourage industry participation. The list of winners is available on the ECH2O website (www.greencouncil.org/ech2o)."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-11 18:50,2025-08-11 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100612.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心提醒市民，不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。

市民不應自行進行檢測

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「目前，市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證的快速測試產品，供市民自行測試基孔肯雅熱。對於有網上廣告表示有出售聲稱可供市民自行測試的基孔肯雅熱快速測試產品，衞生署已即時向有關生產商了解，該生產商確認有關產品並非供市民作自行測試用途，該生產商並已通知有關香港供應商暫停在本港零售該產品。」

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。市民亦不應自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

此外，衞生署留意到有本港科研機構正積極研發基孔肯雅熱快速測試產品，衞生署已主動聯繫有關機構，了解測試的性能和品質，並鼓勵有關機構將通過測試的產品申請表列於衞生署設立的自願性「醫療器械行政管理制度」。

繼續加強防控

​本港今年累計錄得五宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三日至九日）廣東省新增1 387宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別為2 892宗（七月二十七日至八月二日）及2 940宗（七月二十日至二十六日）明顯減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然如此，我們仍不能掉以輕心，必須繼續多管齊下，避免出現本地傳播。」

中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

 Mr Yau first visited Wellington and met with the Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Forestry, Minister for Trade and Investment and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand, Mr Todd McClay. Mr Yau gave him an update on Hong Kong's latest economic developments and initiatives to promote trade and investment, such as the deduction in liquor duty. They also exchanged views on strengthening bilateral relations to bring mutual benefits.

 Turning to regional co-operation, Mr Yau highlighted Hong Kong's readiness for early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) - the world's largest free trade agreement. The 15 RCEP economies are all Hong Kong's major trading partners, collectively accounting for 70 per cent of Hong Kong's total trade. He called for New Zealand's support for Hong Kong's early accession to RCEP, through which the city is committed to making important contributions to regional economic development and integration.

 Mr Yau also met with the Chair of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise and board member of Invest New Zealand Mr Charles Finny to gain a better understanding of the latest developments of local industries and exchange views on co-operation opportunities. Mr Yau also shared with him Hong Kong's unique advantages and favourable business environment that present tremendous business opportunities for New Zealand enterprises and investors.

 Meanwhile, Mr Yau paid a courtesy call on the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Niue, Dr Wang Xiaolong, to keep him abreast of Hong Kong's latest developments and efforts in deepening international exchanges and co-operation, with a view to coping with the changes in the global economic and trade landscape.

 In the evening, Mr Yau attended a business dinner cohosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, Sydney and BusinessNZ to promote Hong Kong's strategic location and its roles as an international trade centre and investment hub. He said that Hong Kong is the world's fifth-largest merchandise trading entity, after the Mainland, the United States, the European Union and Japan. Meanwhile, according to the World Investment Report 2025, global foreign direct investment inflows to Hong Kong reached US$126 billion in 2024, ranking Hong Kong third globally. This is a vote of confidence in Hong Kong by investors. Hong Kong is also home to around 10 000 foreign companies from around the world, with many of them eyeing the Mainland and Southeast Asian markets.

 He also briefed the participants on the vast potential of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) with a population of 87 million and a GDP of US$2 trillion. He encouraged the local business sector to explore GBA business opportunities and also enjoy preferential treatment under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement, leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantage as a gateway to the GBA and Mainland markets.

 Mr Yau will proceed to Auckland tomorrow (August 12)."

二零二五年七月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100459.htm,"政府統計處今日（八月十一日）發表二零二五年七月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年六月在收縮區域的41.6上升至二零二五年七月的42.1，而未來一個月（即二零二五年八月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.5。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但不少統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年七月較上月上升，特別是地產業（從44.2上升至46.2）及商用服務業（從43.5上升至44.8）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數在二零二五年七月維持在45.0，而未來一個月（即二零二五年八月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.0。

評論

政府發言人表示，七月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均略為改善。同時，整體就業情況維持大致穩定。

展望未來，外圍環境不確定性高企，將繼續影響本地營商氣氛。然而，本地經濟表現強韌，加上亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，應可提供支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100447.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (August 11) reported the latest number of cases of Legionnaires' disease (LD), and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From August 3 to 9, the CHP recorded seven community-acquired LD cases. The details of the cases are as follows:


A 59-year-old female patient with good past healthliving in Tuen Mun District;
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Yuen Long District;
A 69-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in North District;
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Eastern District;
A 63-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Kwun Tong District;
A 99-year-old female patient with underlying illnesses living in Central and Western District; and
A 70-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Southern District.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigation revealed that all seven cases are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of August 9, 103 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for July 2025,2025-08-11 16:30,2025-08-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/11/P2025081100461.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (August 11) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for July 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 41.6 in June 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.1 in July 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. August 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.5. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in July 2025 as compared with previous month for many surveyed sectors, particularly for the real estate (from 44.2 to 46.2) and business services (from 43.5 to 44.8).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades remained at 45.0 in July 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. August 2025) was 47.0.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time both improved slightly in July. Meanwhile, the overall employment situation remained largely stable.

  Looking ahead, the elevated uncertainties in the external environment would continue to affect the local business sentiment. Nonetheless, the resilient local economy and steady economic growth in Asia, particularly in the Mainland, should provide support. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 8 to noon today (August 11), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 382 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

In addition, the CERC also determined eight registrations of ex-officio EC members as valid.

Candidates nominated for EC subsectors election

As regards the 93 vacancies in the EC membership to be returned by the 2025 EC Subsector By-elections, by the close of nominations on August 4, the Returning Officers (ROs) received a total of 101 nomination forms for candidates. Upon review, the CERC has determined 100 candidates as validly nominated. One candidate had passed away during the nomination period. The CERC thus determined his nomination as invalid in accordance with relevant electoral law.

Members returned by nominations for EC subsectors

As for the 10 members to be returned through supplementary nominations by designated bodies, the ROs received a total of eight nomination forms submitted by designated bodies, involving 11 nominees. According to section 12(2) of the Electoral Affairs Commission (Electoral Procedure)(Election Committee) Regulation (Cap. 541I), the CERC is only required to determine the validity of nominations for the number that are necessary for filling the assigned seats of the subsector-concerned. In this connection, the CERC has determined 10 nominations, according to the priorities indicated by the designated bodies, are sufficient for filling the number of seats assigned to the subsectors. The CERC had not determined the eligibility of an additional nominee.

Registrations of ex-officio EC members

In accordance with section 5J of the Schedule to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance (Cap. 569), a person holding a specified office under Part 2A of the Schedule may register as an ex-officio EC member. If the specified person concerned is not eligible to be registered as an ex-officio member or is the holder of more than one specified office, he/she may designate another person who is holding an office in a relevant body in relation to the specified office to be registered as anex-officio member.

The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) has received eight registrations for ex-officio members. Upon review, the CERC has determined that these eight registrations are valid. The subsectors and specified offices involved are listed below:




Subsector
Specified Office


Architectural, surveying, planning and landscape

the Chairman of the Building Contractors Committee
the Chairman of the Lift and Escalator Safety Advisory Committee




Medical and health services


the Chairman of the Board of Governors of The Prince Philip Dental Hospital

The REO and respective ROs will inform all registrants for ex-officio members, nominees and candidates about the CERC's determination. The relevant gazette notices, upon publication, will also be uploaded to the election website (www.elections.gov.hk) and REO's website.

The CERC is chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, with three official members (Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai; Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; and Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak Mei-kuen) and three non-official members (Miss Elsie Leung Oi-sie, Mrs Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai and Professor Lawrence Lau Juen-yee). In accordance with Annex I to the Basic Law, the CERC is responsible for reviewing and confirming the eligibility of candidates for EC membership (including ex-officio members).
