僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-08-14 06:42,2025-08-14 07:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400198.htm,"勞工處今日（八月十四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-08-14 06:42,2025-08-14 07:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/14/P2025081400199.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 14) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 14) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

FEHD continues to strengthen mosquito control and elimination efforts in Kwai Tsing District in view of imported chikungunya fever cases (with photos),2025-08-13 22:49,2025-08-13 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300966.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (August 13) that in view of an imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) announced by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) last night, the FEHD has immediately carried out anti-mosquito work at various locations in the vicinity of Ta Chuen Ping Street, Kwai Tsing District, where the patient resides. Such work include removing stagnant water, cleansing streets and applying larvicides to reduce the risk of disease transmission. The FEHD will also convene a meeting of the inter-departmental task force on anti-mosquito work in the district to coordinate departments and stakeholders in taking joint actions for mosquito prevention and control.

There have been industrial and recycling operations in the area near Ta Chuen Ping Street. Having found recyclers putting articles in public places during inspections, the FEHD officers hence instituted prosecution against the offenders and requested them to remove the articles immediately. As for the accumulation of articles in private areas nearby, the FEHD has warned the responsible persons that they must handle the articles properly to prevent mosquito breeding, or they will face prosecution.

In addition, the FEHD found water dripping from air-conditioners in residential units nearby during inspections, causing water accumulation in some of the back alleys. The FEHD has issued / will issue statutory notices to the owners or occupiers of the relevant premises, requiring them to rectify the situation within a specified period. At the same time, the FEHD has referred to the relevant department for follow-up actions on the uneven surfaces of back alleys to prevent from re-occurrence of water accumulation in the long run.

Moreover, in collaboration with Kwai Tsing District Council members, the FEHD distributed anti-mosquito promotional leaflets to shop owners and members of the public this morning to raise residents' awareness of mosquito prevention. The FEHD will also continue to conduct vector investigations within 250-metre radius of residence of the patient involved in the case announced last night. Immediate actions will be taken upon detection of mosquito breeding grounds, including removal of stagnant water and fogging operations to eradicate adult mosquitoes.

The imported cases recently announced also involve patients residing in Kwai Tsing District. The FEHD will continue to collaborate with relevant departments and stakeholders and conduct mosquito control and elimination work in the area near the patients' residence, to reduce the risk of disease transmission. The department will also step up publicity and education efforts with local community to raise public awareness of mosquito prevention.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

· Tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
· Remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
· Check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks, to prevent stagnant water;
· Change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants no more than every 7 days;
· Properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquito from accessing the water; and
· Properly dispose articles that are able to contain water such as empty lunch boxes and cans.

Members of the public may refer to the FEHD's webpage on mosquito prevention and control (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html#), and should constantly pay attention to the information regarding CF released by the CHP of the DH. The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems."
TD provides convenience for direct issue of Hong Kong Full Driving Licence applications in multi-pronged approach,2025-08-13 22:40,2025-08-13 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300307.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) announced today (August 13) that new short, medium and long-term measures will be launched in phases towards the full implementation of online appointment services for application for direct issue of Hong Kong Full Driving Licence and quotas will be increased gradually, thereby improving efficiency and providing greater convenience to the public.

New arrangement on queue ticketing

  From today onwards, new queue ticketing requirements will be imposed on agents submitting ""direct issue"" applications at the Hong Kong Licensing Office at United Centre, Admiralty. When obtaining a ticket, all agents are required to input their identification document numbers and those of each of the respective applicants into the queue ticketing system. Such information will be printed on the ticket. Counter staff will verify the information of both the ticket holder and the applicant(s) entered during application processing. If any information does not match that printed on the ticket, all applications concerned will not be processed.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""The operation of the new arrangement today has largely been smooth. To ensure fair use of services by the public in need in an orderly manner, we will further enhance ""direct issue"" application procedures and provide more convenience for the public. We will expand our capacity and introduce new multi-pronged initiatives to promote digitalisation of licensing services.""

Towards full implementation of online appointment services

Short-term measure: Strengthening checks to improve online appointment arrangements

Starting from September, the TD will strengthen co-operation with relevant issuing authorities of driving licences, including more checks on ""direct issue"" applicants' information in relation to Mainland driving licences provided via online appointments. If any information is found to be untrue, the relevant appointments will be cancelled and such quotas will be reopened for appointment by other applicants, enhancing the effective operation of the system;


Medium-term measure: Full implementation of online appointment for counter services to replace on-site queue ticketing arrangements and enhancement of processing capacity

In the fourth quarter, the TD will accept online appointments for ""direct issue"" counter services only and no on-site queue ticketing will be arranged. By that time, the counter services for ""direct issue"" will be expanded to the other three Licensing Offices, namely the Kowloon Licensing Office at Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, the Kwun Tong Licensing Office at Kowloon East Government Offices and the Sha Tin Licensing Office at Sha Tin Government Offices, and the number of appointment quotas will be increased. Applicants must upload proof documents when making online appointments for verification of eligibility. If any information is found to be untrue, the relevant appointments will be cancelled; and


Long-term measure: Studying full implementation of online application as facilitation

The TD is actively studying the use of artificial intelligence technologies in ""direct issue"" application procedures. Applicants who uploaded proof documents during online appointments with initial approval only need to bring their original application documents for verification at Licensing Offices during their booked timeslots. A full driving licence can then be issued within the same day. This provides convenience for them to submit applications on their own, reducing the need to submit applications via agents.


  The spokesman stressed that the TD has been processing and verifying every ""direct issue"" application in a stringent manner. Applicants must submit sufficient, true and accurate documentary proof, and their applications will only be approved when they fully meet the eligibility criteria stipulated under the law.

  The TD has introduced various e-licensing services in the past year, including the enhanced vehicle licence providing convenience for vehicle owners who do not need to replace the paper licence after renewal; the development of e-Licensing Portal which is an one-stop online platform for managing licences; setting up International Driving Permit (IDP) Self-service Kiosks; and the launch of E-Auction enabling the public to bid for their desired vehicle registration marks. Following more and more online government services connected to the ""iAM Smart"", applications for most licences and driving test services can now be submitted online. At present, about 60 per cent of applicants for IDP applications and 50 per cent of full driving licence renewal applications are submitted online.

  The TD will continue to promote digitalisation of licensing services and details of the above new initiatives will be released in due course."
HKSAR Government strongly condemns external forces' smearing on Hong Kong under the pretext of Lai Chee-ying's case,2025-08-13 22:00,2025-08-13 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300849.htm,"âThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (August 13) strongly disapproved and rejected the slanderous remarks made by external forces, including anti-China media organisations, regarding Lai Chee-ying's case under the Hong Kong National Security Law and the treatment provided to him during his custody. Their intention to smear and attack the HKSAR Government is blatantly obvious and must be sternly denounced to set the record straight.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that as the legal proceedings involving Lai Chee-ying are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the case in an attempt to interfere with the court to exercise judicial power independently, which might otherwise constitute perverting the course of justice. However, external forces and anti-China media still continue to distort the truth, blatantly discredit the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR.""

CSD correctional facilities are humane and safe

The spokesman reiterated, ""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support will be provided. If inmates require further examination and treatment, they will be referred to specialist medical staff or to public hospitals for further follow-up. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected. The CSD also adopts the above arrangements when handling matters related to Lai Chee-ying, which are no different from those applicable to other PICs.

  ""In fact, Lai Chee-ying's legal representative has already made a clarification earlier that Lai Chee-ying has all along been receiving suitable treatment and care in prison. However, external forces choose to turn a blind eye to these facts and evidence, and carry on with their malicious political maneuvers with ulterior motives. The HKSAR Government strongly opposes such actions.

""We must once again point out the fact that the arrangement for Lai Chee-ying's removal from association from other PICs has all along been made at his own request and approved by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law. The remarks by these external forces regarding Lai Chee-ying's solitary confinement are completely fact-twisting, reflecting a malicious intention to smear and attack the HKSAR Government.""

Upholding the rule of law

The spokesman said, ""Article 5 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and section 2 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) clearly provide that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing, and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security, and that the right to defend and other rights in judicial proceedings that a criminal suspect, defendant, and other parties in judicial proceedings are entitled to under the law shall be protected. The offences endangering national security stipulated by the HKNSL and SNSO target acts endangering national security with precision, and define the elements and penalties of the offences with clarity. The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation.

""All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled in a fair and timely manner by the law enforcement, prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR as required by Article 42(1) of the HKNSL. The time taken between the institution of prosecution and the completion of trial of each case depends on a multitude of factors. The prosecution and defence will adhere to any direction given by the court to ensure a timely trial.

Freedoms of the press and of speech protected

""Human rights in Hong Kong have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. As far as the media landscape is concerned, it has been as vibrant as ever in the HKSAR since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO. However, freedom of the press and freedom of speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. As long as they are not in violation of the law, the media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise Government policies without any restriction. In recent cases, the Court cited judicial precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding freedom of the press, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.

""The HKSAR will continue to resolutely discharge the responsibility of safeguarding national security, effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities that endanger national security in accordance with the law, and safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people in accordance with the law at the same time,"" the spokesman emphasised."

丘應樺在酒會上致辭時表示，悉尼經貿辦於一九九五年成立，肩負起促進及加強香港與澳洲及新西蘭在經濟、貿易和文化方面聯繫的重要使命，並致力加深兩國對香港的認識。過去三十年，悉尼經貿辦一直發揮重要角色，促進香港與澳洲之間的溝通與協作，成為連繫兩地社群的重要橋樑，為未來更深層次的合作奠下堅實基礎。

丘應樺指出，去年香港是澳洲第十大出口市場，雙邊商品貿易額約達80億澳元。同時，澳洲在二○二三年亦是香港第八大服務貿易夥伴。這些數字反映雙方關係日益深化，有賴於雙邊交流日增、共同堅持自由貿易，以及兩地經濟體所展現的創新精神。

SCED attends reception to celebrate 30th anniversary of Sydney ETO in Australia,2025-08-13 20:38,2025-08-13 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300294.htm,"  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau,proceeded to Sydney today (August 13) to start his visit to Australia to deepen collaboration in trade and investment between Hong Kong and Australia.

 Upon arrival, Mr Yau attended a reception hosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, Sydney (Sydney ETO) to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its establishment.

 Speaking at the reception, Mr Yau remarked that the Sydney ETO was set up in 1995 with an important mission to promote and strengthen Hong Kong's economic, trade and cultural ties with Australia and New Zealand as well as foster a better understanding of Hong Kong in the two countries. Over the last three decades, the Sydney ETO has played a crucial role in facilitating communication and collaboration between Hong Kong and Australia, serving as a vital connector that brings together the two communities and laying a strong foundation for even deeper co-operation in the years ahead.

 Mr Yau noted that in 2024, Hong Kong was Australia's 10th-largest export market, with bilateral trade in goods between the two places reaching approximately AUD8 billion. Australia was also Hong Kong's eighth-largest trading partner in services in 2023. These figures reflect the deepening of the relationship, fuelled by increased bilateral exchanges, shared commitment to free trade, and the innovative spirit that defines both economies.

 He further noted the strong post-pandemic recovery in tourism and connectivity, citing the growing flow of visitors to Hong Kong and vibrant expatriate communities between Hong Kong and Australia as a testament to the enduring strength of bilateral relations.

 Meanwhile, Mr Yau outlined Hong Kong's ongoing initiatives to enhance its business environment and regional competitiveness, such as the Top Talent Pass Scheme to attract global talent and foster innovation, and the recent reduction of the duty rate on liquor to promote liquor trade. He also highlighted Hong Kong's abundant opportunities for Australian businesses and its role as a key entry point into the fast-growing markets of the Mainland and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

 On regional trade, Mr Yau said that Hong Kong is actively seeking to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and its accession to RCEP will enhance regional value chains and create new synergies in various areas, benefitting Australian exporters, service providers and investors alike.

 Today's reception brought together over 300 distinguished guests from various sectors, including political and business circles, media, academia, community groups and government representatives. A special exhibition highlighted the Sydney ETO's diverse engagements over the past three decades, ranging from hosting high-level visits and leading business delegations to organising economic forums and staging cultural performances, demonstrating the growing depth and breadth of Hong Kong's ties with Australia and New Zealand. Another section of the showcase spotlighted Hong Kong's unique strengths as Asia's world city and a dynamic hub for global business.

 In addition, before proceeding to Sydney today from Auckland, New Zealand, Mr Yau paid a courtesy call on the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Auckland, Mr Chen Shijie, to update him on the latest social and economic developments in Hong Kong.

 Mr Yau will continue his visit to Sydney tomorrow (August 14)."

文化體育及旅遊局局長出席動漫藝術節2025開幕儀式致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-08-13 20:22,2025-08-13 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300787.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（八月十三日）出席動漫藝術節2025開幕儀式的致辭全文：

Raymond (Board of Governors and Chairman of the Arts Programme Committee of the Hong Kong Arts Centre, Mr Raymond Fung), Mr Kim (Co-founder of Superani, Curator of Kim Jung Gi: A Journey to Endless Lines Exhibition, Mr Hyunjin Kim), ladies and gentlemen,

I’m sorry, Mr Kim, that the speech is prepared in Cantonese, so I hope that subsequently there will be a recap for you.

大家晚上好！我很高興出席動漫藝術節2025的開幕儀式。

今年是香港藝術中心首次舉辦大型動漫藝術節，這次藝術節除了呈獻來自60多位藝術家的超過150幅手繪作品，還正如大家聽到Peter（香港藝術中心監督團主席劉文邦）和Rebecca（香港藝術中心總幹事葉思芬）所指，推出藝術快閃商店、現場繪畫示範、公眾導賞團等一系列富有趣味的活動，我相信觀眾可以充分體驗藝術、享受藝術。

香港特區政府一直致力推動文創產業的發展。去年十一月公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》當中明確提出將香港打造成流行文化之都是其中一個很重要的目標。文化體育及旅遊局轄下的文創產業發展處（文創處）以產業導向為原則，透過「創意智優計劃」持續支持本地漫畫家和漫畫企業發展。其中，剛剛在上個月香港動漫電玩節中舉辦的「港漫動力」展館是「創意智優計劃」的其中一個重點項目，當時展出了16間本地企業在計劃支援下出版的全新原創漫畫，有利於培育本地漫畫人才，推動本地原創漫畫發展。

「港漫動力」這項漫畫支援計劃，成功培育了不少新晉漫畫家，當中其中一部作品《達利書店》更在同樣由文創處資助的第五屆香港出版雙年獎，從超過420本涵蓋不同題材的參選出版物中脫穎而出，成為雙年獎歷來第一本獲最高殊榮出版大獎的漫畫書，真的要給予一些掌聲，充分體現了政府資助對於藝術發展、漫畫發展有很大的幫助。

此外，業界在推動文創產業發展方面的成效亦有目共睹。現在、今個月在香港正舉辦大受歡迎的「CHIIKAWA DAYS」大型特展，其主辦單位AllRightsReserved其實在過去一年亦先後主辦《100%多啦A夢&FRIENDS巡迴特展（香港）》及《PANDA GO!香港遊》，均成功吸引大批市民及旅客蜂湧參觀，感受潮流文化所帶來的多元魅力及無窮歡樂。還有兩日，海洋公園的龍鳳胎大熊貓加加和得得便一歲生日，海洋公園亦根據香港六隻大熊貓的外型特徵打造Panda Friends IP，推出不同商品，並授權不同品牌使用有關IP推出聯乘產品，均大受歡迎。最近，為了慶祝大熊貓加加和得得一歲生日，香港旅遊發展局與香港藝術家龍家昇合作，推出大熊貓生日特別版Labubu，讓我們可以透過知名IP向全球宣傳推廣香港及熊貓旅遊。

香港藝術中心一直積極舉辦各類藝術活動，推動藝術教育。今日的動漫藝術節，不僅呈獻殿堂級大師經典作品，還為大家展示來自新晉創作人，以致同學、學生們的手繪作品，有利於推動香港動漫藝術和文創產業的發展。我也很希望在往後的特展，展示的是我們香港藝術家、漫畫藝術家、你們的IP、你們的作品、你們的人物。

我希望大家積極參與這次動漫藝術節，為本地藝術家喝采亦期待大家繼續支持香港藝術中心和本地藝術家。祝願動漫藝術節2025圓滿成功，祝願各位觀眾有一個難忘而富啓發性的藝術體驗。謝謝大家。"
食環署因應基孔肯雅熱輸入個案持續在葵青區加強控蚊滅蚊工作（附圖）,2025-08-13 20:13,2025-08-13 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300731.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（八月十三日）表示，因應衞生署衞生防護中心昨晚（八月十二日）公布的一宗基孔肯雅熱輸入個案，食環署已立即在患者居住的葵青區打磚坪街一帶多個地點展開滅蚊工作，包括清除積水、清掃街道及施放蚊藥等，減低疾病傳播風險。食環署亦會在區內召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」會議，協調各部門及持份者共同採取防治蚊患行動。

打磚坪街一帶有工業及回收作業進行，食環署人員巡查發現回收店鋪將物品放置在公眾地方，已向違例人士提出檢控，並要求即時移走阻街物品。就附近私人範圍堆積的物品，食環署已警告負責人必須妥善處理，以避免蚊蟲滋生，否則會被檢控。

此外，食環署在巡查期間發現附近大廈單位有冷氣機滴水，導致部分後巷出現積水。食環署會向有關處所的業主／佔用人發出法定通知，指示其在指定限期內糾正情況。同時，食環署已就後巷路面凹凸不平的情況轉介相關部門跟進，以長遠避免積水問題再現。

另外，食環署今早聯同葵青區區議員向商戶和市民派發防蚊宣傳單張，提高居民的防蚊意識。食環署亦會繼續在昨晚公布的個案患者住所250米範圍內進行病媒調查，如發現蚊子滋生地會立即跟進，包括清除積水及霧化殺滅成蚊等。

近日公布的輸入個案中亦有居於葵青區的患者，食環署聯同相關部門及持份者在患者住所附近的控蚊滅蚊工作會持續進行，以減低疾病傳播風險，亦會與地區人士合作加強宣傳教育，提高市民的防蚊意識。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


市民可參考食環署有關防控蚊患的網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html#），亦應持續留意衞生署衞生防護中心發出有關基孔肯雅熱的資訊。如有發現蚊患情況，請致電1823。"
特區政府強烈譴責外部勢力假借「黎智英案」抹黑香港,2025-08-13 20:13,2025-08-13 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300801.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（八月十三日）對外部勢力，包括反華傳媒機構，就黎智英涉及《香港國安法》案件，以及其羈押情況的抹黑言論，表示強烈不滿及反對。他們污衊和攻擊特區政府的險惡用心昭然若揭，必須嚴厲直斥其非，以正視聽。

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府已多次強調，由於黎智英所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不應評論有關案件以圖干預法院獨立進行審判，否則可能構成妨礙司法公正。雖然如此，外部勢力和反華媒體仍繼續顛倒是非、公然抹黑香港特區的司法制度和審訊，企圖美化犯罪行為及向特區法院施壓。」

懲教院所人道安全

發言人重申：「懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供良好的通風環境、合適和及時的醫療支援。有需要的在囚人士也會獲轉介到診專科醫療人員或至公立醫院繼續跟進。懲教署也設有一系列機制，例如透過獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排，以確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。懲教署處理黎智英相關事宜，均採取上述安排，與其他在囚人士無異。」

「事實上，黎智英的代表律師早已澄清，清楚指出黎智英在獄中一直獲得適切的治療和待遇，但反華勢力卻選擇對有關事實和證據視而不見，繼續其別有用心的卑劣政治操作，特區政府對此表示強烈不滿及反對。」

「我們必須再次指出事實，有關黎智英與其他囚犯中止交往的安排，一直是根據黎智英本人的意願並由懲教署經考慮所有相關因素後依法安排的。這些反華勢力企圖藉黎智英被單獨監禁一事作出失實言論，攻擊特區政府，用心險惡。」

堅守法治原則

發言人表示：「《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則，並保障犯罪嫌疑人、被告人和其他訴訟參與人依法享有的辯護權和其他訴訟權利。《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》訂明的危害國家安全的罪行精準針對危害國家安全的行為，清楚訂明構成有關罪行的元素和刑罰。香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關人士或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與涉事人士或組織的政治立場、背景或職業無關。」

「特區的執法、檢控及司法機關在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，均會嚴格遵循《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的規定，公正、及時辦理有關案件。每宗案件由提出檢控直至審訊完成所需的時間，視乎多項因素而定。控辯雙方會跟從法庭給予的指示，確保及時審理有關案件。」

新聞和言論自由獲保障

「人權在香港一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。就傳媒環境而言，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，香港特區的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。然而，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。法庭在近年的案件引用了歐洲人權法院關於新聞自由的判例，指出即使是報道涉及備受公眾關注的重要議題，在《歐洲人權公約》下也不享有完全不受限制的言論自由；最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障。」

發言人強調：「香港特區會繼續堅定不移地履行維護國家安全的責任，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由。」"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-13 19:26,2025-08-13 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300759.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 13), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures, especially upon returning to Hong Kong from regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Individuals experiencing symptoms such as fever or acute joint pain should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors of their travel history. Do not attempt self-testing, as this may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Regarding the probable case involving a 22-year-old female announced earlier, the CHP collected another blood sample from the patient on August 11 (i.e. the 17th day after the onset of symptoms) for testing. The result indicated that she had been infected during her trip to Madagascar and had already recovered. Therefore, the case is not classified as a confirmed case in Hong Kong.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of six confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, in the past week (August 3 to 9), there were 1 387 new CF cases in Guangdong, a significant decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 2 892 cases (July 27 to August 2) and 2 940 cases (July 20 to 26) respectively. All the cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. However, we must remain vigilant and continue to adopt a multipronged approach to prevent local transmission,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow up when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public, currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. They should promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and not to conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to ""Reye's syndrome"", a serious and potentially fatal complication.

He also added that members of the public should adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can effectively prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Tuen Mun Hospital announces incident involving patient's ventilator identified as not being in normal operating mode,2025-08-13 18:50,2025-08-13 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300700.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

âThe spokesperson for Tuen Mun Hospital made the following announcement today (August 13) regarding an incident involving a patient's ventilator that was identified as not being in normal operating mode:

On August 7, a 48-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital's Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with acute necrotising pancreatitis, complicated by acute kidney injury and respiratory failure. He was started on continuous renal replacement therapy. As the patient's condition remained critical, healthcare staff intubated him and connected him to a mechanical ventilator on August 10 to assist with his breathing.

At about 7am yesterday (August 12), healthcare staff made adjustments to the ventilator and replaced the respiratory circuit. After four minutes, the patient developed oxygen desaturation, triggering the alarm system. Healthcare staff attended to the patient correspondingly. During this period, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest. The clinical team initiated resuscitation promptly, and the patient's heartbeat was restored two minutes later. During the resuscitation, it was discovered that the ventilator was not in normal operating mode, and the staff rectified the equipment's operation mode immediately to enable resumption of normal operation.

The patient was conscious and able to respond to the instructions of the healthcare staff after the event. A thorough assessment and relevant examinations have been conducted, showing that patient's vital signs were stable. A Computerised Tomography Scan has been done, and the clinical team has initially determined that the incident had no significant impact on his overall condition. The clinical team will continue to closely monitor the patient's clinical condition and provide appropriate treatment.

The hospital is very concerned about the incident and met with the patient's family to explain the details of the incident. The hospital will maintain close communication with the family, offering all possible assistance and follow-up care. The patient is still hospitalised in ICU due to his underlying diseases.

The hospital has reported the incident to the Hospital Authority Head Office through the Advance Incident Reporting System. The hospital will investigate the reasons why the ventilator was not in normal operating mode and make recommendations to prevent recurrence of similar events."

International co-operation is indispensable in ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of drugs and medical devices, as well as in enhancing tobacco control to protect community health. I look forward to Hong Kong and Singapore collaborating to create synergy and share the best practices to bolster public health protection and promote medical innovation, thereby further strengthening the healthy and steady development of the healthcare systems in both places.""

The MOU aims to enhance the co-operation between the two places in areas such as regulation of drugs and medical devices, promoting tobacco control policy and enforcement, as well as regulatory capacity enhancement and training, with a view to jointly promoting the high-quality development of the regulation of drugs and medical devices.

 During the meeting with the founding Executive Director of CoRE, Professor John Lim, Professor Lo introduced the initiatives put forward by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub, including strengthening the approval regimes for drugs and medical devices, as well as establishing the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of 2026 to foster growth in the local healthcare and biotechnology industries.

 Professor Lo also gained insights on CoRE's significant contributions to Singapore's healthcare regulatory system over the past decade through capacity building, strengthening collaboration and fostering innovation.

Moreover, under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

八月二十八日起，首四個項目就會開始賣票；當然有其他在澳門和廣東省舉行的一些項目也開始賣票。希望大家留意，多多支持，踴躍購票入場，支持所有運動員，特別我們香港隊運動員。

記者：這次全運會實施了實名制，是不是首次？為甚麼有這個安排？可以前一日轉讓門票，會否擔心有黃牛黨？會否附加條件，例如只可轉讓予親戚？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：楊主任今早也說了，我相信今早發布會也提到的，用實名制其實也有需要讓大家轉讓（門票）的，因為有時候可能買了票，未必有空，或患病或怎樣，（轉讓門票）給朋友或親人都是可以容許的。但是要24小時前，不可即場轉換姓名的，這個大家要注意，這是第一。

第二，買票時，廣東省方面的票（務網）站安排，是會有一些科技元素，若看到不尋常的大眾購票（情況）的話，會有方法處理的。另外在香港方面，我們也有線下購票，中旅社（香港中國旅行社）會安排11個購票點，大家也可以實體買門票的。

記者：如果可以轉讓的話，可能有黃牛黨到前一日將自己買的門票轉讓，怎樣打擊黃牛黨？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：首先用了實名制，是一個比較好的、穩妥的辦法。如果轉讓（門票），三地也會很緊密留意這個安排。我勸喻大家購票的時候，都是在官網途徑，以及在實體線下的途徑。既然有這麼多途徑都可以買到票，這麼方便，不要光顧黃牛。因為除了黃牛，大家擔心的轉讓，其實大家現在都見到的，會有不法之徒造假門票，所以在官方網絡、官方渠道購買（門票）是最重要的。多謝各位。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-13 18:00,2025-08-13 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300666.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月十三日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心提醒市民應採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後。若出現發燒或急性關節痛等病徵，應立即就醫並通知醫生相關旅遊史，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。

另外，就早前公布涉及一名22歲女子的可能個案，中心在八月十一日（發病後第十七天）再為病人採集血液樣本進行檢測，顯示她早前在馬達加斯加旅遊期間曾受到感染並已經康復，因此中心不會列作確診個案。

本港今年累計錄得六宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三日至九日）廣東省新增1 387宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別為2 892宗（七月二十七日至八月二日）及2 940宗（七月二十日至二十六日）明顯減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然如此，我們仍不能掉以輕心，必須繼續多管齊下，避免出現本地傳播。」

中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，目前，市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證的快速測試產品，供市民自行測試基孔肯雅熱。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。市民亦不應自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

他補充，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

The formation of Care Teams aims to consolidate community resources to care for community members and strengthen district networks in support of district-based initiatives. The spokesman reminded members of the public that Care Teams will never ask members of the public for bank account numbers. Members and volunteers of Care Teams will wear Care Team uniforms and display Care Team member or Volunteer Certificates of Identity for identification when providing caring services.

Several key topics were discussed at the meeting, including the work progress of the various groups under the Three-tier Prevention Framework and the global and local terrorism threat landscape, as well as the direction and strategies of the CT work of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).

 Mr Lee directed at the meeting that relevant bureaux and departments (B/Ds) should conduct a large-scale interdepartmental CT exercise in late August, simulating responses to terrorist attacks on critical infrastructure in Hong Kong, with a view to further enhancing the HKSAR Government's CT preparedness and response capabilities. 

 Mr Lee said, ""While Hong Kong is safe and stable in general, the global terrorism situation has remained complex. As a metropolitan city, Hong Kong may also face threats under the global and local terrorism landscape. As such, we must further strengthen the HKSAR Government's overall CT work. This large-scale CT drill will effectively enhance CT awareness and the co-ordination capability of different B/Ds in responding to various forms of terrorist attacks.""

 To strengthen CT preparedness, the CE's 2024 Policy Address announced the establishment of the Three-tier Prevention Framework, comprising the CESG at the first tier (top tier), which steers and formulates CT policies and directions; the Secretary for Security Counter-terrorism Co-ordinating Group at the second tier, which co-ordinates B/Ds' co-operation on CT matters; and seven interdepartmental working groups at the third tier, which follow up on specific studies and carry out CT work.

 The CESG is led by the CE, with the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Financial Secretary and the Secretary for Justice serving as deputy chairmen. Its members include representatives from B/Ds including the Security Bureau, the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Immigration Department, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department, the Fire Services Department, the Correctional Services Department and the Government Flying Service."

李家超在會議上指示各相關政策局和部門於八月下旬舉行大型跨部門反恐演練，模擬應對恐怖分子對香港的重要基礎設施發動襲擊，進一步提升特區政府的反恐準備及應變能力。

文化體育及旅遊局局長：（我）都想再次跟大家說一說，我知道今早已經有一個記者會發布了十五運會（第十五屆全國運動會）、全運會和殘特奧會（全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會）的售票安排。大家今日八月十三日開始，已經可以上全運會網站進行登記。今日的登記是讓大家在八月二十八日開始可以購買全運會門票，所以大家可以在這兩個星期左右的時間進行登記。

登記也很簡單，用香港身份證，而如果有需要去廣東省看比賽的話，就登記回鄉證，屆時就可以購票。購票也很簡單，可以上網，八月二十八日開始有第一批的票。香港舉辦的項目，首四個項目可在八月二十八日起上網購買，我們也有線下（選擇），即是可以實體買票，屆時中旅社（香港中國旅行社）也有11個購票點，詳情會適時公布。希望大家先快點登記，也密切注意購票公布。

票價其實亦非常大眾化的，由50元人民幣到500元人民幣不等，視乎賽事項目而定，大部分的門票其實都是100元以下的。另外，我們殘特奧會也有三個項目可供購票，門票是20元人民幣，應該大眾市民都可以踴躍入場參觀全運會，為所有健兒，特別是我們香港隊的健兒打氣。

記者：現在香港的配套進度如何？特別是對殘疾運動員的配套進度如何？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：你指配套的意思是針對比賽的時候？

記者：是。

文化體育及旅遊局局長：這一定是我們全力做、很重要的事情。首先，所有殘特奧會運動員入住的酒店，我們在招標時已經要求有所有無障礙設施，他們的房間也需大小充足，讓他們的儀器或裝備，以至輪椅等等都可以活動自如。在比賽場地，我們也已經試辦過一些賽事，以測試設備的準備情況，效果是令人滿意的。當然會有一些微調，我們現在也是繼續在做。多謝各位。"

李家超歡迎懷進鵬部長率團訪港，出席中國國際大學生創新大賽港澳區域賽和其他教育相關活動。李家超表示，教育部大力支持香港特別行政區（特區）政府優化教育工作，發展香港成為國際教育樞紐和國際高端人才集聚高地。香港是全球唯一擁有五間全球百強大學的城市，特區政府通過各種措施，推廣「留學香港」品牌，同時大力推動內地與香港高等教育合作，以配合國家科教興國、人才強國和創新驅動發展戰略。

李家超表示，北部都會區是香港未來發展的重要引擎，特區政府正積極推進北都大學教育城的發展，鼓勵本地頂尖大學與中外知名院校合作，以靈活創新的發展模式，開拓更多創新、前沿和高層次的品牌課程、研究合作和交流項目，培育人才，進一步提升香港學術及研究的國際影響力。

在科研方面，李家超說，特區政府大力推動數字教育，同時正提效提速發展河套深港科技創新合作區香港園區（河套香港園區）。他歡迎更多內地高校及科研機構到河套香港園區設立實驗室或研發中心，善用園區的獨特優勢，拓展更多國際科研合作，攜手強化「產、學、研」的協作，貢獻國家高質量發展。"

（外匯基金諮詢委員會於二○二五年七月十七日批准公布）

二○二五年四月十七日至六月二十日期間的貨幣發行局運作報告
—————————————————————————————
貨幣發行委員會（委員會）獲悉，於報告期內，港元兌美元在7.7500至7.8499之間上落。由於資本市場活動暢旺，尤其港股通南向資金持續錄得淨流入，港元匯率在四月下半月轉強。在五月初，面對部分亞洲區內貨幣兌美元大幅升值及股市相關需求持續，強方兌換保證被觸發四次，香港金融管理局（金管局）在強方兌換保證下沽出1,294億港元，總結餘亦相應上升至約1,740億港元。在聯繫匯率制度下，港元銀行同業拆息大致跟隨美元利率走勢，同時亦受本地港元資金供求情況影響。隨着兌換保證被觸發後港元資金供應相對充裕，港元銀行同業拆息回軟。港元與美元的負息差擴闊引發套息交易活動，對港元構成壓力，港元匯率於六月轉弱至接近弱方兌換保證的水平。貼現窗的使用情況未見異常。整體而言，港元外匯及銀行同業市場交易繼續暢順有序。

委員會獲悉，於報告期末時貨幣基礎增加至21,250.3億港元。貨幣基礎的所有變動與外匯儲備的變動完全一致，符合貨幣發行局制度的原則。

報告期內貨幣發行局制度的運作報告載於附件。

對風險及不穩定因素的監察
————————————
委員會注意到，美國自四月以來公布連串的關稅措施，加上對財政可持續性的憂慮加深，已引發環球金融市場波動，並促使主要先進經濟體長期政府債券的收益率急升。亞洲經濟體方面，實施廣泛的美國關稅及持續的不確定性，或會削弱整個地區的增長動力、對區內金融市場造成壓力，以及影響其綜合供應鏈網絡。

委員會注意到，在美國加徵關稅下，中國內地出口在四月及五月仍繼續穩健增長。雖然中美貿易談判有助緩解對內地貿易前景的部分擔憂，但經濟增長前景仍面對阻力。內地當局在五月公布金融政策方案，包括降低政策利率及存款準備金率，並推出措施提振消費，尤其是服務行業。

委員會注意到，香港在第一季度的經濟增長較預期為高，但關稅帶來的不明朗因素仍對經濟構成壓力。然而，多管齊下的支持措施，加上港元利率下調及內地市場氣氛改善，可抵銷部分不利影響。另一方面，隨着貿易緊張局勢緩和及按揭利率下降，樓市氣氛出現回穩跡象，五月成交量大致保持穩定。商用物業市場則因空置率持續高企而繼續面對挑戰。

銀行同業流動性及銀行同業拆息
———————————————
委員會備悉一份探討港元銀行同業流動性與銀行同業拆息之間關係的研究報告。"

Record of discussion of meeting of Exchange Fund Advisory Committee Currency Board Sub-Committee held on July 2,2025-08-13 16:30,2025-08-13 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300548.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

(Approved for Issue by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee on July 17, 2025)

Report on Currency Board Operations (April 17 - June 20, 2025)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Currency Board Sub-Committee (Sub-Committee) noted that the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) traded within a range of 7.7500 - 7.8499 against the US dollar (USD) during the review period. The HKD exchange rate firmed in the second half of April due to buoyant capital market activities and, in particular, continued net inflows through the Southbound Stock Connect. In early May, amid the sharp appreciation of some Asian currencies against the USD and continued equity-related demand, the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking (CU) was triggered four times, with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) selling HK$129.40 billion under the strong-side CU. The Aggregate Balance rose correspondingly to around HK$174 billion. While HKD interbank rates (HIBORs) generally track their USD counterparts under the Linked Exchange Rate System, they are also influenced by the local supply and demand of HKD funding. HIBORs softened as the supply of HKD funding was relatively abundant after the CU triggering. Widened negative HKD-USD interest rate spread incentivised carry trade activities which weighed on the HKD, easing to levels close to the weak-side CU in June. No abnormality was noted in the usage of the Discount Window. Overall, the HKD exchange and interbank markets continued to trade in a smooth and orderly manner.

The Sub-Committee noted that the Monetary Base increased to HK$2,125.03 billion at the end of the review period. In accordance with the Currency Board principles, all changes in the Monetary Base had been fully matched by changes in foreign reserves.

The Report on Currency Board Operations for the review period is at Annex.

Monitoring of Risks and Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------------
The Sub-Committee noted that the series of US tariff announcements since April, combined with heightened concerns over fiscal sustainability, had triggered volatility in global financial markets and contributed to a surge in long-term government bond yields across major advanced economies. For Asian economies, the imposition of widespread US tariffs and the ongoing uncertainty might undermine the region's growth momentum, exert pressure on regional financial markets, and impact its integrated supply chain networks.

The Sub-Committee noted that in Mainland China, exports continued to grow at a solid pace in April and May amid the US tariff hikes. While the China-US trade talks had helped ease some concerns around the Mainland's trade outlook, the economic growth outlook continued to face headwinds. In May, the Mainland authorities announced a financial policy package, which included cuts in the policy rate and the required reserve ratio, and rolled out measures to boost consumption, particularly in the services sector.

The Sub-Committee noted that in Hong Kong, while economic growth was higher than expected in Q1, the uncertainties stemming from the tariffs continued to weigh on the economy. However, multifaceted supportive measures, along with decreasing HKD interest rates and improved sentiment on the Mainland, could offset the adverse effects somewhat. Meanwhile, housing market sentiment showed signs of stabilisation amid the de-escalation of trade tensions and the decrease in mortgage rates, with transaction volume remaining broadly steady in May. The commercial real estate markets continued to face challenges due to the persistently high vacancy rates.

Interbank Liquidity and Interbank Interest Rates
------------------------------------------------------
The Sub-Committee noted a paper that studied the relationship between HKD interbank liquidity and interbank interest rates."

Hong Kong is the only city with five universities in the world's top 100, and the HKSAR Government is taking forward a series of initiativesto promote the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand while vigorously advancing collaboration in higher education between the Mainland and Hong Kong to support the national strategies of invigorating the country through science and education, strengthening the nation with talent, and driving development through innovation.

Mr Lee said the Northern Metropolis is the key engine for Hong Kong's future development, and the HKSAR Government is advancing the development of the Northern Metropolis University Town. It encourages local top universities to introduce more innovative, cutting-edge and high-level branded programmes, research collaboration and exchange projects with renowned Mainland and overseas institutions in a flexible and innovative manner to nurture talent and further boost Hong Kong's global academic research influence.

In scientific research, Mr Lee said that the HKSAR Government is actively promoting digital education and the construction of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone with enhanced speed and efficiency.He welcomed more Mainland higher education institutions and research institutes to set up laboratories or research centres to leverage the Hong Kong Park's unique advantages for exploring more global research collaboration and jointly strengthening co-operation among the industry, academia and research sectors to contribute to the high-quality development of the country."

派籌新安排

由即日起，位於金鐘統一中心的香港牌照事務處對代辦申請免試簽發的人士實行新的派籌要求。所有代辦在領取即日籌時，須於系統同時輸入其個人和各申請人的身分證明文件號碼，有關資料會列印於其籌號。櫃位人員在處理申請時會核對籌號持有人及申請人資料；如與籌號所印不符，所有申請一概不獲受理。

運輸署發言人說：「新安排今日運作大致暢順。為確保有需要的市民公平有序地使用服務，我們將進一步優化免試簽發申請程序和便利市民，擴容增量、多管齊下推出新措施，推動牌證服務電子化。」

邁向全面推行網上預約服務

短期措施：加強查核，改善網上預約安排

署方由九月起，將與有關駕駛執照簽發機構加強合作，包括增加查核免試簽發申請人經網上預約提供的內地駕駛證的資料。如發現資料不真確，預約將被取消，名額會重新開放供其他申請人預約，讓網上預約更有效地運作；


中期措施：全面推行網上預約櫃位服務，取代現場派籌安排，提升處理能力

運輸署在第四季將全面透過網上預約免試簽發櫃位服務，現場不設派籌。屆時，處理免試簽發的櫃位服務會擴展至其餘三個牌照事務處，即位於長沙灣政府合署的九龍牌照事務處、東九龍政府合署的觀塘牌照事務處和沙田政府合署的沙田牌照事務處，並增加預約名額。申請人須在網上預約時上載證明文件核實資格，如發現資料不真確，預約將被取消；及


長期措施：便利申請，研究全面網上辦理申請

獲奬泉州提線木偶戲九月亮相「中華文化節2025」綻放古藝新姿（附圖）,2025-08-13 14:30,2025-08-13 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300315.htm,"泉州市提線木偶戲傳承保護中心九月帶同其獲奬節目《古藝新姿木偶戲》重臨香江，於康樂及文化事務署（康文署）策劃的「中華文化節2025」展演七齣經典小戲，並由國家級非物質文化遺產（非遺）代表傳承人陳應鴻率領一眾資深和新晉操偶者，以精巧的木偶造型、細膩的操線功和獨特的劇種音樂，展現閩南民俗千年非遺技藝。

泉州提線木偶戲，古稱「懸絲傀儡」，源於秦漢，晉唐時隨中原移民南遷入閩。傳承至今，保存700多齣傳統劇目和由300多支曲牌唱腔構成的獨有劇種音樂「傀儡調」（包含「壓腳鼓」、「鉦鑼」等古樂器及相應的演奏技法），並發展出一套成熟的操線功夫和獨具特色的偶頭雕刻、木偶造型和製作工藝，劇目中亦保存大量閩南地區的民間習俗和方言俚語。泉州提線木偶戲二○○六年被列入首批國家級非物質文化遺產代表性項目名錄，於二○一二年入選聯合國教科文組織保護非物質文化遺產優秀實踐名冊。

《古藝新姿木偶戲》於二○○二年榮獲第十屆文華獎，多年來曾在五大洲80多個國家和地區上演，劇目多元豐富，其中《元宵樂》重現泉州元宵節期間具有閩南民俗風情的「踩街」場面，當中有「拍胸」、「跳鼓」、「舞獅」等民間舞蹈特色，為長演不衰的劇目；《貴妃醉酒》將京劇的唱腔與「傀儡調」混搭，體現南北戲劇藝術交流的魅力；《若蘭行》出自古戲《織錦回文》選段，細膩刻劃主角蘇若蘭千里尋夫的艱難。

此外，操偶者透過精準而細膩的操線功賦予木偶生命和靈魂，如《小沙彌下山》的木偶小沙彌在風雨路上慌急情狀的各種精妙步態；《鍾馗醉酒》的木偶鍾馗能做到提壺、飲酒、打嗝等動作；《獅子舞》則結合提線木偶和掌中木偶技法，表現母子雙獅親昵嬉戲；《馴猴》的木偶猴子更會彈吉他、騎單車和跟隨的士高音樂跳舞，惟肖惟妙，展現泉州提線木偶在守正創新中煥發的新活力。每場表演設有互動環節，讓觀眾有機會近距離欣賞這項非遺技藝。

泉州市提線木偶戲傳承保護中心成立於一九五二年，是泉州提線木偶戲的主要傳承者。藝團曾多次到訪不同國家和地區演出，並多次參與全國性重要的藝術活動和中央電視台的春節聯歡晚會，亦曾參加二○一九年新年戲曲晚會。

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-08-13 14:30,2025-08-13 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300484.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."
Award-winning Quanzhou string puppetry to grace Chinese Culture Festival 2025 in September with timeless charm of ancient art (with photos),2025-08-13 14:30,2025-08-13 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300316.htm,"  The Quanzhou Marionette Show Inheritance and Protection Center will return to Hong Kong this September with its acclaimed programme ""Ancient Chinese Puppetry with Timeless Charm"", featuring seven classic short plays at the Chinese Culture Festival 2025, organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD). Led by Chen Yinghong, a representative inheritor of the national intangible cultural heritage, seasoned and emerging puppeteers will showcase millennia-old Minnan (southern Fujian) folk traditions through exquisite puppet modelling, refined string manipulation and the genre's unique musical style.

  Quanzhou string puppetry, historically known as ""hanging silk puppet"", has a long tradition that dates to the Qin and Han dynasties. It was introduced to Fujian by migrants coming from the central plain between the Jin and Tang periods. It has had a repertory of over 700 traditional plays and a unique musical genre called ""kuilei diao"" (or puppet tune, played on ancient instruments such as foot-pressed drums, bell-shaped gongs with corresponding performance techniques), comprising more than 300 set tunes. The art form has developed sophisticated string manipulation skills and unique puppet-head carving, figure modelling and production techniques. Its repertoire retains numerous Minnan folk customs and the dialect. It was included on the first list of Intangible Cultural Heritage at the National Level in 2006, followed by its inscription on UNESCO's Register of Good Safeguarding Practices of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2012.

  ""Ancient Chinese Puppetry with Timeless Charm"", which won the prestigious 10th Wenhua Award in 2002, has captivated audiences across over 80 countries and regions on five continents. This diverse repertoire brings to life the rich heritage of Quanzhou string puppetry through a selection of timeless classics: ""Lantern Festival Delight"" recreates the vibrant Minnan folk tradition of ""Cai Jie"" (street parades) during Quanzhou's Lantern Festival, featuring lively folk dance elements such as ""chest slapping,"" ""jumping drums"" and the lion dance, making it a perennial favourite; ""The Drunken Royal Concubine"" ingeniously blends Peking opera vocals with ""kuilei diao"", showcasing the fascinating exchange between northern and southern theatrical arts; ""Ruolan's Journey"", an excerpt from the ancient play ""The Palindromic Poems on the Brocade"", poignantly depicts the arduous journey of Su Ruolan across 1,000 miles in search of her husband.

  In addition, the puppeteers breathe life and soul into the marionettes through precise and delicate string manipulation. In ""The Little Monk's Descent into the Mountain"", the little monk puppet exhibits a repertoire of intricate stumbling gaits, vividly capturing his flustered haste through wind and rain; the Zhong Kui puppet in ""The Drunkenness of Zhong Kui"" performs nuanced actions such as lifting a wine pot, drinking, and even hiccupping; the ""Lion Dance"" combines string and palm puppetry techniques to portray an affectionate mother-and-cub lion duo at play; the monkey puppet in ""Taming the Monkey"" astounds by playing a guitar, riding a bicycle and grooving to disco beats, showcasing Quanzhou string puppetry's innovative spirit while honouring tradition. The programme also features an interactive segment during each performance, offering audiences a rare chance to engage up close with the intangible cultural heritage artistry.

  Founded in 1952, the Quanzhou Marionette Show Inheritance and Protection Centeris a principal guardian of Quanzhou string puppetry. The troupe has performed across different countries and regions, and has been featured in numerous national-level arts events, including China Central Television's Spring Festival Gala. Notably, the troupe participated in the 2019 New Year Traditional Opera Gala.

  ""Ancient Chinese Puppetry with Timeless Charm""by the Quanzhou Marionette Show Inheritance and Protection Centerwill be held at 7.30pm on September 12 and 13 (Friday and Saturday) at the Theatre of the Sai Wan Ho Civic Centre. Lyrics and dialogues are with Chinese and English surtitles. Tickets priced at $280 and $320 are available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288. Group booking discounts and package booking discounts are available for purchasing selected CCF stage programmes, the ""Chinese Opera Film Shows"" of the Chinese Opera Festival (COF) 2025 and the ""Legacy and Vision: Conversations with Chinese Cultural Masters"" lecture. For programme enquiries and concessionary schemes, please call 2268 7323 or visit www.ccf.gov.hk/en/programme/ancient-chinese-puppetry-with-timeless-charm.

It also aims to attract top-notch artists and arts groups from the Mainland and other parts of the world for exchanges in Chinese arts and culture. The CCF 2025 is held from June to September.

"Special traffic and transport arrangements for Kai Tak Sports Park concerts on August 15 to 17, 19 and 20",2025-08-13 11:00,2025-08-13 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300214.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (August 13) said that, to facilitate the holding of concerts at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) on the evenings of August 15 to 17, 19 and 20, special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to provide convenience for spectators to travel to and from the KTSP. Concertgoers from the Mainland are urged to purchase tickets in advance, plan their journeys early and use the MTR or cross-boundary coach services.

  During the event period, as the traffic in the vicinity of the KTSP is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the interval between trains of the Tuen Ma Line (TML). Franchised bus companies will provide a total of 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (PTI), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port and Airport, and major districts across the territory.

  In addition, the KTSP will arrange cross-boundary coach services during dispersal to facilitate travellers' return to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port, the HZMB and the Shenzhen Bay Port. Passengers should purchase tickets in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal. They should refer to the operators' website (Eternal East Bus: www.myeebus.com/eebusfans; CTG Bus: m.hkctgbus.com/#/layout/home) for the latest ticket information.

  For taxi services, the Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open for taxi pick-up and drop-off. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (4pm to 7.30pm) and suspended for taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid the outflux of spectators, and passengers' patience is appreciated.

  Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day after the concert should pay special attention that, if they use the Lo Wu Control Point, they should catch the last relevant MTR TML train departing from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm, followed by interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line (ERL) to Lo Wu Station. Travellers should plan their journeys ahead and arrive at the station platform in advance.

  Travellers who opt for LMC/HG Port (operating 24 hours daily) may also take the ERL to Sheung Shui Station and then KMB route No. 276B or N73, or take the special bus route No. SP12 directly at the Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA to the Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) PTI, and transfer to the LMC-HG cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) for their journey to the Mainland.

  A spokesman for the TD said that, as a large number of travellers may use the LMC/HG Port after the concert, and football matches will also be held at Hong Kong Stadium on the evenings of August 19 and 20, the Port is expected to be very busy. Travellers' patience is appreciated. To ensure the smooth operation of public transport services, dedicated public transport lanes will be arranged at the LMC/HG Port after midnight during the event period when necessary for the smooth operation of the Yellow Bus and cross-boundary coach services as well as effective dispersal of a large number of cross-boundary travellers. Other cross-boundary private cars and their passengers are expected to have a longer clearance time. The TD has steered operators to reserve standby vehicles and manpower to meet passengers' demand.

  Spectators are advised to heed the real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application and radio and television broadcasts."

至於的士服務，啟德主場館的士上落客區將開放予的士上落客。宋皇臺道上落客區在進場時段（下午四時至七時三十分）只開放予的士落客，離場時段則暫停的士上落客。由於預計離場人士眾多，輪候時間會較長，請耐心輪候登車。

計劃在演唱會完結後即日返回內地的觀眾需特別注意，如經羅湖口岸過關，需趕及港鐵屯馬綫最後一班相關列車，即於晚上十時五十九分由宋皇臺站及十一時○一分由啟德站開出的列車，並於大圍站轉乘東鐵綫往羅湖站。旅客應妥善規劃行程，提前前往車站月台。

使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸（全日24小時通關）過關的旅客，亦可乘搭東鐵綫往上水站轉乘九巴第276B或N73號線，或直接在宋皇臺道上落客區乘搭特別巴士第SP12號線往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處，轉乘落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）返回內地。

運輸署發言人表示，由於或有大量旅客在演唱會後使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸，加上八月十九及二十日晚上香港大球場亦會舉行足球賽事，預計該口岸將十分繁忙，請耐心等候過關。為確保公共交通服務暢順，活動期間午夜十二時後，落馬洲／皇崗口岸將按需要設公共交通專用通道，確保皇巴及跨境巴士行車暢通，更有效疏導大量跨境旅客；其他跨境私家車及其乘客輪候過關時間預計會較長。署方已督導相關營辦商預留足夠車輛和人手，應對乘客需求。

"Two co-owners fined nearly $90,000 for not complying with removal order",2025-08-13 11:00,2025-08-13 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300219.htm,"Two co-owners were convicted and fined $89,440 in total, of which $49,440 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts yesterday (August 12) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 18 square metres on the ground floor of a residential building on Fu Shin Street, Tai Po. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (August 13), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without a reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."
