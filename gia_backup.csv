Speech by SCST at opening ceremony of 26th International Sports Press Association Asia Congress (English only),2025-06-30 12:01,2025-06-30 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000309.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the opening ceremony of the 26th International Sports Press Association (AIPS) Asia Congress today (June 30):

President Gianni Merlo (President of AIPS), Mr Timothy Fok (President of the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China), President Jung Hee-don (President of AIPS Asia), Kenneth (President of the Hong Kong Sports Press Association, Mr Kenneth Fok), Winfried (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Winfried Engelbrecht-Bresges), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning and a big welcome to Hong Kong. It gives me great pleasure to join you today for the opening ceremony of the 26thAIPS Asia Congress. First of all, I would like to thank AIPS Asia and the Hong Kong Sports Press Association for bringing this important event to Hong Kong for the first time.

This year 2025 marks a landmark chapter for Hong Kong as a premier sports events hub. In March, we proudly opened theKai Tak Sports Park, a world-class sports infrastructure. I am sure some of you have already attended thrilling international sports events like the iconic Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, as well as the fascinating concerts that took place at the Kai Tak Stadium. In four weeks’ time, the Hong Kong Football Festival 2025 will bring Liverpool (FC) vs AC Milan, and the first ever North London Derby outside London, Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur, to the Kai Tai Stadium. These sold-out matches of course promise to be an extravaganza for football fans in this part of the world.

In November this year, Hong Kong will join hands withGuangdong Province and MacaoSAR (Special Administrative Region) to co-host the15th National Games of the People's Republic of China. You know, to quote Ma Long, our ping pong captain of China, for many of the sports, ping pong in particular, winning a National Games gold medal is harder than winning an Olympic gold, because the athletes usually have the accolade of a world champion somewhere. All these events are more than just games and competitions. They showcase Hong Kong as a centre for major international sports events and create a festive atmosphere all through our city.

To all our sports journalist friends here, we are going to keep you busy. You will be our partners to capture the many thrilling moments on the stage as well as the compelling human stories behind. Your work will bring all these events to life for audiences around the world, and I look forward to seeing you all at our sports venues, chronicling these defining moments.

Before I close, I cordially invite you to immerse yourself in the unique charm and the iconic attractions of Hong Kong during your stay. I wish the Congress every success and I eagerly anticipate seeing your coverage of our mega events on your platforms. Thank you very much."

《香港國安法》實施五周年 以高水平安全護航高質量發展,2025-06-30 10:30,2025-06-30 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025062900718.htm,"​今日（六月三十日）是《香港國安法》公布實施五周年，香港特別行政區（特區）政府發言人表示，這是重要的日子，因為過去五年來，《香港國安法》為香港實現由亂到治的重大轉折；為維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，奠定了堅實的法律基礎，更是「一國兩制」事業的重要里程碑。

發言人說︰「國家安全是頭等大事，是國家生存與發展的根本前提。香港回歸後一段長時間，在維護國家安全方面處於『不設防』狀態，反中亂港分子及外部敵對勢力不斷挑戰『一國兩制』的原則底線，甚至妄圖奪取香港管治權。從二○一二年『反國教』、二○一四年非法『佔中』、二○一六年旺角暴動，以至二○一九年六月起持續十多個月的『黑暴』和港版『顏色革命』，為香港帶來前所未見的危機，對香港社會、經濟和營商環境造成嚴重破壞，令廣大市民惶恐終日。」

「中央在香港危急關頭果斷出手，全國人民代表大會在二○二○年五月二十八日通過相關決定，並由全國人民代表大會常務委員會在二○二○年六月三十日制定《香港國安法》，將其列入《基本法》附件三，由香港特區在本地公布實施，填補了香港特區維護國家安全法律制度和執行機制的短板漏洞，發揮定海神針的作用，止暴制亂，效果立竿見影，成為香港『由亂到治』的分水嶺，『一法安香江』。」

「其後，憑着特區政府連同立法會及社會各界的努力，香港特區切實履行憲制責任，去年成功完成《基本法》第二十三條本地立法，訂立《維護國家安全條例》，並在二○二四年三月二十三日刊憲生效，完善香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制，與《香港國安法》兼容互補、渾然一體，為香港築牢維護國家安全的堅實屏障。」

發言人強調︰「五年來的實踐證明，《香港國安法》是捍衛『一國兩制』、維護香港繁榮穩定的『守護神』，是具有重大歷史意義和現實意義的好法律。《香港國安法》與其他香港特區維護國家安全的法律均堅持法治原則，同時依法保護權利和自由。今天，香港的營商環境持續改善，位居全球最自由經濟體的榜首、國際金融中心地位穩佔世界第三、世界競爭力排名重返三甲，可見香港正在『由治及興』的大道上全速前進。」

「香港特區維護國家安全的法律保障人權。尊重和保障人權的原則具體細緻地貫穿和體現於《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的條文及相關法律的實施過程。《香港國安法》第四條及《維護國家安全條例》第2條均明確訂明，香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港特區居民根據《基本法》和《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》、《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港的有關規定享有的包括言論、新聞、出版的自由，結社、集會、遊行、示威的自由在內的權利和自由。香港特區維護國家安全法律的各項規定均符合國際標準，在維護國家安全和保障人權自由之間取得合理平衡。」

「事實上，香港特區法治堅實強韌，深受國際社會認可。香港特區執法部門嚴格根據證據和依照法律採取執法行動。律政司在《基本法》第六十三條的保障下主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉，並嚴謹和客觀地按照《檢控守則》以證據和適用法律就每宗案件作出獨立的檢控決定。《基本法》第二條、第十九條及第八十五條明確規定，香港特區享有獨立的司法權和終審權，法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。所有案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。同時，《香港國安法》第五條及《維護國家安全條例》第2條亦明確訂明，防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪時，應當堅持法治原則，包括罪刑法定、無罪推定、一事不再審等原則，並保障犯罪嫌疑人、被告人和其他訴訟參與人依法享有的辯護權和其他訴訟權利。」

「每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這不僅是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》清楚訂明構成有關危害國家安全罪行的元素和刑罰，精準針對佔極少數從事危害國家安全的行為和活動的個人和組織，保障廣大市民的人身和財產安全，奉公守法的人不會從事危害國家安全的行為和活動，不會誤墮法網，根本無需擔心。事實上，自《香港國安法》公布實施以來，社會迅速回復穩定，加上《維護國家安全條例》生效，香港特區居民和在香港的其他人的權利和自由得到更有效保障，經濟持續向好。」

發言人重申：「維護國家安全只有進行時，沒有完成時。中央在二○二五年五月十二日發布的《新時代的中國國家安全白皮書》提到，有域外勢力加大插手中國事務，企圖透過所謂香港問題對中國進行圍堵、打壓、遏制。在地緣政治風險不斷升溫的今天，特區政府必定繼續在《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》的堅實保障下，堅決維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，持續完善相關法律制度和執行機制，以更有效應對不斷變化的國安風險挑戰；以及深化宣傳教育，讓每位市民都自覺維護國家安全，從而形成抵禦外部干預的社會基礎，以高水平安全護航高質量發展，不斷譜寫『一國兩制』實踐新篇章。」"
Ensuring high-quality development with high-level security: Hong Kong National Security Law heralds fifth anniversary,2025-06-30 10:30,2025-06-30 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025062900720.htm,"âToday (June 30) marks the fifth anniversary of the promulgation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). A spokesman for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government said, ""this is a significant day because over the past five years, the HKNSL has enabled Hong Kong to make a major transition from chaos to order and has laid a solid legal foundation for safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests. This in itself is an important milestone in the undertaking of ""one country, two systems"".

The spokesman said, ""National security is a top priority as it forms the basis for a country's existence and development. After reunification, Hong Kong had long been 'undefended' in terms of safeguarding national security. Anti-China elements and external forces continuously challenged the bottom line of the principle of 'one country, two systems', and even attempted to seize the power of governance. Unprecedented crises have been brought to Hong Kong by the 'anti-national education' incident in 2012, the illegal 'Occupy Central' movement in 2014, the Mong Kok riot in 2016, the 'black-clad violence' and Hong Kong version of the 'colour revolution' which lasted for more than ten months since June 2019, severely damaging Hong Kong's societal, economic and business environment and caused the public to live in fear.""

   ""The Central Authorities acted decisively at a critical moment for Hong Kong. On May 28, 2020, the National People's Congress (NPC) made a relevant decision on the basis of which, the NPC Standing Committee enacted, on June 30, 2020, the HKNSL which was then listed under Annex III to the Basic Law for local promulgation and implementation in the HKSAR. The HKNSL has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR, playing the role of a stabilising force that immediately stopped violence and curbed disorder. The implementation of HKNSL was a 'watershed moment' in Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order, as stability and safety of the city have been restored by the law.""

   ""Thereafter, with the concerted efforts of the HKSAR Government, the Legislative Council and all sectors of the community, the HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty last year by completing the legislation of Article 23 of the Basic Law. The Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) took effect upon gazettal on March 23, 2024, improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security. The HKNSL and the SNSO are compatible and complementary, building a strong line of defence to safeguard national security in Hong Kong.""

The spokesman emphasised, ""The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven the law to be a 'guardian' in upholding the principle of 'one country, two systems' and in safeguarding the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. It is an important and timely piece of legislation with profound historical significance. The HKNSL and other laws in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR firmly adhere to the principle of the rule of law while protecting the rights and freedoms in accordance with the law. At present, the business environment has continuously improved. Hong Kong ranks first as the world's freest economy and third among global financial centres, and has returned to the top three in the world in terms of competitiveness, demonstrating that Hong Kong is moving full steam ahead along the path of 'advancing from stability to prosperity'.""

   ""The laws for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR protect human rights. The principles of respecting and protecting human rights, as clearly and comprehensively set out, are embodied in the provisions of the HKNSL and the SNSO as well as in the manner in which they are implemented. Both Article 4 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. The various provisions of the laws for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR are in line with international standards, striking a reasonable balance between safeguarding national security and protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.""

   ""In fact, the HKSAR has a solid, resilient foundation of the rule of law that is well-recognised by the international community. The law enforcement agencies of the HKSAR have been strictly taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and in accordance with the law. The Department of Justice of the HKSAR, by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law, controls criminal prosecutions, free from any interference. Independent prosecutorial decisions for each case are made in a rigorous and objective manner, strictly based on evidence and applicable laws and are in accordance with the Prosecution Code. Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law specifically provide that the HKSAR enjoys independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication, and the courts of the HKSAR shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the occupation, political stance or background of the persons involved. In addition, Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security, including the principles of conviction and punishment only by the application of the law, the presumption of innocence, the prohibition of double jeopardy, and the right to defend oneself and other rights in judicial proceedings that a criminal suspect, defendant and other parties in judicial proceedings are entitled to under the law.""

   ""It is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. The HKNSL and the SNSO clearly define the elements and penalties of the related offences endangering national security, precisely targeting an extremely small minority of people and organisations committing in acts and activities that endanger national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public. Law abiding persons will not engage in acts and activities that endanger national security and will not unwittingly violate the law, and therefore have no reason to be concerned. As a matter of fact, since the promulgation and implementation of the HKNSL, stability has been quickly restored in society. With the SNSO in effect, the rights and freedoms of the HKSAR residents and of other persons in Hong Kong are even better protected while the economy of Hong Kong is picking up.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""Safeguarding national security is an ongoing and endless commitment. As mentioned in the 'White Paper on China's National Security in the New Era' published by the Central Authorities on May 12, 2025, external forces have meddled more in China's affairs, with an attempt to blockade, suppress and contain China through the so-called 'Hong Kong issues'. Today, as geopolitical risks continue to escalate, the HKSAR Government will strive steadfastly to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and improve the relevant legal system and enforcement mechanisms under the robust protection of the HKNSL and the SNSO, so as to address the evolving national security risks and challenges more effectively. We will also ramp up our efforts in publicity and education to arouse public awareness in safeguarding national security, thereby forming a societal shield to fend off external intervention, ensuring high-quality development with high-level security, continuously composing a new chapter in the practice of 'one country, two systems'.""

43rd batch of applications approved for trials of green transport technologies under New Energy Transport Fund,2025-06-30 10:00,2025-06-30 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025062600635.htm,"âThe Environment and Ecology Bureau today (June 30) announced its approval of the 43rd batch of applications for trials of green transport technologies under the New Energy Transport Fund.

The Steering Committee of the Fund has adopted a merit-based approach to assess applications for funding with a view to making the best use of the Fund and taking into account factors including the latest technology developments. One application has been approved in this batch (Note) for the trial of an electric heavy goods vehicle as an aircraft tractor, involving a total subsidy of $1.5 million.

The latest approval brings the total number of trials approved under the Fund to 296, with a total subsidy of about $242 million. As at end-May 2025, a total of 239 approved trials under the Fund have been completed. Trial reports have been uploaded to the Fund's website (www.eeb.gov.hk/en/new-energy-transport-fund/AT.html#Trial_Reports).

 As the technology of electric vehicles and batteries is becoming more mature, to allow the Fund to focus on subsidising new energy technologies with a more pressing need for trials in the local context in future, the Fund has only accepted applications for trials of new energy transport commercial tools other than electric commercial vehicles from April 1, 2025, with a view to expediting the green transformation of the transport trade.

 The Government put in place the Fund in March 2011 to subsidise the testing and encourage wider use of green transport technologies for a variety of commercial transport tools, such as goods vehicles (including special-purpose vehicles), taxis, light buses, buses, vessels, motorcycles, non-road vehicles (applicable to vehicle models approved by the Transport Department or the Airport Authority Hong Kong), or the aforesaid transport tools of charitable/non-profit making organisations providing services to their clients.

HKSAR Government responds to media enquiries on relaxation of import control measures on Japanese food products by the Mainland,2025-06-30 00:56,2025-06-30 01:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000054.htm,"In response to media enquiries about the relaxation of import control measures on Japanese food products by the Mainland, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government issued the following statement today (June 30):

The General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China issued on June 29, 2025 the ""Notice on Conditional Resumption of the Import of Aquatic Products from Certain Regions in Japan"" (the Notice), announcing that the import of some aquatic products of Japanese origin will be resumed with immediate effect, except for 10 metropolis/prefectures. According to the Notice, the import must comply with the relevant national laws and regulations, and food safety standards, and that the Japanese authority must effectively discharge its official regulatory responsibilities.

In response to the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water from Fukushima into the sea by the Japanese government, the HKSAR Government has since August 24, 2023 banned the import of aquatic products from 10 higher-risk metropolis/prefectures, including Tokyo, Fukushima, Chiba, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Gunma, Miyagi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, to safeguard food safety and protect public health in Hong Kong.

The duration and scale of the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station are unprecedented. Therefore, we must act in a prudent manner.

The HKSAR Government has been maintaining communication with the Japanese authority on the relevant issues, including requesting Japan to provide information on the latest development and scientific evidence concerning the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water, to assess whether there are conditions for relaxing the current precautionary measures. The HKSAR Government will make a public announcement if there is any policy adjustment."
特區政府回應傳媒查詢內地放寬日本食品進口管制措施,2025-06-30 00:17,2025-06-30 00:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/30/P2025063000035.htm,"​就傳媒查詢內地放寬日本食品進口管制措施一事，香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（六月三十日）發出以下聲明：

中華人民共和國海關總署在二○二五年六月二十九日作出《關於有條件恢復日本部分地區水產品進口的公告》，即日起恢復部分原產地為日本的水產品進口，十個都縣除外。公告亦提及，有關進口必須符合國家相關法律法規和食品安全標準，以及日方須有效履行官方監管責任。

特區政府因應日本福島核污水排放海洋計劃，為確保香港的食物安全和公眾健康，於二○二三年八月二十四日開始，禁止進口來自十個較高風險都縣的水產（包括東京、福島、千葉、栃木、茨城、群馬、宮城、新潟、長野和埼玉）。

福島核電站核污水排放的時間長度和規模是前所未有，因此，我們必需謹慎行事。

特區政府一直就有關問題與日方保持溝通，包括要求日本提供核污水排放的最新發展和科學證據，評核有否條件放寛現時採取的食物安全保障措施。如特區政府有政策調整，會作出公報。"
創新科技及工業局局長出席香港創科展2024-2025頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-06-29 18:28,2025-06-29 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/29/P2025062900560.htm,"​以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（六月二十九日）在香港創科展2024-2025頒獎典禮的致辭：

Daryl（香港創新基金主席黃永光）、Regina（行政會議非官守議員召集人葉劉淑儀議員）、萬寧副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室青年工作部副部長）、Mr David Taji（日內瓦國際發明展評審團主席 Mr David Taji-Farouki） 、各位評審、各位嘉賓、各位校長、老師、同學：

大家下午好！我非常高興再次出席由香港創新基金主辦的香港創科展2024-2025頒獎典禮。今年的創科展已經來到第四屆，我感謝大會的悉心籌備，讓本屆活動延續過往的活力與創意，為更多的學生搭建一個向大眾展現創意和追求科學卓越的舞台。

今天，日內瓦發明展的評審主席Mr Taji Farouki再次親臨現場支持香港創科展，now please allow me to say a few words to David. David, I am so happy to see you again in today’s event. Thank you so much for your continuous support to Hong Kong’s innovation and technology development. I am confident that you are impressed by our young generation on their innovation and enthusiasm. I wish you a pleasant experience in today’s event and a wonderful stay in Hong Kong!

今年大會一共接獲近600份參賽作品，踴躍程度為歷年之冠。剛才我在參觀展區的時候，也深深感受到同學們的創意與熱情。今年的作品很多都聚焦社會需求，例如幫助弱勢群體的智能裝置、提升生活便利的環保設計，以及運用人工智能解決實際問題的方案，你們的作品不僅貼合「大想頭齊創新」的主題，同時充分體現了「科技向善」的理念。同學們將課堂所學到的科學知識與現實生活中的觀察相結合，並通過多次測試，把理論、數據和創新意念轉化為實體應用方案，這正是一個創科夢想由萌芽到茁壯的過程。

任何創新產品都必須通過嚴格的專業驗證和標準測試，才能推出市場並獲得消費者信任。今年創科展特別增設的「檢測和認證專項獎」正好加強學生理解檢測和認證在創科過程中的角色及重要性，希望同學們在激發創意的同時，將控制質量和標準的觀念融入設計當中，同時要注重產品的可靠性和安全性，以體現科技發展中「以人為本」的核心價值。我看到現場許多同學的作品已經展現出商品化的潛力，希望你們能繼續努力加以優化，讓創新意念真正服務社會。

香港正全速全力發展成為國際創新科技中心，特區政府在《香港創新科技發展藍圖》明確提出普及創科文化為八大發展策略之一。很多人覺得創科是科學家、研究員和科技專家的事，但其實創科也可以很「貼地」，與你我的日常生活也息息相關。我們希望通過更多像香港創科展的創科盛事和科普活動，提升社會的創新氛圍，並為年輕人提供一個讓創意萌芽生根的平台。

在此，我要特別感謝所有指導老師和家長，你們的支持和鼓勵是同學們不斷前進的動力。各位同學，創科之路充滿挑戰，但也充滿無限可能。請謹記：科技可以改變世界，而科技由你們掌握。希望你們保持這份衝勁和好奇心，繼續探索、不斷突破，為香港乃至全球的創科發展貢獻力量。

最後，我祝賀所有得獎隊伍，也感謝每一位參與的同學、老師和家長。讓我們攜手努力，共同書寫香港創科的新篇章。多謝大家！"
