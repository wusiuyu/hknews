政制及內地事務局局長在立法會《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》委員會會議開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-23 11:26,2025-07-23 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300293.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（七月二十三日）在立法會《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》委員會會議的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

十分感謝陳勇主席今日召開法案委員會首次會議，審議《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》）。這份草案充分展示特區政府的堅定立場：一是恪守司法裁決的積極義務責任、二是捍衞我們傳統婚姻的堅定立場、三是致力平衡社會整體利益的管治擔當。

首先，正如我在二讀《條例草案》時表示，特區政府堅決維護法治的決心從不動搖。按照終審法院的裁決，政府有積極義務，須於兩年內建立替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，並制定伴隨的適當權利和責任。這份《條例草案》正是我們充分展示對法治的堅守，從不因為議題具爭議性而有所動搖。《條例草案》的目的十分清晰，就是設立一個替代框架，使同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，保障其私生活權利不受侵擾，同時制定承認同性伴侶關係而賦予的核心權利和責任。

特區政府深切明白部分議員與市民的憂慮，擔心《條例草案》若獲得通過，將衝擊「一夫一妻、一男一女」的傳統婚姻制度。我在此再次鄭重重申：特區的婚姻自由僅限於異性結合，這是《基本法》和《香港人權法案》的明確規定，終審法院亦已作出清晰的裁決確認，絕沒有轉寰的餘地。而我們現時建議推出的同性伴侶關係登記機制，與目前的「一夫一妻、一男一女」婚姻制度絕不能混為一談。而作為負責任的政府，我們亦早已開宗明義表示，特區政府維護傳統婚姻的決心堅如磐石。

在履行積極義務的同時，特區政府亦積極尋求社會的最大公約數。終審法院明確表示，特區政府與立法機關在制定相關法律承認機制和所賦予的核心權利和義務時，絕對有彈性的酌情空間。而在精準對焦法院判詞所提及滿足同性伴侶的「基本社會需求」的同時，我們亦盡力避免任何可能觸及婚姻傳統制度受影響或引發社會重大爭議的情況。《條例草案》中建議所包含的權利，旨在解決同性伴侶在現實生活中因缺乏法律身分承認和保障而導致出現的重大困難，從而滿足他們的「基本社會需求」，而制定承認機制的登記必須條件亦是充分考慮了香港的實際情況、社會整體利益和公眾期望，取其平衡，盡量為各方所接受。

主席，以上我扼要重申了政府立法的因由和重要原則。提交《條例草案》是為了履行我們在終審法院裁決下的積極義務，並恪守香港核心的法治精神。我深信各位議員必定能夠以理性持平、實事求是的態度，專業審議《條例草案》，妥善落實我們在《香港人權法案》下的積極義務。我們歡迎委員就《條例草案》提出具體建議，以優化和完善方案。今日除了我和政制及內地事務局的同事外，亦有律政司的代表，我們樂意聽取各位委員的意見和建議，並解答各位委員就《條例草案》的關注和提問。

多謝主席。"
立法會二十二題：體育場館的減廢措施,2025-07-23 11:20,2025-07-23 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300287.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上江玉歡議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

第十五屆全國運動會（十五運會）將於本年十一月在粵港澳三地舉行，其一大亮點是深入踐行綠色辦賽理念，致力於打造全國運動會歷史上首屆碳中和賽事。然而，有意見認為啟德體育園（體育園）作為新落成的國際級旗艦場館，其減廢措施仍有進一步完善空間。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於體育園過去以保安為由，禁止觀眾於體育賽事攜帶任何容器入場，並拒絕提供重用杯，但據報在多場於該園舉行的大型體育賽事中，企業包廂及貴賓席卻出現各種禁攜容器，當局有否檢視為何出現標準不一的情況，以及未來會如何確保相關規定的公平性和一致性；

（二）鑑於有意見指出，體育園於本年四月舉辦演唱會期間容許觀眾攜帶塑料或硅膠水瓶及杯入場，但未有於舉辦體育活動期間實施有關安排，令本地及海外觀眾無所適從，（i）上述安排未有於不同類型活動統一實施的原因為何，以及（ii）政府會否要求體育園清晰界定實施上述安排的活動類別及具體理由；

（三）鑑於有意見認為本港在重用容器系統方面已有成熟經驗，很多大型商場、連鎖餐飲企業及多項大型活動（例如以往在香港大球場舉行的香港國際七人欖球賽）均成功實踐「以重用代替即棄」的安排，有效減少廢物量，而據悉體育園亦以「永續」（即致力融合有利於可持續發展的營運方案，並加強資源利用）作為其中一項核心價值，該園至今未推行重用容器系統的原因為何；及

（四）在十五運會中，香港賽區場館（包括體育園及其他賽事場地）將如何具體落實「綠色、共享、開放、廉潔」辦賽理念中的「綠色」元素，以打造出粵港澳大灣區具示範作用的十五運會場館？

答覆：

主席：

啟德體育園是香港歷來最大型的體育基建，對政府推動體育和盛事經濟的發展至為重要。在今年三月一日正式啟用後，啟德體育園已迅速成為多項大型體育和娛樂盛事的新據點。

啟德體育園有限公司（營運公司）致力為到園區參加大型體育和娛樂盛事的人士帶來良好體驗，繼續做好活動安排和場地保安等重要工作的同時，亦不斷優化園區的日常管理和運作，包括在園區推動環保低碳的措施等。

就江玉歡議員的提問，在諮詢環境保護署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）為確保舉辦大型活動時的安全和秩序，所有進入啟德體育園各個場地參加活動的人士必須遵守營運公司訂明的場地規則，以及因應活動主辦單位的需求而制定的入場條款，例如不可攜帶外來食品和飲料、長雨傘、玻璃或金屬容器等進入場館。所有入場觀眾，包括在包廂和嘉賓席的觀眾，都須遵守同樣的規則和條款。

個別活動的主辦單位可能會因應其活動的性質和安排，在營運公司的批准下在指定區域為主辦單位的嘉賓提供特別的餐飲安排。營運公司會在不影響活動安全的前提下考慮相關要求。特別餐飲安排亦只適用於指定區域，例如容許在包廂內使用玻璃杯；在指定區域以外，例如到包廂外相連觀眾席的範圍觀賞節目時，包廂使用者仍須遵守場地規則，包括不可使用玻璃杯。

（二）因應體育賽事和娛樂活動不同的性質和風險，營運公司為這兩個類別的活動訂明了不同的場地規則。

體育賽事的本質是競技性，當參賽隊伍相互較勁和對陣時，尤其在競爭激烈的情況下，球迷之間的互動較容易引發衝突。因此，觀眾在觀看體育賽事時一般不可攜帶任何容量的水瓶及容器（不論有否附帶蓋子）進入場館，目的是防止有人將水瓶或容器向場內其他觀眾或球員投擲，以確保場內人士的安全。事實上，香港另一個主要大型體育場地香港大球場和其他國際體育場館在進行體育賽事時亦有因應保安理由實施相類似的要求。

至於娛樂活動（如演唱會），由於不涉及參賽隊伍相互較勁和對陣，引發觀眾衝突的機會較低，營運公司和主辦單位一般會容許觀眾攜帶容量不超過600毫升的塑料或硅膠水瓶／杯入場，但不得附有瓶／杯蓋及任何液體。

營運公司在大型活動舉行前會透過營運公司的網頁和其他方式（如社交媒體、新聞稿或主辦單位的活動指南）發放該活動相應的場地規則和入場條款，讓準備到場的觀眾清楚了解有關安排，並提前做好準備。營運公司過去亦有解釋不同入場規則的詳情和考慮。

（三）營運公司積極推動可持續發展，在確保安全、衞生和高效營運的前提下，多管齊下配合政府推動環保的工作。

在秉持惜物減廢和資源循環的目標下，啟德體育園內設置廢物分類和回收設施，並安裝廢物分解系統，把廚餘、紙杯及其他紙製容器轉化為堆肥材料，轉化的堆肥材料全數可用於園區內各處的植物作施肥之用，體現綠色管理和資源循環再用的理念。為進一步推動環保，營運公司在場館內使用的紙杯均屬經環保認證的可降解紙杯，一方面推動「走塑」文化和減少觀眾使用塑膠餐具，另一方面能保障衞生標準，提升觀眾體驗。

在制定上述場館管理措施時，營運公司已進行研究，並參考香港和其他地區的做法。就使用可重用塑膠容器的建議，營運公司詳細考慮後認為運送和清洗可重用容器等過程會產生額外的碳排放及運用其他資源，加上重用塑膠容器不可降解，既不能「走塑」，亦削弱了啟德體育園推動減碳和資源循環再用的效果；而使用可降解紙杯則能充分配合和善用上文解釋的啟德體育園廢物分解系統，整體的減碳效果相對較佳。

文化體育及旅遊局和環境保護署將繼續與營運公司保持緊密聯繫，讓參與啟德體育園大型活動的觀眾在獲得良好體驗的同時，推動園區持續加強在環保方面的工作。

（四）為貫切「簡約、安全、精彩」的辦賽要求和「綠色、共享、開放、廉潔」的辦賽理念，粵港澳三地將共同努力為第十五屆全國運動會和全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會達致碳中和目標。全國運動會香港賽區統籌辦公室已就此制定「綠色全運」工作方案，並已聘請專業檢測機構，就建立碳中和架構與協作機制、碳排放測算與核算、推動公眾參與綠色推廣及碳補償與認證等方面開展相關的工作。香港賽區的綠色減碳措施包括：使用現有的體育設施及場地辦賽；在比賽場館進行節能減碳措施及使用更多可再生能源，如塗上無電製冷塗層及安裝太陽能板等，以減少場館的耗電；倡導綠色出行及透過贊助取得新能源汽車提供接送服務；推廣綠色住宿；加強使用電子渠道宣傳及電子工具作文件分享，以推廣無紙化辦賽；加強分類和回收固體廢物；以及在比賽場地設置綠色及環保的展覽和遊戲，以推廣及介紹綠色全運的辦賽理念。"
立法會九題：優化輸入勞工政策,2025-07-23 11:20,2025-07-23 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300276.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上周小松議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

關於優化輸入勞工政策，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據報有僱主透過「假招聘」（例如在面試後以不符合要求拒絕聘用合適的本地求職者）營造「本地請不到人」的假象，以便其向政府申請輸入勞工，亦有不良僱主透過各種方式剝削其聘請的輸入勞工而出現「廉價外勞」問題，有意見指出該等違規做法嚴重影響本地工友就業，政府會否考慮設立黑名單制度，定期公布查明屬實違反輸入勞工規定的公司資料（包括公司名稱、所屬行業、違規事項的性質和日期、涉及的輸入勞工計劃及當局的跟進行動等），以加強監察和提高阻嚇力；

（二）會否研究設立行政罰款制度的可行性，向違反輸入勞工相關規定（包括聘用輸入勞工後，便減少本地員工的工時或將其解僱等）的僱主處以嚴厲罰款，以增強阻嚇力；

（三）鑑於有意見指出目前「補充勞工優化計劃」的常見職位表內部分工種（特別是飲食業工種）的每月中位工資均低於市場水平，或會拖低從事相關工種的本地工友工資，甚至削弱僱主聘用本地工友的意欲，當局會否檢視和優化釐定該職位表內工資中位數水平的方法，使有關水平更能貼近市場水平；

（四）鑑於有意見認為政府統計處定期發布有關本地勞工市場的統計數字（包括勞動人口數目、失業率、就業不足率、就業人士的每月就業收入等）未有將輸入勞工的數據分開處理，以致該等統計數字難以有效反映輸入勞工政策對本地勞動市場（包括本地工友就業和薪酬）的影響，當局會否探討定期統計並發布已撇除輸入勞工因素的相關勞工市場數字；及

（五）會否考慮定期主動公布輸入勞工的數據（包括按輸入勞工計劃類別、行業和工種劃分的申請、獲批和已到港工作的輸入勞工數目，以及聘用輸入勞工的企業數目和其名稱、所涉行業和聘請本地僱員與輸入勞工人數），以便社會更好地了解輸入勞工政策的推行情況？

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，政府適度容許僱主申請輸入勞工。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九‍月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，為期兩年。

就議員的提問，經諮詢政府統計處後，現答覆如下：

（一）及（二）為保障本地勞工優先就業，優化計劃的申請僱主必須先進行四星期本地公開招聘，以不低於市場相類職位的每月工資中位數，優先聘請合資格的本地工人填補空缺。僱主完成本地招聘程序後，須向勞工處匯報結果並遞交招聘廣告作核對。勞工處會聯繫每名不獲聘用的本地求職者，了解面試詳情，並確定僱主匯報不聘用的原因是否與事實相符及合理，從而評估僱主是否有誠意聘用本地工人。如有證據顯示僱主違反本地招聘的規定，或無合理理由拒絕聘用合資格的本地求職者，勞工處會中止處理有關申請。勞工處亦會向僱主施加行政制裁，拒絕處理有關僱主在隨後一年提交的其他申請。同時，獲批准輸入勞工的僱主，必須與輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約，並支付不低於相類職位中位工資的薪金，防止輸入勞工成為廉價勞工，損害本地工人的就業機會。

由今年六月十七日起，勞工處實施一系列加強保障本地工人優先就業的新措施，包括在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴；在「互動就業服務」網站刊登優化計劃本地招聘的職位空缺資料時，展示申請公司名稱，提高本地招聘的資訊透明度；進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例二比一的規定；按違規風險，要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例；以及拒絕處理同一僱主在遞交申請後六個月內提交的其他申請等。此外，勞工處於七月推出額外措施，加強監察申請僱主進行本地招聘的安排，確保本地招聘過程公正和真誠。

優化計劃亦規定僱主不得以輸入勞工取代在職的本地僱員。如需裁員，僱主應先裁減輸入勞工。如有足夠證據證明僱主違反有關規定，勞工處會作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准、拒絕處理僱主其後兩年的輸入勞工申請等。

輸入勞工待遇方面，政府高度重視保障他們的僱傭權益。輸入勞工同樣受香港勞工法例的保障，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括要求僱主及輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約，規定工資以自動轉帳方式直接存入輸入勞工的香港銀行戶口；突擊巡查輸入勞工的工作場所；舉辦僱傭權益簡介會確保輸入勞工了解其僱傭權益等。對於輸入勞工懷疑被剝削事件，政府已成立跨部門專責小組跟進，調查是否涉及刑事成分。如有足夠證據，執法部門會作出檢控行動。此外，勞工處於今年一月推出「輸入勞工支援計劃」，加強向懷疑被剝削的輸入勞工提供支援，包括個案諮詢、跟進及輔導，協助被僱主解僱的輸入勞工安排臨時住宿及申領相關津貼等。

（三）經諮詢相關政府決策局／部門／培訓機構／專業團體及參考優化計劃較常審理的申請職位資料，勞工處編製優化計劃下的常見職位表（包括相關職位的職責範圍、學歷要求、年資、每日正常工作時數及每月中位工資），當中每月中位工資主要由政府統計處在指定統計月份內就相關在職勞動人口所賺取的工資資料而釐定。勞工處會繼續密切留意本地勞工市場及相關數據，持續檢視優化計劃的運作和實施安排，致力保障本地工人優先就業。

（四）政府統計處通過定期進行抽樣統計調查，編製及發布本港勞動人口、就業、失業及就業不足等勞工統計數字，反映整體勞動人口（包括在港的輸入勞工）的最新狀況。由於在港的輸入勞工只佔本港勞動人口極少數，相關細分數字存在很大的抽樣誤差，考慮到統計數字的準確性，難以分拆輸入勞工的因素獨立發布。

（五）政府定期向勞工顧問委員會匯報輸入勞工計劃的實施情況和相關數據，並繼續密切留意本地勞工市場及各行業人力情況的變化，持續檢視各行業輸入勞工計劃及優化計劃的運作和實行安排，確保保障本地工人優先就業的措施得以落實。"
LCQ9: Improving labour importation policy,2025-07-23 11:20,2025-07-23 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300280.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chau Siu-chung and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

 Regarding the improvement of labour importation policy, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it has been reported that some employers have engaged in ""bogus recruitment"" (e.g. rejecting suitable local job seekers after interviews on the grounds that they do not meet the requirements) in order to create the false impression of difficulties in local recruitment, so as to justify applications to the Government for labour importation, while some unscrupulous employers have exploited the imported labour they employed through various means, resulting in the issue of ""cheap imported labour"", and there are views pointing out that such non-compliant practices severely undermine employment opportunities for local workers, whether the Government will consider establishing a blacklist system to regularly publish information on companies involved in substantiated cases of violation of labour importation regulations (including company names, the industries to which they belong, nature and dates of violations, the labour importation schemes involved, and follow-up actions taken by the authorities), so as to enhance monitoring and increase deterrence;

(2) whether it will study the feasibility of introducing an administrative penalty system to impose heavy fines on employers who violate regulations related to imported labour (including reducing the working hours of local employees or dismissing them after recruiting imported labour) in order to enhance deterrence;

(3) as there are views pointing out that the median monthly wages for some job categories (particularly those in the catering industry) on the List of Common Posts under the current Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme are below market levels, which may bring down the wages for local workers in related job categories and even discourage employers from recruiting local workers, whether the authorities will review and refine the methodology for determining the median wage levels on the List to better align them with market levels;

(4) as there are views that local labour market statistics (including size of labour force, unemployment rate, underemployment rate and monthly employment earnings of employed persons) regularly published by the Census and Statistics Department do not process data on imported labour separately, making it difficult for such statistics to effectively reflect the impact of labour importation policy on the local labour market (including the employment and wages of local workers), whether the authorities will consider regularly compiling and publishing relevant labour market statistics that exclude the factor of imported labour; and

(5) whether the authorities will consider proactively and regularly publishing statistics on imported labour (including the numbers of applications, approvals and arrivals to Hong Kong for work, broken down by labour importation scheme, industry and job category, as well as the number and names of enterprises employing imported labour, the industries involved, and the number of local employees and imported workers), so that society can better understand the implementation of the labour importation policy?

Reply:

President,

 To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, the Government suitably allows employers to apply for importation of workers. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme for two years.

 In consultation with the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) To safeguard employment priority for local workers, applicant employers of the ESLS must undertake a four-week local open recruitment and accord priority to employing qualified local workers to fill the job vacancies at a salary not lower than the prevailing median monthly wage of a comparable position in the market. Upon completion of the local recruitment procedures, employers shall report the results and submit recruitment advertisements to the LD for verification. The LD will contact each of the unsuccessful local job seekers to verify the interview details and confirm if the reasons for not employing the job seekers as reported by the employers are consistent with the facts and reasonable, so as to assess whether the employers have sincerity in recruiting local workers. If there is evidence showing that an employer has violated the requirements of local recruitment or refused to employ qualified local job seekers without reasonable grounds, the LD will terminate the processing of the relevant application. The LD will also impose administrative sanction on the employer and refuse to process any other application(s) submitted by the employer concerned in the following year. In parallel, employers approved to import workers are required to sign a Standard Employment Contract (SEC) with imported workers, and shall pay a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position to prevent the imported workers from becoming ""cheap labour"" and undermining the employment opportunities of local workers.

 Since June 17 this year, the LD has implemented a series of new measures to strengthen the protection of the employment priority for local workers, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers for suspected breaches of the requirements of the ESLS, displaying the names of applicant companies when publishing job vacancies for local recruitment under the ESLS on the Interactive Employment Service website to increase the information transparency of local recruitment, launching a special inspection campaign to check whether establishments employing imported workers have continuously met the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1, requiring employers to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach, and refusing to process other application(s) submitted by the same employer within six months after the employer submitted an application under the ESLS. Besides, the LD launched additional measures in July to strengthen monitoring of employers' local recruitment arrangements to ensure fairness and authenticity in the local recruitment process.

 The ESLS also requires employers not to displace local workers with imported workers. In the event of redundancy, imported workers should be retrenched first. If there is sufficient evidence substantiating violation of the relevant requirements, the LD will impose administrative sanction, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process applications for labour importation submitted by the employer in the following two years.

 With regard to the treatment of imported workers, the Government attaches great importance to protecting their employment rights and benefits. Imported workers also enjoy the protection of labour laws in Hong Kong. The Government adopts a multi-pronged strategy, including requiring employers and imported workers to sign the SEC, requiring that wages be paid directly into imported workers' bank accounts in Hong Kong by automatic payment, conducting surprise inspections to workplaces of imported workers, and organising briefings on employment rights to ensure imported workers understand their employment rights and benefits. For cases of suspected exploitation of imported workers, the Government has set up an inter-departmental task force to follow up and investigate whether criminal elements are involved. If there is sufficient evidence, law enforcement agencies will take out prosecution. In addition, the LD launched the Imported Workers Support Scheme in January this year to strengthen support for imported workers who are suspected of being exploited, including case consultation, follow-up and guidance, as well as assisting imported workers whose employment has been terminated by their employers to arrange temporary accommodation and apply for relevant subsidies.

(3) In consultation with relevant government bureaux/ departments/ training bodies/ professional organisations and making reference to details of the applied posts commonly processed under the ESLS, the LD complies the List of Common Posts under the ESLS (including the scope of duties, academic requirements, years of experience, normal working hours per day, and median monthly wages of relevant posts). Among others, the median monthly wages are mainly determined by the C&SD's data of wages earned by relevant employed labour force in the specified survey reference month. The LD will continue to closely monitor the local labour market and relevant statistics, and continuously review the operation and implementation arrangements of the ESLS, striving to safeguard the employment priority for local workers.

(4) To reflect the latest conditions of the overall labour force (including imported workers in Hong Kong), the C&SD conducts regular sample surveys to compile and disseminate statistics on the labour force, employment, unemployment and underemployment, etc, in Hong Kong. As imported workers in Hong Kong only constitute a very small proportion of the labour force, the relevant breakdowns will have significant sampling error. Taking into account the accuracy of the statistics, it is difficult to segregate the factor of imported workers and publish the statistics separately.

(5) The Government reports regularly to the Labour Advisory Board on the implementation and relevant statistics of the labour importation schemes, and will continue to closely monitor changes in the local labour market and the manpower situation of different industries, and from time to time review the operation and implementation arrangements of the sector-specific labour importation schemes and the ESLS to ensure measures for safeguarding employment priority for local workers are implemented."
LCQ22: Waste reduction measures in sports stadiums,2025-07-23 11:20,2025-07-23 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300290.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Doreen Kong and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

The 15th National Games (NG) will be held in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao in November this year. One of the key highlights of the Games is the thorough implementation of green initiatives in organising the event, and the endeavour to make it the first carbon-neutral event in the history of NG. However, there are views that the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP), which is a newly-opened international flagship stadium, still has room for improvement in its waste reduction measures. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the KTSP previously prohibited audience from bringing any containers into sport events for security reasons and declined to provide reusable cups, but it has been reported that various types of prohibited containers were found in the corporate boxes and VIP seats during several major sport events held in the Park, whether the authorities have reviewed why there were such inconsistencies in the standards, and how they will ensure the fairness and consistency in the relevant requirements in the future;

(2) as there are views pointing out that while the KTSP allowed audience to bring plastic or silicone water bottles and cups into the venue during concerts held in April this year, relevant arrangements were not made for sport events which had left local and overseas audience at a loss, (i) of the reasons why the aforesaid arrangements were not implemented consistently for different types of events, and (ii) whether the Government will request the KTSP to clearly define the types of events for which the aforesaid arrangements are to be implemented and the specific justifications;

(3) as there are views that Hong Kong has mature experience in reusable container systems, and that the arrangement of ""reuse instead of disposal"" has been successfully implemented in many large shopping centres, restaurant chains and major events (e.g. the Hong Kong Sevens held at the Hong Kong Stadium in the past), which are effective in reducing the amount of waste, and it is learnt that the KTSP has also adopted ""sustainability"" (i.e. striving to integrate operational solutions conducive to sustainable development, and optimising resource usage) as one of its core values, of the reasons for not implementing the reusable container systems in the KTSP so far; and

(4) how the stadiums in Hong Kong (including the KTSP and other competition venues) will specifically implement the element of green initiatives under the principles of ""green, inclusive, open and clean"" during the 15th NG, so as to create exemplary venues for the 15th ‍NG in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area?

Reply:

President,

The Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is the largest sports infrastructure in HongKong's history and is crucial for the Government's promotion of the development of sports and mega event economy. With its official commissioning on March 1 this year, the KTSP has quickly established itself as a new hub for hosting major sports and entertainment events.

The Kai Tak Sports Park Limited (the Operator) is committed to providing an enjoyable experience for visitors attending major sports and entertainment events at the KTSP. While ensuring proper implementation of areas of importance such as event arrangements and venue security, the Operator is also dedicated to optimising the daily management and operations of the KTSP, including promoting environmentally friendly and low-carbon measures.

In consultation with the Environmental Protection Department (EPD), my reply to the questions raised by the Hon Doreen Kong is as follows:

(1) To ensure safety and order when staging large-scale events, all visitors entering the venues of the KTSP must comply with the venue rules set out by the Operator, as well as the conditions of entry stipulated in response to the requirements of event organisers. For instance, outside food and drinks, long umbrellas, glass or metal containers etc, are prohibited from being brought into the venues. All spectators, including those in suites and VIP areas, must adhere to the same rules and conditions.

Depending on the nature and arrangements of the event, individual organisers may arrange for special catering services for their guests in designated areas, subject to the Operator's approval. The Operator will consider such requests provided that they do not affect the safety of the events. Such special catering services will apply to designated areas only. For example, the use of glass containers is only allowed inside the suite area. When enjoying the event at the balcony seats of the suite, suite users still need to follow the same venue rules, including the prohibition on using glass containers.

(2) In view of the varying nature and risks between sports and entertainment events, the Operator has established different venue rules for the two event categories.

The essence of sports events is competitiveness. When competing teams are battling against each other, especially in intense situations, the interaction among the fans could more easily lead to confrontations. Therefore, spectators at sports events are generally not allowed to bring water bottles or containers of any size (whether capped or not) into the venues so as to prevent such bottles or containers from being thrown at other spectators or players, thereby ensuring the safety of everyone inside the venue. In fact, another major sports venue in Hong Kong, namely the Hong Kong Stadium, as well as other international sports stadiums also stipulate similar requirements during sports events for security reasons.

For entertainment events (such as concerts), since there is no competition between battling teams, the likelihood of conflict among the audience is lower. The Operator and event organisers generally allow spectators to bring empty plastic or silicone reusable bottles/cups not larger than 600millilitres with bottle/cups caps and liquids removed.

The Operator will disseminate relevant rules and conditions of entry through its website and other channels (such as social media, press releases, or event guides from the organisers) before the staging of large-scale events to ensure that spectators are well-informed to facilitate their preparation in advance. The Operator has indeed explained the details and considerations of different rules and entry conditions in past events.

(3) The Operator is dedicated to promoting sustainable development. While ensuring safety, hygiene and effective operations, the Operator has been collaborating with the Government to promote environmental protection through a multi-pronged approach.

Adhering to the objectives of ""Use Less, Waste Less"" and resources circulation, the KTSP has placed waste separation and recycling facilities as well as installed a waste decomposition system to convert food waste, paper cups, and other paper containers into compostable materials. All the compost produced can be used as fertiliser for plants within the precinct, showcasing the concepts of green management and resources circulation. To further promote environmental protection, all paper cups used by the Operator in the KTSP are certified biodegradable. This promotes a plastic-free culture, reducing the use of plastic tableware by spectators on one hand, while helping to maintain hygiene standards and enhance audience experience on the other.

The Operator has conducted research and made reference to practices in Hong Kong and other regions when formulating the above venue management measures. On the suggestion of using reusable plastic containers, after careful consideration, the Operator concluded that the processes involved in transporting and cleaning these reusable containers would generate additional carbon emissions and consume other resources. In addition, as reusable plastic containers are not biodegradable, they do not support the plastic-free initiative and undermine the KTSP's efforts in promoting carbon reduction and resources circulation. In contrast, the use of biodegradable paper cups aligns well with and makes good use of the above-mentioned waste decomposition system at the KTSP, leading to a better overall carbon reduction outcome.

The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the EPD will continue to maintain close communication with the Operator to further promote environmental protection work at the KTSP, while ensuring that spectators attending major events continue to have an enjoyable experience.

(4) To adhere to the principle of ""simple, safe and wonderful"", and the philosophy of being ""green, inclusive, open and clean"" in organising the Games, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao will make joint efforts in achieving the goal of carbon neutrality for the 15th National Games, the 12thNational Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympics Games. The National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) has formulated a ""Green National Games"" action plan and engaged a professional carbon auditing agency to carry out the related works such as establishing a carbon-neutral framework and collaborative initiatives, conducting comprehensive carbon emission measurement and accounting, promoting public participation in green initiatives and managing carbon offset and certification. The green and carbon-reduction measures in Hong Kong include using existing sports facilities and venues for the Games; implementing energy-saving strategies and increasing renewable energy use at competition venues (for example, applying electricity-free cooling coating and installing solar panels); advocating green transportation and securing new energy vehicles for shuttle services through sponsorship; promoting environmentally friendly accommodation; strengthening the use of digital publicity and document sharing to minimise paper use; enhancing waste separation and recycling; and setting up green exhibitions and games at competition venues to promote the concept of ""Green National Games""."
​立法會十一題：免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照的機制,2025-07-23 11:15,2025-07-23 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300266.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上林順潮議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

根據目前法例，持有認可國家或地區簽發的海外駕駛執照的人士，可無須通過本地駕駛考試，獲直接簽發香港正式駕駛執照（免試簽發駕駛執照）。據報近日有「排隊黨」公然在運輸署香港牌照事務處（該牌照處）附近及社交平台（例如小紅書等）兜售免試簽發駕駛執照代辦服務，並有人清早在該牌照處輪候領取即日籌號後轉讓，懷疑濫用服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述代辦服務是否違法；

（二）有否檢視現行法例是否足以打擊上述懷疑濫用服務及轉讓籌號的行為；如有，詳情為何；

（三）政府將採用甚麼方法打擊上述懷疑濫用服務及轉讓籌號的行為，包括會否考慮在社交平台（例如小紅書）或該牌照處進行「放蛇」行動；如會，詳情為何；及

（四）鑑於目前免試簽發駕駛執照有龐大需求，當局會否考慮優化現行的派籌機制或申請流程（包括現時網上預約服務系統），以縮短申請者的等候時間並提升整體效率？

答覆：

主席：

運輸署按照《道路交通（駕駛執照）規例》（第374B章）（《規例》）第11（3）條的規定執行免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照（「免試簽發」），讓持有由《規例》附表4載列的32個國家和地方（認可國家或地方）所簽發的駕駛執照的人士，在符合指定條件下，可無須通過本地駕駛考試而獲直接簽發香港正式駕駛執照，以駕駛私家車、輕型貨車、電單車及／或機動三輪車。

根據《規例》，在申請「免試簽發」時，有關認可國家或地方簽發的駕駛執照必須仍然有效或有效期屆滿不超過三年，以及是申請人在簽發國家或地方經成功完成有關的駕駛考試後而獲得的。此外，申請人必須年滿十八歲，並符合以下其中一項條件：（1）持有的駕駛執照是申請人在簽發國家或地方居住不少於六個月的期間發出；或（2）在緊接申請前申請人已持有該認可國家或地方的駕駛執照不少於五年；或（3）申請人持有該駕駛執照簽發國家或地方的護照或同等的旅行證件。

就林順潮議員的問題各部分，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）至（三）為便利市民，如同其他牌證申請服務，運輸署接受「免試簽發」申請人按需要選擇親身或委託代理人（包括家人、朋友等）遞交申請及證明文件。為符合《規例》下就「免試簽發」的資格要求，不論是申請人或其代理人均須在遞交申請時提供多項真實及準確的相關證明文件正本（包括認可國家或地方發出的有效駕駛執照、申請人護照／其他旅遊證件、居住證明或駕駛執照細節證明書等證明文件），供運輸署職員即場審核。運輸署一直以嚴謹的方式處理申請，確保每份獲批的申請均屬正確。

現時，「免試簽發」申請人可經網上預約或在牌照事務處領取即日籌以使用櫃位服務，遞交申請文件。有關領取即日籌方面，為維持輪候秩序，運輸署已進一步派員加強巡查，並增設圍欄分隔輪候「免試簽發」籌號及其他一般駕駛執照服務籌號的人士，和劃分指定輪候位置。此外，就「免試簽發」，該署會指明輪候籌號次序，以防止插隊等情況。運輸署一直有張貼告示，及派職員及保安人員在場提供適切協助。如發現有影響公共秩序的行為，會交由警務處跟進。

為加強核對取籌人士身分，運輸署已提升即日籌的派籌系統，確保使用同一身分證明文件的人士在每一個時段只可取一籌。櫃位人員會嚴格核對使用者的身分證明文件號碼，確保取籌人士與櫃位服務使用者為同一人，以阻截籌號轉讓。如發現有違規轉讓，所有相關籌號即告無效，申請概不受理。

為針對有部分人士在領取即日籌後兜售代辦服務，運輸署將於二○二五年八月中起再進一步優化派籌系統。屆時，所有取籌人士於輸入其個人身分證明文件號碼之餘，亦須同時輸入「免試簽發」申請者的身分證明文件號碼，而有關資料會列印於籌號上。使用櫃位服務時，櫃位職員將核對該籌號的持有人及申請人的身分證明文件號碼。如任何身分證明文件號碼與籌號上列印的不符，該籌號即告無效，有關申請亦不獲受理。有關優化安排可遏止任何人在取籌後憑籌號兜攬生意。運輸署會於網頁公布有關派籌輪候系統的最新運作安排，並會透過社交媒體公布有關信息。運輸署人員會在場張貼告示，並會安排向在場的市民提供協助。

（四）運輸署一直非常關注輪候取籌及網上預約的情況，並採取針對性的優化措施。除上述關於即日籌的優化安排外，在網上預約方面，運輸署將加強與有關駕駛執照簽發機構的合作，例如由二○二五年九月起查核經網上預約提供的內地駕駛證的申請人資料，如發現資料不真確，有關網上預約將會被取消，名額會重新開放予其他申請人預約。有關措施可確保提升系統有效運作。

運輸署會持續檢視上述優化措施的成效，適時調整相關安排，並繼續推動牌證服務電子化，從而調動更多櫃位辦理如「免試簽發」等必須經櫃位處理的申請。"
LCQ11: Mechanism of direct issue of Hong Kong full driving licence,2025-07-23 11:15,2025-07-23 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300268.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Dennis Lam and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

Under the existing legislation, a person holding an overseas driving licence issued by a recognised country or place may be directly issued with a Hong Kong full driving licence without taking a local driving test (direct issue of driving licence). It has been reported that queuing gangs have recently been blatantly offering facilitation service for direct issue of driving licence in the vicinity of the Hong Kong Licensing Office of the Transport Department (the Licensing Office) and on social media platforms (such as Xiaohongshu, etc), and some individuals have been transferring their same-day queue tickets after waiting in line early in the morning at the Licensing Office, raising suspicions of abuse of services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the aforementioned facilitation service is illegal;

(2) whether it has reviewed if the existing legislation is adequate in combating the suspected abuse of services and transfer of queue tickets as mentioned above; if so, of the details;

(3) of the measures the Government will adopt to combat the suspected abuse of services and transfer of queue tickets as mentioned above, including whether it will consider conducting decoy operations on social media platforms (such as Xiaohongshu) or at the Licensing Office; if so, of the details; and

(4) given the current significant demand for direct issue of driving licence, whether the authorities will consider optimising the existing ticket distribution mechanism or application process (including the existing system of online appointment booking for services), so as to shorten applicants' waiting time and enhance overall efficiency?

Reply:

President,

The Transport Department (TD) implements direct issue of a Hong Kong full driving licence without test (""direct issue"") in accordance with regulation 11(3) of the Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations (Cap. 374B) (the Regulations), which allows a person holding a driving licence issued by one of the 32 countries and places specified in the Fourth Schedule to the Regulations (recognised countries or places) to be directly issued with a Hong Kong full driving licence without taking a local driving test for driving private cars, light goods vehicles, motor cycles and/or motor tricycles, provided that specified conditions are met.

According to the Regulations, to apply for ""direct issue"", the driving licence issued by the relevant recognised country or place must still be valid or expired for not more than three years, and be obtained by the applicant after successful completion of a driving test conducted in the issuing country or place. Also, the applicant must be aged 18 years or above and meet one of the following requirements: (1) the driving licence held was issued during a period of the applicant's residence of not less than six months in the issuing country or place; or (2) the applicant has been holding the driving licence issued by the recognised country or place for not less than five years immediately prior to the application; or (3) the applicant is the holder of a passport or other equivalent travel document issued in the country or place in which the driving licence was issued.

A consolidated reply to the various parts of the question raised by Dr the Hon Dennis Lam is as follows:

(1) to (3) For the convenience of the general public, the TD, as in the case of other licensing services, allows applicants for ""direct issue"" to choose to submit their applications and supporting documents in person or by authorised persons (including family members, friends, etc) based on their own needs. To meet the eligibility criteria of ""direct issue"" under the Regulations, an applicant or his/her authorised person should, when submitting an application, produce the relevant original copies of various supporting documents which are authentic and accurate (including a valid driving licence issued by the recognised country or place, the applicant's passport/other travel document, proof of address or Certificate of Driving Licence Particulars, etc) for on-site inspection by TD staff. The TD has been processing the applications in a stringent manner to ensure that all applications are correctly approved.

Currently, applicants for ""direct issue"" may use counter services and submit application documents through making online appointments or obtaining same-day queue tickets at the Licensing Offices. As regards obtaining same-day queue tickets, in order to maintain the good order of queuing, the TD has further stepped up staff patrols, set up additional barriers to separate those queuing up for the tickets for ""direct issue"" and those for the tickets for general driving licensing services, and demarcated designated areas for queuing. In addition, in relation to ""direct issue"", the TD will specify the sequence of queuing tickets to prevent situations such as queue-jumping. The TD has been posting notices and deploying staff and security guards to provide on-site assistance as appropriate. Any acts found to be disrupting public order will be reported to the Hong Kong Police Force for follow-up.

To strengthen verification of the identity of queuers, the TD has enhanced the queue ticketing system for same-day queue tickets to ensure that a person using the same identification document (ID) can only obtain one queue ticket for each time slot. The counter staff will conduct strict checking of the ID number of the user and ascertain that the queuer is the one who uses the counter services, so as to curb transfer of queue tickets. Once an unauthorised transfer of queue ticket is found, all relevant queue tickets will become void immediately and the applications will not be processed.

To address the issue of individuals touting facilitation services after obtaining same-day queue tickets, the TD will further enhance the queue ticketing system from mid-August 2025, whereby all queuers will be required to input both the ID numbers of their own and those of the applicants for ""direct issue"", which will then be printed on the tickets. When a ticket holder uses the counter services, the counter staff will verify his/her ID numbers and those of the applicant. If either of these ID numbers does not match with those printed on the ticket, the ticket will become void and the application will not be processed. This enhanced arrangement will deter individuals from touting with the same-day queue tickets obtained. The TD will publicise the latest operational arrangement of the queue ticketing system on its website and announce the relevant information through social media. The TD staff will post notices on-site and provide assistance to members of the public at the venue.

(4) The TD has been highly concerned about the situation of queue ticketing and online appointments, and has implemented targeted enhancement measures. Apart from the aforementioned enhanced arrangements for same-day queue tickets, in terms of online appointments, the TD will strengthen its co-operation with the relevant issuers of driving licences. For example, starting from September 2025, applicants' information in relation to Mainland driving licences provided via online appointments will be checked. If the information is found to be untrue, the relevant online appointment will be cancelled and the quota will be reopened for appointment by other applicants. The relevant measures will ensure the enhancement of effective operation of the system.

The TD will keep in view of the effectiveness of the aforementioned enhancement measures and make timely adjustments to the relevant arrangements, as well as continue to promote the digitalisation of licensing services, thereby allocating more counters for processing applications which require counter services such as ""direct issue""."
立法會十五題：校外STEAM課程,2025-07-23 11:00,2025-07-23 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300281.htm,"以下是今日（七月二十三日）在立法會會議上黃錦輝議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉許多家長為子女報讀校外的STEAM（即科學、科技、工程、藝術和數學）課程，希望培養子女對相關學科的興趣。然而，有意見指出部分課程機構為了在同一節課多收學生，漠視不同年齡學生的學習能力差異，讓小一至小六的學生使用同一教材，教學成效成疑。此外，據報近日更有三歲幼童於校外機構參加STEAM興趣班時，在實驗過程中遭滾燙牛奶燙傷。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年當局接獲有關校外STEAM課程／興趣班的求助或投訴數目為何；該等求助或投訴的主要內容，以及當局的具體跟進措施為何；

（二）當局會否以《小學科學科安全手冊》、《科學實驗室安全手冊》等指引作參考，以制訂校外STEAM課程的安全管理規範；如會，具體規範標準及落實時間表為何；如否，當局會否盡快展開研究，提高校外STEAM課程的安全水平，以免再有意外發生；及

（三）當局是否已敲定為校外STEAM課程設立教師、教材及課程的認證制度，以及釐清學童參加該等課程的合適年齡；如是，具體認證標準及落實時間表為何；如否，當局會否盡快展開研究，為校外STEAM課程設立認證制度，以協助家長為子女選擇合適課程？

答覆：

主席：

根據《教育條例》第3（1）及第10條，任何院校、組織或機構，只要其於任何一天向20人或多於20人或於任何時間同時向八人或多於八人提供幼兒、幼稚園、小學、中學或專上教育或以任何方式提供任何其他教育課程，即須註冊或臨時註冊為學校。所有開辦補習班、商科、電腦、語文課程及重讀生課程等教育課程的私立學校，均屬於提供非正規課程的私立學校。而提供非正規課程的私立學校只要符合《教育（豁免）（提供非正規課程的私立學校）令》中所指明的條件，便可豁免於《教育條例》及《教育規例》中有關費用、僱用教員及教員資格、校長、假期及授課時間等條文的管限。

就黃錦輝議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）過去三年，教育局並沒有接獲有關接受提供正規課程學校以外的校外STEAM課程的求助或投訴個案。

（二）及（三）教育局編訂的《小學科學科安全手冊》和《科學實驗室安全手冊》，分別為小學科學科和中學科學實驗室的安全事宜提供參考和指引，協助學校在安排科學學習活動及實驗時，於安全管理、風險評估、器材存放等方面有所依循，以保障師生安全。除推行小學科學科及中學各科學科目課程的學校，其他提供非本地課程／非正規課程的註冊學校亦可參考這些指引文件。

非正規課程的私立學校多為接受正規學校教育的學生提供私營補習服務， 而這只是一種可供選擇而非絕對需要的服務。對於這類學校，教育局的工作重點是確保這些學校符合《教育條例》有關校舍安全、衞生、學生容額、師資及收費等方面的規定。因此，教育局並無意為這些非正規課程的私立學校所舉辦的STEAM課程設立認證制度。

惟須注意，所有學校在安排科學實驗活動時，均有責任確保遵行相關條例及規例，包括《教育規例》（尤其是第21、24、26、27、31、32及33條）、《教育條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》，以及有關危險品和化學廢物處置的規例。"
LCQ15: Off-school STEAM courses,2025-07-23 11:00,2025-07-23 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/23/P2025072300277.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Professor the Hon William Wong and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (July 23):

Question:

It is learnt that many parents have enrolled their children in STEAM (i.e. ‍Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) courses conducted outside of school, hoping to cultivate their children's interest in these relevant disciplines. However, there are views pointing out that, in order to increase enrolment within the same class sessions, certain course providers overlook the differences in learning abilities among students of varying ages and employ identical teaching materials for pupils from Primary One to Primary Six. Such practices call into question the effectiveness of teaching and learning. Furthermore, it has been reported that, in recent days, a three-year-old child participating in a STEAM interest class at an external organisation sustained scald injuries from hot milk in the course of an experiment. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of requests for assistance or complaints received by the authorities regarding off-school STEAM courses/interest classes over the past three years; the main subject matters of such requests and complaints, and the specific follow-up measures taken by the authorities;

(2) whether the authorities will formulate a safety management protocol for off-school STEAM courses by drawing reference from guidelines such as the Safety Handbook for Primary Science and the Handbook on Safety in Science Laboratories; if so, of the specific standards of such a protocol and the timetable for its implementation; if not, whether the authorities will expeditiously commence a study to enhance the safety standards for off-school STEAM courses so as to prevent further accidents; and

(3) whether the authorities have finalised an accreditation system for teachers, teaching materials and curricula to be established for off-school STEAM courses, and delineated the appropriate age ranges for students to participate in such courses; if so, of the specific accreditation standards and the implementation timetable; if not, whether the authorities will expeditiously commence a study to establish an accreditation system for off-school STEAM courses, with a view to assisting parents in choosing suitable courses for their children?

Reply:

President,

According to sections 3(1) and 10 of the Education Ordinance, any institution, organisation or establishment which provides for 20 or more persons during any one day or 8 or more persons at any one time, any nursery, kindergarten, primary, secondary or post secondary education or any other educational course by any means is required to be registered or provisionally registered as a school. Private schools which offer educational courses such as tutorial, commercial, computer, language courses and courses for repeaters are all categorised as private schools offering non-formal curriculum (PSNFCs). Subject to compliance with specified conditions under the Education (Exemption) Private Schools Offering Non-formal Curriculum) Order, PSNFCs are exempt from certain requirements of the provisions of Education Ordinance and Education Regulations relating to fees, employment of teachers and teachers' qualifications, principals, holidays and hours of instruction.

In response to Professor the Hon William Wong's questions, the reply is as follows:

(1) In the past three years, the Education Bureau (EDB) has not received any requests for assistance or complaints relating to participation in off-school STEAM courses provided by schools other than those offering formal curriculum.

(2) and (3) The Safety Handbook for Primary Science and Handbook on Safety in Science Laboratories, issued by the EDB, provide references and guidelines for safety matters of Primary Science and secondary science laboratories respectively. They assist schools, when arranging science learning activities and experiments, in aspects such as safety management, risk assessment, equipment storage, etc, so as to ensure the safety of teachers and students. In addition to schools implementing the Primary Science curriculum and secondary science subject curricula, other registered schools offering non-local/non-formal curricula may also refer to these guidelines.

PSNFCs mainly provide tutorial services to students receiving formal school education, which constitute an optional rather than mandatory service. For this type of school, the main role of the EDB is to ensure its compliance with the requirements on school premises safety, hygiene, accommodation, teachers' qualifications, and collection of fees under the Education Ordinance. In this connection, the EDB has no intention to set up a certification system for the STEAM courses offered by these PSNFCs.

It should be noted that all schools are responsible for ensuring compliance with relevant ordinances and regulations when arranging science activities and experiments, including the Education Regulations (particularly regulations 21, 24, 26, 27, 31, 32 and 33), the Education Ordinance, the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, and regulations related to dangerous goods and disposal of chemical waste."

According to the investigation, the unauthorised party had cyberattacked the system by making countless attempts at the mid-night of July 20 and the following day to access and retrieve information through the address book function of EC-Ship system. Hongkong Post had activated the blocking mechanism immediately after the abnormal activities being detected by its system and disabled the operation of the EC-Ship account which was involved in the cyberattacks at once. During the above-mentioned blockage and interception of these cyberattacks, the concerned accounts' address books information, including the senders' and recipients' person/company names, addresses, and/or phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses, was being accessed and retrieved.

Hongkong Post has sent emails to inform all affected account holders today and reminded them to remain vigilant, and to immediately inform relevant persons of their address books about this incident and remind them to be vigilant. The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) has initiated investigation into the incident and Hongkong Post will fully cooperate with the HKPF in the investigation, and will closely monitor the situation of the involved information.

Hongkong Post has been following established Government procedures on information and cybersecurity. The Digital Policy Office (DPO) is also in close communication with Hongkong Post on the incident, noting that it has taken immediate actions by promptly blocking the cyberattacks and enhancing the security measures of the system. The services concerned have resumed normal and account holders involved can continue to use the services.

The spokesman for Hongkong Post said that the global cybersecurity landscape was evolving, with various forms of cyberattacks emerging continuously. Hongkong Post would actively seek advice from the DPO to continuously enhance the cyber resilience level and cybersecurity risk management, to safeguard the information security of users and to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

Hongkong Post reiterates that it will not send embedded hyperlinks via emails, SMS messages or social media pages for collecting personal information or requesting for payment. Hongkong Post wishes to alert members of the public again to refrain from clicking on any embedded links or providing any personal or financial information such as credit card information, or making any payment to suspicious emails or SMS messages alleged to be sent by Hongkong Post.

勞工處發言人今日（七月二十二日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

如有任何有關職業安全及健康的問題，可致電2559 2297，與勞工處職業安全主任聯絡。"
"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-07-22 20:01,2025-07-22 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200798.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (July 22) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

 The case involves a 5-year-old girl with good past health. She developed fever, headache and vomiting on July 18 and sought medical attention from a private doctor on the following day. On July 21, she was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital and was admitted for treatment. She remains hospitalised.

 A laboratory test of her cerebrospinal fluid specimen was positive for EV. The clinical diagnosis was meningitis.

 Preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the patient had travelled to the Mainland with four travel collaterals during the incubation period. One of her travel collaterals developed a cough and runny nose on July 18 and sought medical attention from a private doctor, while the other travel collaterals remained asymptomatic. Her household contacts have remained asymptomatic for the time being. The CHP's investigation is ongoing.

 EV infection is transmitted by direct contact with the nasal and throat secretions of an infected person. Children with EV infection should stay at home until they have recovered to avoid infecting other children. The public should be vigilant and observe the following preventive measures:


Wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet and changing diapers;
Cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing;
Maintain good indoor ventilation; and
Thoroughly clean toys or appliances contaminated by nasal or oral secretions.

病人的腦脊液樣本經化驗後，證實對腸病毒呈陽性反應。臨床診斷為腦膜炎。

衞生防護中心初步調查顯示，病人於潛伏期內曾與四名同行人士到內地。其中一名同行人士於七月十八日出現咳嗽和流鼻水，並已向私家醫生求醫，而其他同行者暫時沒有出現病徵。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有出現病徵。中心正繼續調查個案。

腸病毒感染是透過直接接觸病人的鼻或喉嚨分泌而傳播，感染腸病毒的兒童應留在家中，直至病癒才可回校上課，以免感染其他兒童。市民亦應保持警覺和採取以下預防措施：


飯前、如廁後及處理嬰兒的尿片後，應徹底洗手；
咳嗽或打噴嚏時，應掩蓋鼻口；
保持室內空氣流通；及
玩具或用具如染有鼻或口腔分泌物，應徹底清洗乾淨。

The CHP will continue to work closely with the health authorities in Guangdong Province and Macao, and will take appropriate preventive and control measures according to risk assessment to prevent the spread of CF in Hong Kong and protect public health.

Collaboration of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao on disease prevention and control

""Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have been working closely in communicable disease prevention and control, emergency response, and the co-operation mechanism for disease prevention and control. Owing to the communicable disease notification mechanism established by the three places, the CHP has kept abreast of the latest situation of CF in Guangdong Province. Although no confirmed CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong so far this year, the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer is expected to aggravate mosquito infestation in Hong Kong. Additionally, people travel more frequently during summer holidays, including to regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Consequently, there is an increased risk of imported cases and local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases, such as CF and dengue fever. Members of the public are advised to take precautionary and personal protection measures against mosquitoes, both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Measures to cope with risk of importation of mosquito-borne disease

Dr Tsui added that, in order to cope with the risk of imported case of mosquito-borne disease, the CHP's Port Health Division has stepped up inspections at the boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. The Port Health Division also conducts temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever will be assessed on health conditions and referred to hospitals for follow up when necessary. The CHP will also maintain close liaison with relevant stakeholders, such as airlines and the travel industry, to provide the latest disease information and health advice in a timely manner.

In addition, the CHP has issued a letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel. If CF cases are detected, they should be immediately referred to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism, so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures.

In view of the recent outbreak of CF in neighbouring areas, the Hospital Authority (HA) has reminded healthcare professionals to be vigilant in early identification of patients for timely diagnosis and management of patients. Its hospitals and clinics have also been reminded to step up mosquito control measures to prevent mosquito breeding. The CHP will continue to work closely and maintain communication with the HA to make timely response. Once a suspected case is detected, the HA will activate the surveillance and notification mechanism and report the case to the CHP immediately.

The DH will continue to step up health education on mosquito-borne diseases, including disseminating travel health advice to travellers and enhancing public education on the prevention of CF through various online and offline channels. The interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee will convene a meeting tomorrow (July 23) to review the latest situation of mosquito proliferation and the anti-mosquito work of departments, and to plan for the anti- mosquito work for the future.

Information on CF

The symptoms of CF are similar to those of dengue fever. Patients with CF typically presented with fever and joint pain. Other common symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. While most patients recover on their own, in some cases, joint pain may persist for several months or even years. The mortality rate of CF is generally lower than that of dengue fever. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year. All of which were imported cases. There have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020.

According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide (including the Mainland, Taiwan and Singapore which are popular tourist destinations for Hong Kong citizens). Of these cases, about 80 were fatal.

According to the announcement of the Foshan Municipal Health Bureau, as of July 20, there were 2 285 CF confirmed cases in Foshan. The majority of cases (2 158 cases) were in Shunde District, primarily in Lecong, Beijiao and Chencun towns; 69 cases in Chancheng District, primarily in Shiwan Town, Zumiao and Zhangcha Street; and 58 cases in Nanhai District, primarily in Guicheng Street. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases so far. Regarding Macao, the first CF case this year was recorded on July 18. The patient travelled to Shunde during the incubation period and was classified as an imported case."

"Invest Hong Kong hosts seminar to help Mainland companies seize new ""go global"" opportunities through Hong Kong listings (with photos)",2025-07-22 19:44,2025-07-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200443.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (July 22) hosted a seminar in a hybrid format (both online and offline) to explore how Mainland food and beverage (F&B), retail and creative companies can seize new ""go global"" opportunities by leveraging Hong Kong's strengths as an international financial centre. By listing in Hong Kong, companies can tap into overseas markets and accelerate their global expansion. The event attracted over 110 corporate representatives to participate and received enthusiastic feedback. Participants learned about Hong Kong's unique advantages in supporting global business expansion and expressed strong interest in future opportunities.
  
  Prominent leaders from professional service organisations and corporates, including the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), Deloitte China, and China International Capital Corporation Limited, spoke at the seminar. They provided in-depth insights into Hong Kong's listing process and competitive advantages, discussed financial and tax planning strategies, and explored post-listing international business development opportunities. Representatives from Mainland enterprises already listed in Hong Kong also shared their success stories. They highlighted how they have successfully leveraged Hong Kong's unique advantages to go public and scale into global markets.
  
  In his welcome remarks, Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Arnold Lau said, ""As an international financial centre, Hong Kong is having the strong support of the country while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle. In the first half of 2025, IPO fundraising in Hong Kong exceeded $107 billion, ranking first globally. Notably, consumer goods, retail, and services accounted for 34 per cent of Main Board listings, reflecting strong market vitality. Over the past two and a half years, Invest Hong Kong has supported more than 1 300 companies in establishing a presence in Hong Kong, bringing in over $160 billion in investment, a clear reflection of international enterprises’ confidence in and recognition of Hong Kong’s business environment. This year marks the 25th anniversary of both Invest Hong Kong and the HKEX. We will continue to work closely together to support enterprises from listing to global expansion, contributing to the nation's dual circulation strategy.""
  
  Vice President, Global Issuer Services of the HKEX, Ms Maria Yuan, provided an introduction of Hong Kong's listing regulations, processes and policies, mapping the route for companies to list in Hong Kong.
  
  During the panel discussion, the Capital Market Services Group (HK) Leader, Southern Region of Deloitte China, Mr Robert Lui, said, ""Hong Kong's mature capital market, stable valuations, and ample liquidity, combined with its simple, low-tax regime, are favourable factors for businesses to build competitive financial and tax structures. For Mainland F&B companies, listing in Hong Kong not only helps boost brand visibility but also leverages the city's pivotal roles as both a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder', accelerating overseas expansion."""

CHP investigates two food poisoning clusters,2025-07-22 19:35,2025-07-22 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200763.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (July 22) investigating two epidemiologically linkedfood poisoning clusters affecting eight persons, and reminded the public and restaurant staff to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent foodborne diseases.

The two clusters involved seven males and one female aged between 23 and 25, who developed abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting, about four to 36 hours after having meals at Deluxe King Japanese Restaurant at 9/F, CTMA Centre, 1 Sai Yeung Choi Street, Mong Kok, on July 10 and 19 respectively.

  Of those affected, two persons sought medical advice. None of them required hospitalisation.

A preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the affected persons had consumed common food, including sashimi and raw oysters. Upon notification, staff of the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) had conducted joint investigation with staff of the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the CHP on the same day (July 21) at the restaurant, examined the handling process and food hygiene, and collected food and environmental samples for testing.

The CFS immediately instructed the premises concerned to suspend serving the incriminated food items with immediate effect and carry out cleaning and disinfection of the premises. The officers have also provided health education related to food safety and environmental hygiene to the staff of the premises.

The investigation of the CHP and CFS is ongoing.

To prevent foodborne diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times. When dining out, one should:


Avoid eating raw seafood;
Be a discerning consumer in choosing cold dishes, including sashimi, sushi and raw oysters at a buffet;
Choose pasteurised eggs, egg products or dried egg powder for dishes that often use lightly cooked or uncooked eggs;
Patronise only reliable and licensed restaurants;
Store and reheat precooked or leftover foods properly before consumption;
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked before eating during a hotpot or barbecue meal;
Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
Use two sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked foods;
Avoid patronising illegal food hawkers;
Drink boiled water;
Susceptible populations, including those with weakened immunity, the elderly, pregnant women and young children are at a higher risk of foodborne diseases, so they should not consume raw or undercooked foods;
Refrain from trying to use salt, vinegar, wine or wasabi to kill bacteria as they are not effective; and
Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet.

粵港澳三地聯防聯控　加強防控蚊傳疾病基孔肯雅熱,2025-07-22 19:00,2025-07-22 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200734.htm,"就廣東佛山及澳門近期先後錄得基孔肯雅熱個案，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十二日）表示，粵港澳三地一直按照行之有效的聯絡溝通機制，對涉及三地的傳染病進行聯防聯控工作。中心會繼續和廣東省、澳門的衞生當局保持緊密聯繫，按照風險評估採取適當的防控措施，預防基孔肯雅熱在本港傳播，保障市民健康。

粵港澳三地聯防聯控

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「粵港澳三地在傳染病防控、緊急應變及聯防聯控等方面一直合作無間。中心根據三地建立的傳染病通報機制，充分掌握廣東省近日基孔肯雅熱的最新情況。雖然本港今年暫時未錄得基孔肯雅熱的確診個案，但隨着夏季氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況預料會加劇，加上市民在暑假期間會較頻繁外遊，包括前往蚊傳疾病流行的地區，因此出現蚊傳疾病（如基孔肯雅熱、登革熱）輸入個案及本地傳播的風險增加。因此，市民不論在本地或外遊時，都應時刻做好防蚊控蚊及個人保護措施。」

為應對蚊傳疾病輸入風險的措施

徐樂堅醫生補充，為應對蚊傳疾病輸入的風險，中心港口衞生科已在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒旅客進行健康評估及在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。中心亦會與航空公司和旅遊業界等持份者保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議。

此外，中心已去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。

醫院管理局（醫管局）鑑於鄰近地區近期出現基孔肯雅熱爆發情況，已提醒醫護人員提高警覺，及早識別患者，以便適時診斷和治理病人，並已提醒醫院及診所加強控蚊措施，防止蚊蟲滋生。醫管局會繼續與中心緊密合作和保持溝通，作出適時應變。一旦發現疑似病例，醫管局會啓動監察及通報機制，即時向中心通報個案。

衞生署會繼續加強蚊傳疾病的健康教育工作，包括向旅客發布旅遊健康建議，並會透過線上及線下的不同渠道加強關於預防基孔肯雅熱的公眾教育。政府跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會將於明日（七月二十三日）召開會議，檢視蚊患最新情況及各部門的防治蚊患工作，並部署未來的防蚊工作。

基孔肯雅熱的資訊

基孔肯雅熱的病徵與登革熱相似，病人通常會出現發燒和關節痛。其他常見病徵包括肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、疲倦和紅疹。大部分病人可以自行痊癒，但個別病人的關節痛會持續數月甚至數年。基孔肯雅熱的死亡率一般較登革熱為低。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為外地傳入個案，由二○二○年至今，沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。

世界衞生組織的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案（包括內地、台灣、新加坡等香港人的旅遊熱點），當中約80宗為死亡個案。

根據佛山市衞生健康局公布，截至七月二十日，當地錄得2 285宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，絕大部分（2 158宗）出現在順德區，主要集中在樂從鎮、北滘鎮和陳村鎮；另外禪城區有69宗，主要集中在石灣鎮、祖廟和張槎街道；南海區亦有58宗，主要集中在桂城街道。所有患者症狀輕微，暫時沒有錄得嚴重或死亡個案。澳門方面，當局在七月十八日錄得當地今年首宗基孔肯雅熱個案，患者於潛伏期到過順德，被列為輸入個案。"

Hong Kong Customs detects money laundering case involving about $1.15 billion,2025-07-22 18:40,2025-07-22 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200721.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (July 22) detected a suspected money laundering case involving cash smuggling and virtual assets to launder a total of about $1.15 billion. One local man and one non-local man were arrested.

Acting upon intelligence, Customs officers earlier targeted a 37-year-old local man and a 50-year-old non-local man and initiated a financial investigation. It was revealed that the duo smuggled cash out of Hong Kong, and conducted stablecoin and fiat currency transactions with a doubtful fund source at a frequent and fast pace, which was highly incommensurate with their background and financial status. They were suspected of participating in money laundering activities.

Following in-depth investigations, Customs officers this morning raided four residential premises and two companies and seized a batch of items suspected to be connected with the case, including mobile phones, tablets and bank cards. The two men, who claimed to be self-employed and unemployed respectively, were arrested for ""dealing with property known or reasonably believed to represent proceeds of an indictable offence"" (commonly known as money laundering) under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO).

An investigation is ongoing. The two arrested persons have been released on bail pending further investigation. The likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

Under OSCO, a person commits an offence if he or she deals with any property knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that such property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and imprisonment for 14 years while the crime proceeds are also subject to confiscation.

Members of the public may report any suspected money laundering activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."
Government announces implementation of elderly-friendly building design and launches Elderly-friendly Building accreditation scheme,2025-07-22 18:34,2025-07-22 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200594.htm,"The Government announced today (July 22) that the Task Force on Promoting Elderly-friendly Building Design (Task Force) led by the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong, has formulated the proposals on elderly-friendly building design for implementation in phases starting from the middle of this year. Meanwhile, the Development Bureau (DEVB), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Green Building Council Limited (HKGBC) and the BEAM Society Limited (BSL), has launched a voluntary Elderly-friendly Building accreditation scheme to encourage the industry to adopt the recommended best practices for elderly-friendly building design.

With an ageing population in Hong Kong and to encourage ageing in place, ""The Chief Executive's 2023 Policy Address"" announced that the Deputy Financial Secretary would co-ordinate with relevant bureaux to put forward proposals to promote elderly-friendly building design. The Task Force announced in November last year a series of specific proposals for elderly-friendly building design and consulted the stakeholders. Stakeholders from the elderly, professional, developer and other sectors generally supported the proposals and provided valuable suggestions for refining the design proposals.

Having considered the views of the stakeholders, the Task Force has refined the proposals announced earlier after balancing various factors, including the needs of the elderly and other users, as well as the practical operational considerations in application by the market and the industry. The key requirements of the proposals to be implemented are as follows:

(1) promoting spatial accessibility to enhance the mobility of the elderly, e.g. provision of an automatic door at the main entrance of residential buildings, adopting wider common corridors and wider main doors of individual units, allowing the addition of lift towers to existing buildings, and using slip-resistant materials;
(2) encouraging the adoption of adaptive design in residential units to facilitate subsequent modifications, such as widening internal corridors and doors, using sliding doors for toilets, and installing grab rails/shower seats in bathrooms, etc;
(3) enhancing elderly well-being, e.g. providing fitness or other facilities for the elderly in recreational spaces, and providing shelters for resting facilities at communal outdoor spaces, etc; and
(4) facilitating the adoption of gerontechnology and Internet of Things, e.g. providing high-speed Internet access in home and public spaces, supporting the installation of smart card systems, motion sensors, etc.

âPlease refer to the summary table at the Annex for the detailed proposals.

Apart from new private residential buildings, composite buildings and commercial premises often patronised by the elderly (e.g. shopping complexes and clinics, etc), the above proposals are also applicable to alterations and additions to existing buildings of these building types. As for public housing developments and government buildings, the Government will also endeavor to adhere to the proposals. The proposals comprise both encouraged features and mandatory requirements, and the proposals will be implemented in two phases. For the encouraged features (including promoted features through incentives and the recommended best practices), the Buildings Department (BD) has administratively updated the practice notes and the ""Design Manual: Barrier Free Access"" for implementation. As for the mandatory design requirements, the Government will implement them through amendments to the Building (Planning) Regulations in the first half of 2026.

In addition, to encourage and facilitate the industry to adopt the recommended best practices for elderly-friendly building design, the DEVB, in collaboration with the HKGBC and the BSL, has launched the Elderly-friendly Building accreditation scheme. The scheme is voluntary and applicable to both new and existing buildings. Buildings that have adopted the specified recommended best practices, as assessed by the BSL, are eligible for the Elderly-friendly Building certification issued by the HKGBC. To promote participation in the accreditation scheme, the Elderly-friendly Building certification can be one of the ""specific standards"" for granting gross floor area (GFA) concessions by the BD (Note). In addition, the accreditation scheme also dovetails with the work of the Working Group on Promoting Silver Economy led by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration to promote the development of the silver economy.

The accreditation scheme is open for application from today. Please visit the website (www.beamsociety.org.hk/en/BEAM-Plus/BEAM-Plus-Theme-Certification) for details and to apply (beamplusadmin.my.salesforce-sites.com/), or call 3610 5700 to enquire about the details of the scheme from the BSL.

A Government spokesman said, ""After more than a year's effort, the Task Force on Promoting Elderly-friendly Building Design has formulated the final proposals and accomplished its mission. The Government is grateful to stakeholders for their support in promoting elderly-friendly building design and looks forward to facilitating and encouraging the industry to actively incorporate elderly-friendly building design elements into their buildings according to their own circumstances through various means to support ageing in place and make Hong Kong a livable city recognised by the silver hair market.""

Note: Starting from June 30, 2024, building projects are normally required to attain the ""Anticipated Gold"" rating in the BEAM Plus in order to be eligible for GFA concessions for green/amenity features. If a project can only achieve the ""Anticipated Silver"" or ""Anticipated Bronze"" rating, it has to demonstrate compliance with one or more of the specific standards stipulated by the BD in order to be eligible for GFA concessions. Currently, the specific standards include (a) enhanced greening provision; (b) health and well-being; (c) enhanced natural ventilation; (d) adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in plan submissions; and (e) adoption of multi-trade integrated mechanical, electrical and plumbing in building services (MiMEP)."
SCS encourages Administrative Service summer interns (with photos),2025-07-22 18:26,2025-07-22 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200523.htm,"  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, met and shared experiences with over 50 tertiary students participating in the Administrative Service Summer Internship Programme today (July 22). She encouraged them to apply for civil service positions such as the Administrative Officer (AO) post, and to use their professional knowledge to serve the community, benefit people's livelihood and contribute to the development of Hong Kong.

  This year, the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) has arranged for the interns to discuss and submit policy proposals in various areas including transport, planning and development, social enterprises, district affairs, the silver economy, etc, based on their observations and insights gained after working in different bureaux or departments. The CSB will submit these proposals to the bureaux or departments where the interns were assigned to for their reference.

  At the gathering, Mrs Yeung listened to the sharing by interns on both their work experiences and proposed policy initiatives during their internships. Drawing on her nearly 40 years of service in the civil service, she shared valuable insights as an AO and encouraged students to actively enrich themselves, plan ahead for their future and contribute to the development of the country and Hong Kong.

  She said, ""I am aware that this round of the Programme has received a record number of applications, attracting more than 300 applications from tertiarystudents in Hong Kong, mainland China and overseas. From your sharing, I can genuinely feel your passion for public service. I would like to take this opportunity to call on young people who are dedicated to serve the community and willing to take on responsibilities to join the civil service.

  ""I look forward to interns becoming AOs in the near future, serving the public and contributing to the country and Hong Kong with your own strengths and talents.""

  The Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Clement Leung, and Deputy Secretary for the Civil Service Ms Eureka Cheung also joined the sharing session and spoke with interns to learn about their internship experiences and views on Hong Kong's development.

  AOs are professional public administrators who play a pivotal role in the Government. They are responsible for assisting in the formulation of government policies, co-ordinating and supervising various initiatives, managing the use of public resources, promoting district work and publicising Hong Kong externally, etc. To enable AOs to accumulate experience and unleash their full potential in different public policy areas, they are posted to various bureaux and departments at regular intervals, broadening their horizons and gaining a fuller grasp of the challenges and opportunities in public administration.

  The CSB organises the Administrative Service Internship Programme every summer and winter, offering students who aspire to become AOs opportunities to work alongside serving AOs for around eight weeks to gain early practical experiences in public service and lay a solid foundation for their future career development. Statistics from the past five years show that around one in every five newly recruited AOs had participated in the Programme.

  The Government will launch a new round of recruitment for the posts of Administrative Officer, Executive Officer II, Assistant Labour Officer II, Assistant Trade Officer II and Management Services Officer II in September this year. Prospective applicants must first take the Common Recruitment Examination (CRE) and the Basic Law and National Security Law Test to attain the requisite scores. The new round of the CRE is currently open for application. Interested candidates are required to apply online by August 1. For details, please refer to the CSB website (www.csb.gov.hk/english/index.html)."

The CSB will submit these proposals to the bureaux or departments where the interns were assigned to for their reference.

  At the gathering, Mrs Yeung listened to the sharing by interns on both their work experiences and proposed policy initiatives during their internships. Drawing on her nearly 40 years of service in the civil service, she shared valuable insights as an AO and encouraged students to actively enrich themselves, plan ahead for their future and contribute to the development of the country and Hong Kong.

  She said, ""I am aware that this round of the Programme has received a record number of applications, attracting more than 300 applications from tertiarystudents in Hong Kong, mainland China and overseas. From your sharing, I can genuinely feel your passion for public service. I would like to take this opportunity to call on young people who are dedicated to serve the community and willing to take on responsibilities to join the civil service.

  ""I look forward to interns becoming AOs in the near future, serving the public and contributing to the country and Hong Kong with your own strengths and talents.""

  The Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Clement Leung, and Deputy Secretary for the Civil Service Ms Eureka Cheung also joined the sharing session and spoke with interns to learn about their internship experiences and views on Hong Kong's development.

  AOs are professional public administrators who play a pivotal role in the Government. They are responsible for assisting in the formulation of government policies, co-ordinating and supervising various initiatives, managing the use of public resources, promoting district work and publicising Hong Kong externally, etc. To enable AOs to accumulate experience and unleash their full potential in different public policy areas, they are posted to various bureaux and departments at regular intervals, broadening their horizons and gaining a fuller grasp of the challenges and opportunities in public administration.

  The CSB organises the Administrative Service Internship Programme every summer and winter, offering students who aspire to become AOs opportunities to work alongside serving AOs for around eight weeks to gain early practical experiences in public service and lay a solid foundation for their future career development. Statistics from the past five years show that around one in every five newly recruited AOs had participated in the Programme.

  The Government will launch a new round of recruitment for the posts of Administrative Officer, Executive Officer II, Assistant Labour Officer II, Assistant Trade Officer II and Management Services Officer II in September this year. Prospective applicants must first take the Common Recruitment Examination (CRE) and the Basic Law and National Security Law Test to attain the requisite scores. The new round of the CRE is currently open for application. Interested candidates are required to apply online by August 1.

公務員事務局今年安排實習生在不同決策局或部門工作後，按他們所見所聞所想，在多個範疇包括交通、規劃發展、社企、地區事務、銀髮經濟等，分組討論和提交政策倡議，公務員事務局會把這些建議交到派駐實習的決策局或部門供他們參考。

楊何蓓茵於聚會中聆聽實習生分享他們實習期間的工作點滴和政策倡議，並以自己近40年公務員生涯的經歷，分享作為政務主任的寶貴心得，勉勵學生積極充實自己、規劃未來，為國家及香港的發展作貢獻。

她說：「我知道今輪實習計劃接獲的報名人數創新高，吸引了本地、內地以至海外超過300名大專生報名申請。從大家的分享中，我感受到大家對公共服務的熱誠。我希望藉此呼籲有志服務社會、敢於承擔的年輕人積極考慮加入公務員行列。」

「我期待參與實習的同學們在不久將來成為政務主任，以自身所長，服務市民，貢獻國家和香港。」

公務員事務局常任秘書長梁卓文及副秘書長張誼亦特別到場與實習生傾談，聆聽他們分享實習生活和對香港發展的意見。

政務主任是專業的公共行政管理人員，在政府中擔任重要角色，負責協助制定公共政策、統籌和督導各項施政措施、管理公共資源的運用，並推動地區工作及對外宣傳香港等。為讓政務主任在不同公共政策領域中累積經驗、發揮潛能，政務主任會定期調派至各決策局和政府部門工作，擴闊視野，更全面掌握公共行政的各項挑戰與機遇。

公務員事務局每年夏季及冬季均會舉辦政務職系實習計劃，讓有志成為政務主任的學生，有機會與現職政務主任共事約八星期，提早汲取在政府工作的實際經驗，為未來事業發展奠定基礎。過去五年的統計顯示，每五名新入職的政務主任中，其中一人便曾參加政務職系實習計劃。

政府將於今年九月展開新一輪招聘政務主任、二級行政主任、二級助理勞工事務主任、二級助理貿易主任及二級管理參議主任的工作。有意應徵該等職位的人士，須先應考綜合招聘考試及「基本法及香港國安法測試」，以取得所需成績。其中，新一輪綜合招聘考試現正接受申請，有意投考者須於八月一日或之前於網上報名。詳情請參閱公務員事務局網頁（www.csb.gov.hk/tc_chi/index.html）。"

政府公布落實長者友善樓宇設計和推出「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃,2025-07-22 17:38,2025-07-22 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200588.htm,"​政府今日（七月二十二日）公布，由財政司副司長黃偉綸領導的「推動長者友善樓宇設計」工作組已完成制訂長者友善樓宇設計的方案，由今年中起分批落實。同時，發展局與香港綠色建築議會及建築環保評估協會合作，推出自願性「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃，鼓勵業界採用長者友善樓宇設計的建議作業範例。

隨着香港人口高齡化，為鼓勵居家安老，《行政長官2023年施政報告》宣布，由財政司副司長統籌相關政策局，制定有關推動長者友善樓宇設計的建議。工作組於去年十一月公布一系列長者友善樓宇設計的具體建議，並諮詢持份者。來自安老、發展專業和發展商等界別的持份者普遍支持建議，並就優化設計建議提出寶貴意見。

經考慮持份者的意見後，工作組在平衡各方面因素，包括長者和其他使用者的需要，以及市場和業界的實際應用考慮後，就早前公布的建議作出了微調，將落實的方案主要內容如下：

（一）促進空間通達性，提高長者的行動能力，例如在住宅樓宇正門提供自動門、採用較寬闊的公用走廊和住宅單位大門、容許於現有建築物加建升降機塔、使用防滑物料等；
​（二）鼓勵住宅單位採用靈活彈性的設計，方便將來改裝，例如加闊室內走廊和門、採用趟門洗手間、浴室內裝設扶手╱淋浴座椅等；
​（三）提升長者幸福感，例如在休憩空間為長者提供健身或其他設施、在戶外公用地方設置休憩設施的遮蓋等；以及
​（四）便利採用樂齡科技和物聯網，例如在家居和公共地方提供高速的互聯網服務，支援安裝智慧卡系統、活動感應器等。

方案詳情可參閱載於附件的一覽表。

上述方案除適用於新建的私人住宅樓宇、商住樓宇和長者經常出入的商業處所（例如商場及診所等）外，亦適用於這些類別的現存樓宇的改建及加建工程。至於公營房屋和政府建築物，政府也會致力按方案行事。方案包含鼓勵性設計元素和強制性規定，將分兩階段實施建議。就鼓勵性設計元素（包括透過誘因推廣的設計元素和建議作業範例）方面，屋宇署已以行政方式更新作業備考及《設計手冊：暢通無阻的通道》予以實施。至於強制性設計規定方面，政府會於二○二六年上半年透過修訂《建築物（規劃）規例》實施。

此外，為鼓勵和推動業界採用長者友善樓宇設計的建議作業範例，發展局與香港綠色建築議會和建築環保評估協會合作，推出「長者友善樓宇」認證計劃。計劃屬自願性質，適用於新建和現存樓宇，若申請樓宇能採用指定的建議作業範例，經由建築環保評估協會評估後，便可獲得由香港綠色建築議會頒發的「長者友善樓宇」認證。為推廣參與認證計劃，有關「長者友善樓宇」認證亦可作為屋宇署批予總樓面面積寬免的其中一項「特定標準」（註）。此外，認證計劃亦與政務司副司長領導的促進銀髮經濟工作組的工作相輔相成，以促進銀髮經濟發展。

認證計劃今日起接受申請，可瀏覽網頁（www.beamsociety.org.hk/zh-HK/beam-plus/beam-plus-theme-certification）了解詳情及申請（beamplusadmin.my.salesforce-sites.com/），亦可致電36105700向建築環保評估協會查詢計劃詳情。

政府發言人表示：「經過一年多的努力，『推動長者友善樓宇設計』工作組已制訂最終方案並完成任務。政府感謝持份者對推動長者友善樓宇設計的支持，並期望通過不同方式，促使及鼓勵業界按其實際情況，積極把長者友善樓宇設計元素融入構築物中，支援居家安老，讓香港成為銀髮一族公認的宜居城巿。」

註：由二○二四年六月三十日起，建築項目一般須在「綠建環評」中獲得預期金級的評級，方合資格就環保及適意設施獲批予總樓面面積寬免。如項目只能獲得預期銀級或銅級，則須證明符合屋宇署訂明的一項或以上「特定標準」，方合資格獲批予總樓面面積寬免。現時「特定標準」包括（a）加強綠化；（b）健康生活元素；（c）加強自然通風；（d）採用建築信息模擬技術（BIM）呈交圖則；以及（e）使用機電裝備合成法（MiMEP）。"

大家好！今天很高興來到香港科學館，參與「少年太空人體驗營2025」的出發儀式，同各位一齊見證30位中學生成為新一屆「少年太空人」，即將前往內地認識國家在航天科技的驕人成就。

自二○○九年起，康樂及文化事務署聯同香港中華總商會舉辦「少年太空人體驗營」，並得到總商會的全力贊助。多年來，這個活動讓接近400名學生到訪國家的航天基地，親身了解國家航天科技的高度發展，更有機會與航天專家和航天員見面學習。

如往年一樣，今年體驗營的選拔過程競爭激烈，有超過80間學校、約120位同學報名參加。今日在座的30位同學均是經過三輪嚴格選拔，才能夠脫穎而出成為「少年太空人」。我希望大家好好珍惜國家為你們提供的這個寶貴的、極難得的機會。這個體驗營不僅是你們對航天體驗的開始，更是開啓你們夢想旅程的第一步。

國家航天事業的飛躍發展，令人振奮。去年，中國科學院、國家航天局、中國載人航天工程辦公室聯合發布了《國家空間科學中長期發展規劃（2024—2050年）》，當中提出在二○三六至二○五○年，中國空間科學重要領域將達到世界領先水平。單在今年，國家在這個領域已有不同突破：今年四月恰逢第十個中國航天日及神舟二十號載人飛船成功發射；天問二號探測器自五月底升空，正前往一顆小行星進行探測與採樣任務；以及國家自主研發的大型民航客機C919，已在年初開通來往香港和上海的定期航班。這些都是國家航天科技人才努力不懈開創出來的成果。

近年香港的科研團隊在國家的支持下，積極參與國家的太空探索任務，例如：去年六月，香港特區首次有市民獲選為預備航天員，成為國家載人航天工程的載荷專家；以及香港理工大學的科研團隊為嫦娥四號、五號和六號的探月任務，進行研發和提供了技術支援，當中包括與中國空間技術研究院合作，研製了「表取採樣執行裝置」，協助嫦娥六號完成人類史上首次月球背面表土採樣任務。香港能為國家航天任務貢獻自身力量，實在是我們的榮幸；同時亦激勵我們要繼續做好航天創科教育，培育科研人才，把香港建設成為具影響力的國際創科中心。

在這裏，我想向大家劇透一下：八月一日，在我們身處的科學館將會舉行一個介紹國家航天、航空及航海領域科技成就的專題展覽。市民可以見證到國家憑着創新精神和攻堅壯志，在這些領域如何攀上世界領先地位。

最後，我衷心感謝香港中華總商會、中國載人航天工程辦公室、中聯辦及京港學術交流中心，對「少年太空人體驗營」的鼎力支持。我希望各位「少年太空人」把握這個彌足珍貴的受訓機會，親身感受國家航天事業的輝煌成就，以航天英雄為榜樣，將來成為推動國家航天事業發展的寶貴力量。多謝大家。"
Monetary Authority takes disciplinary action against 33 Financial Services Limited for contravention of Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance,2025-07-22 17:07,2025-07-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200331.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 22) that it had completed an investigation and disciplinary proceedings for 33 Financial Services Limited (33FS) under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (Chapter 584 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (PSSVFO). The Monetary Authority (MA) has reprimanded and ordered 33FS to pay a pecuniary penalty of HK$1,600,000 for contravening section 8Q of the PSSVFO as it failed to fulfil the minimum criterion under section 6(2)(b) of Part 2 of Schedule 3 to the PSSVFO.

The disciplinary action (Note 1) follows an investigation by the HKMA which found that, during the period from December 1, 2019 to August 31, 2023, 33FS failed to have in place adequate and appropriate systems of control to comply with the relevant paragraphs of the Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (For Stored Value Facility (SVF) Licensees) (Guideline) (Note 2).

Specifically, the contravention relates to deficiencies in 33FS' systems of control in three areas, namely:


obtaining sufficient information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationships with customers;
carrying out customer due diligence (CDD) measures on the business entities of which the individual customers acted on behalf; and
ensuring the identification and verification of identity of customers was properly performed and documented by its business partners, which were acting as outsourced entities for 33FS, in accordance with its internal requirement.


  In deciding the disciplinary action, the MA has taken into account the relevant circumstances and factors, including:


the seriousness of the investigation findings as well as the fact that 33FS has previous disciplinary record in respect of the PSSVFO;
the need to send a clear deterrent message to the industry about the importance of effective controls and procedures to address money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) risks;
33FS has taken remedial measures to address the deficiencies identified by the HKMA and enhance its systems of control; and
33FS is co-operative in resolving concerns identified by the HKMA.


  The Executive Director (Enforcement and AML) of the HKMA, Mr Raymond Chan,said, ""CDD measures are crucial for combatting ML and TF risks. Verifying the identity of customers and understanding the purpose and intended nature of the business relationships are essential elements of CDD measures. SVF licensees should ensure that they have effective CDD measures in place.""

Relevant link: Statement of Disciplinary Action

Note 1: The disciplinary action is taken under section 33Q of the PSSVFO.

Note 2: Paragraphs 4.6.1, 4.1.3(a), 4.1.3(d), 4.4.4, and 4.3.16 of the Guideline (October 2018 version and September 2020 version)."

Monetary Authority takes disciplinary actions against three banks for contraventions of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance,2025-07-22 17:05,2025-07-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200318.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 22) that it had completed investigations and disciplinary proceedings under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Chapter 615 of the Laws of Hong Kong) (AMLO) in relation to three banks: Indian Overseas Bank, Hong Kong Branch (IOBHK), Bank of Communications (Hong Kong) Limited (BCOM(HK)) and Bank of Communications Co., Ltd., Hong Kong Branch (BCOM Hong Kong Branch).

The Monetary Authority (MA) has: (i) reprimanded IOBHK; (ii) ordered IOBHK to conduct a look-back review of past transactions, and develop and implement a remedial plan to address the contraventions; and (iii) imposed a pecuniary penalty of HK$8,500,000 on IOBHK. Separately, the MA has imposed pecuniary penalties of HK$4,000,000 on BCOM(HK) and HK$3,700,000 on BCOM Hong Kong Branch. Details of the disciplinary actions against each of the three banks are set out in the respective Statements of Disciplinary Action attached.

The disciplinary actions (Note) follow investigations by the HKMA into the banks' systems and controls for compliance with the AMLO. The control deficiencies identified related to failures to establish and maintain effective procedures for continuously monitoring business relationships with customers.

There were significant deficiencies in IOBHK's transaction monitoring mechanism and management oversight of the bank's anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls.

The contraventions of BCOM(HK) and BCOM Hong Kong Branch arose from omissions to load certain types of transactions into the transaction monitoring system shared by the two banks, undermining the system's effectiveness in identifying potentially suspicious activities.

In deciding the disciplinary actions, the MA has taken into account the relevant circumstances and factors, including:


the seriousness of the investigation findings;
the need to send a clear deterrent message to the three banks and the industry about the importance of having effective controls and procedures to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks;
where applicable, the remedial measures taken by the banks to address the deficiencies identified; and
the three banks have no previous disciplinary record in relation to the AMLO and co-operated with the HKMA during the investigations and enforcement proceedings.


The Executive Director (Enforcement and AML) of the HKMA, Mr Raymond Chan,said, ""Effective transaction monitoring enables timely identification and reporting of suspicious transactions and thus is an essential component of banks' AML/CFT controls. Bank management should ensure that proper transaction monitoring systems and processes are in place and any identified deficiencies are addressed promptly.""

The MA is the relevant authority for authorized institutions under the AMLO."
​金融管理專員對三家銀行違反《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》採取紀律處分行動,2025-07-22 17:05,2025-07-22 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200317.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月二十二日）宣布，已根據《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（香港法例第615章）（《打擊洗錢條例》）完成對三家銀行的調查及紀律處分程序。三家銀行分別為Indian Overseas Bank, Hong Kong Branch（IOBHK）、交通銀行（香港）有限公司（交銀（香港））及交通銀行股份有限公司香港分行（交銀香港分行）。

金融管理專員：（i）譴責IOBHK；（ii）命令IOBHK就過往的交易進行回顧檢討，以及制定並落實補救措施，以糾正其違反事項；及（iii）對IOBHK處以8,500,000港元罰款。此外，金融管理專員對交銀（香港）處以4,000,000港元罰款和對交銀香港分行處以3,700,000港元罰款。金融管理專員對上述三家銀行所採取的紀律處分行動之詳情載於隨附各自的紀律處分行動聲明。

是次紀律處分行動（註）是金管局對上述銀行就《打擊洗錢條例》所設立的制度及管控措施的合規情況進行調查後而作出的。調查發現三家銀行未有設立及維持有效措施以持續監察與客戶的業務關係。

IOBHK的交易監察機制和管理層對打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施的監察存在重大缺失。

交銀（香港）及交銀香港分行的違反事項源於兩家銀行未有將某些類別的交易載入至兩家銀行共用的交易監察系統，削弱了該系統識別可疑活動的效用。

在決定上述紀律處分行動時，金融管理專員已考慮有關情況及因素，包括：


調查結果的嚴重性；
需要向上述三家銀行及業界傳遞明確的阻嚇訊息，以表明有效的管控措施及程序在應對洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集風險方面的重要性；
有關銀行已就發現的缺失採取補救措施（如適用）；及
上述三家銀行過往並無與《打擊洗錢條例》相關的紀律處分紀錄，並在金管局的調查及執法程序中表現合作。


金管局助理總裁（法規及打擊清洗黑錢）陳景宏表示：「有效的交易監察措施讓銀行能及時識別和舉報可疑交易，因此是銀行打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集管控措施中的重要一環。銀行管理層應確保銀行備有妥善的交易監察系統及流程，並在發現缺失時迅速糾正。」

Name: Ten Respiratory Pathogens Antigen Test Kit
Supplier: SAVEWO Distribution Limited
Manufacturer: Anhui Deepblue Medical Technology Co., Ltd
Model number: RP1011N-1
Lot numbers: 20250301 and 20250501

According to information provided by the supplier in Hong Kong, the product in question is an all-in-one test for 10 types of respiratory pathogens, including influenza, COVID-19 and H5N1 avian influenza. It has been distributed in the local retail market since March this year. Following internal testing, the manufacturer has updated the IFU to state that if the H5N1 detection zone is positive but the FIuA+B/COV detection zone is negative, the H5N1 avian influenza test result is invalid.

The supplier has uploaded the updated IFU to its official website. Members of the public who have purchased the affected batch of products are advised to contact the supplierat 5503 2370 if they have any queries regarding their RAT test results.

The product concerned is a Class C (moderate-high risk) In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device and is not listed under the DH's Medical Device Administrative Control System (MDACS).

The DH reminded members of the public that all RATs have limitations, including the possibility of false negative or false positive results. Therefore, RAT test results can only be used for reference purposes and cannot replace the professional diagnosis by doctors. Members of the public should consult healthcare professionals if they have doubts about the results of RATs.

Separately, the DH has introduced a voluntary MDACS, under which a listing system for medical devices and traders, as well as a post-market monitoring system, is in place to ensure that medical devices supplied in Hong Kong meet the safety, quality and performance requirements. Information on listed medical devices is uploaded to the website of the DH's Medical Device Division (www.mdd.gov.hk/en/mdacs/search-database/list-md/index.html). The DH advised members of the public to purchase medical devices listed under the MDACS wherever possible to ensure that the products meet the standards on safety, quality and performance.

The red flag has been hoisted, and beachgoers are advised not to enter the water to safeguard their health."

日本進口水產的檢測情況,2025-07-22 15:22,2025-07-22 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/22/P2025072200512.htm,"因應日本政府單方面決定把福島核電站核污水排放大海，食物環境衞生署署長已發出《食物安全命令》，禁止源自日本10（都）縣的水產、海鹽和海藻食品進口本港，受禁（都）縣包括東京、福島、茨城、宮城、千葉、群馬、栃木、新潟、長野和埼玉。

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由七月二十一日中午截至今日（七月二十二日）中午，食安中心已對38個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對50個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

由二○二三年八月二十四日起至今日中午，食安中心及漁護署分別檢測了共152 600個日本進口食物樣本（包括100 059個水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽樣本）及共34 694個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。"

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 21 to noon today (July 22), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 38 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 152 600 samples of food imported from Japan (including 100 059 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 34 694 samples of local catch respectively.

蕭德威先生（美心集團首席營運官（香港及澳門））、陳文宜女士（香港社會服務聯會（社聯）行政總裁）、蔡碧林女士（信和集團資產管理董事）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今日很高興出席「軟心膳x照護食種子餐廳暨社區推動計劃」啓動禮。我感謝美心集團積極製造軟餐，並聯同多間機構及團體進行推廣，致力照顧長者的需要，同時響應政府推動銀髮經濟的政策。

行政長官去年在《施政報告》提出成立促進銀髮經濟工作組，從五大範疇促進銀髮經濟的發展。今年五月，工作組公布了30項措施，其中多項與商經局推動銀髮友善飲食有關，包括聯同社聯支援商界推廣「照護食」、推動食品製造業界提供迎合長者需要及喜好的預先包裝食品等；同時透過「老友記‧食好啲」活動，帶動飲食業界提供適合長者的餐膳體驗和飲食優惠。

我很高興見到，在商經局的推動下，商界積極探索銀髮一族的需要和喜好，相繼參考社聯的《照護食標準指引》將現有菜式轉化成軟餐版本，或自主研發，推出「照護食」軟餐的選擇，並籌備一連串推廣活動，將軟餐的概念在社區廣泛宣傳。

我衷心感謝美心迅速響應政府推動銀髮經濟的政策。除了推出包括中式點心拼盤及西式套餐的軟餐品牌之外，更多走幾步，在社區與不同有心的機構進行宣傳，為長者提供安全且優質的用餐選擇。

例如美心早前聯同煤氣公司及香港聖公會福利協會，免費供應近萬份軟餐給護老院舍的長者享用，並安排言語治療師為他們評估吞嚥能力。另外，集團將會額外提供5 000份免費試食，惠及更多長者，並加入社聯的「照護食種子餐廳」計劃，以及在旗下多間酒樓和食肆提供堂食服務，進一步滿足長者的日常飲食需求。同時，美心將與信和集團及關愛隊合作，進行吞嚥評估和推廣「照護食」的工作，致力發展吞嚥友善的飲食文化。

各位，銀髮經濟市場龐大，消費群體不只本地的老友記，更包括內地、亞洲各地，甚至歐美的年長旅客。發展銀髮經濟不僅關乎本地長者的福祉，更有助吸引長者旅客來港消費和用餐，有利商界拓展顧客群。此外，我感謝社會各界積極響應工作組的呼籲，與商界協作，透過提供適老產品的技術支援、專業培訓和顧問服務，以及共享業務網絡等多項惠及銀髮一族的措施，把握銀髮經濟帶來的機遇，共同努力提升銀髮一族的生活質量及推動本港經濟發展。

最後，我預祝本計劃圓滿成功，亦希望更多食肆及餐飲機構把握銀髮商機，積極推出軟餐和大力宣傳，讓長者重拾出外享用美食的樂趣，為本港經濟注入活力及帶動經濟發展。多謝大家。"

我很高興見到，在商經局的推動下，商界積極探索銀髮一族的需要和喜好，相繼參考社聯的《照護食標準指引》將現有菜式轉化成軟餐版本，或自主研發，推出「照護食」軟餐的選擇，並籌備一連串推廣活動，將軟餐的概念在社區廣泛宣傳。

我衷心感謝美心迅速響應政府推動銀髮經濟的政策。除了推出包括中式點心拼盤及西式套餐的軟餐品牌之外，更多走幾步，在社區與不同有心的機構進行宣傳，為長者提供安全且優質的用餐選擇。

例如美心早前聯同煤氣公司及香港聖公會福利協會，免費供應近萬份軟餐給護老院舍的長者享用，並安排言語治療師為他們評估吞嚥能力。另外，集團將會額外提供5 000份免費試食，惠及更多長者，並加入社聯的「照護食種子餐廳」計劃，以及在旗下多間酒樓和食肆提供堂食服務，進一步滿足長者的日常飲食需求。同時，美心將與信和集團及關愛隊合作，進行吞嚥評估和推廣「照護食」的工作，致力發展吞嚥友善的飲食文化。

各位，銀髮經濟市場龐大，消費群體不只本地的老友記，更包括內地、亞洲各地，甚至歐美的年長旅客。發展銀髮經濟不僅關乎本地長者的福祉，更有助吸引長者旅客來港消費和用餐，有利商界拓展顧客群。此外，我感謝社會各界積極響應工作組的呼籲，與商界協作，透過提供適老產品的技術支援、專業培訓和顧問服務，以及共享業務網絡等多項惠及銀髮一族的措施，把握銀髮經濟帶來的機遇，共同努力提升銀髮一族的生活質量及推動本港經濟發展。

最後，我預祝本計劃圓滿成功，亦希望更多食肆及餐飲機構把握銀髮商機，積極推出軟餐和大力宣傳，讓長者重拾出外享用美食的樂趣，為本港經濟注入活力及帶動經濟發展。多謝大家。"
