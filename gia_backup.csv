天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-07-19 07:35,2025-07-19 07:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/19/P2025071900207.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月十九日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-19 07:35,2025-07-19 07:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/19/P2025071900205.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 19) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing; the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan; the Acting Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk; and representatives from relevant bureaux and departments attended the meeting.

  At the meeting, members were briefed by the Director of the Hong Kong Observatory on the latest assessment on Wipha. According to the present forecast, Wipha will enter within 800 kilometres of Hong Kong around midnight tonight. The Observatory will issue the Standby Signal No. 1 then, and consider issuing the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 during the day on Saturday (July 19). Wipha will be rather close to the vicinity of the Pearl River Estuary on Sunday (July 20). There will be heavy squally showers and thunderstorms. The Observatory will assess, on Saturday afternoon, the need of issuing higher tropical cyclone warning signals thereafter based on the latest weather information, including Wipha's distance to the Pearl River Estuary, its intensity and the change in local winds. The public is advised to pay close attention to the latest weather forecast and warnings from the Observatory.

  In response to the possible adverse weather conditions, Mr Chan co-ordinated the preparatory work of relevant departments at the meeting, which includes:


The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre (EMSC) under the Security Bureau has made advance preparation and stands ready for activation. It will be fully activated upon the issuance of Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8. Utilising the Common Operational Picture, the EMSC will conduct real-time citywide monitoring, and integrate updates from various departments to swiftly assess risks and formulate response plans and measures. Various emergency response teams, including the Fire Services Department, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Civil Aid Service and the Auxiliary Medical Service have completed all necessary preparatory work and are on standby, with sufficient manpower deployed to handle possible emergencies during heavy rainstorms and high wind, and to provide assistance to those in need.
The Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre of the Transport Department will continue to operate round-the-clock. It will also closely monitor traffic and transport conditions with public transport agencies, and disseminate emergency traffic information and public transport service arrangements to the public in a timely manner.
The Development Bureau (DEVB) is co-ordinating preparation work to deal with flooding, landslides and fallen trees and ensure safety of building structures. Emergency control centres of various departments are fully prepared to respond. The DEVB has also pooled the resources from contractors of works departments to ensure that sufficient manpower and resources are available for handling emergency situations.
The Drainage Services Department (DSD) completed the special inspection and carried out necessary clearance at about 240 locations which are prone to flooding due to blockages today. The ""just-in-time"" arrangement will continue, with at most 180 emergency response teams to conduct inspection and clearance of drainage channels in different districts across the territory. For coastal low-lying or windy residential areas with high risks, the DSD and the Civil Engineering and Development Department have established management measures in advance, including early warning systems and emergency response arrangements.
The Geotechnical Engineering Office and the Observatory closely monitor weather conditions and will issue a landslip warning when appropriate. Relevant departments have completed inspections of government man-made slopes with relatively higher potential impacts.
The Buildings Department has reminded property management companies to inspect building maintenance facilities, such as bamboo scaffolding, gondolas, signboards, solar panels and the like, to ensure their stability.
Relevant departments have completed tree risk assessments and mitigation work at locations with high risks.
The Highways Department (HyD) inspected again the flood warning systems installed at Kwun Tong Road Underpass and 16 pedestrian subways along Shing Mun River in Sha Tin, Lam Tsuen River in Tai Po and Tai Po River with a higher risk of flooding fromJuly 16 to 18 to ensure normal operation. In collaboration with the DSD, the department also carried out special inspections and clearance of public road sections which are prone to flooding due to blockages, including high speed road sections, such as San Tin Highway. The HyD also carried out special inspections and clearance of the drainage channels at roadside man-made slopes. In addition, the HyD has reminded relevant staff members and contractors to pay close attention to weather conditions and information released by the Observatory in order to make early preparations for the activation of the Emergency Control Centres.
District Offices have initiated relevant response measures, including co-ordinating with other departments and organisations to enhance preparedness, preparing sandbags and water-stop boards, etc. They will also mobilise District Council members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to make necessary preparations.


  The Education Bureau will closely monitor the weather conditions and announce the arrangement for schools as early as necessary to facilitate parents and students in making early preparations.

  The Labour Department reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees in times of typhoons and rainstorms as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). In drawing up and implementing the arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces, etc. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations and actual difficulties faced by individual employees, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach.

  The Government departments will continue to serve with dedication and make preparations on all fronts to safeguard the lives and property of the public as well as public safety. The Government urges the public to stay alert and stay away from dangerous places such as rivers and slopes in adverse weather conditions, refrain from water sports, and continue to pay attention to the latest news released by the Government."

​行政長官出席香港黃金交易所首屆董事會就職典禮暨金銀業貿易場115周年誌慶晚宴致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-07-18 19:36,2025-07-18 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800936.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（七月十八日）出席香港黃金交易所首屆董事會就職典禮暨金銀業貿易場115周年誌慶晚宴的致辭：

尊敬的祁斌副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、張德熙主席（香港黃金交易所主席）、李惟宏主席（香港黃金交易所就職典禮籌委會主席）、各位香港黃金交易所的董事、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今日非常高興出席香港黃金交易所首屆董事會就職典禮，並恭賀金銀業貿易場成立115周年。首先，我在這裏祝賀香港黃金交易所首屆董事會成員履新，並祝願交易所繼往開來，再創新猷，為香港黃金市場注入強勁動力，推動香港成為國際一流的黃金交易中心。在這裏祝大家115年生日快樂！

金銀業貿易場在一九一○年成立，陪伴香港走過115載的鎏金歲月，經歷了不同挑戰和機遇的千錘百煉，是香港唯一提供實貨黃金及白銀買賣的交易所，為會員搭建穩健可靠的交易平台，交易量近年持續上升。貿易場積極回應市場需求，今年成功向現代化治理邁出關鍵一步，完成了公司化、專業化轉型。新成立的香港黃金交易所將優化企業管治，為未來繼續拓展業務定下堅實的基礎。

當前，世界百年未有之大變局正加速演進，全球地緣政治變幻莫測，不確定性日益加劇。黃金作為避險資產的需求顯著增加，成為全球資金配置的重要組成部分。去年，全球黃金需求約4 550噸，創下二○○○年以來同期新高。在全球經濟東升西降下，亞洲市場逐步崛起，現在已佔全球黃金每年的需求超過百分之60，周邊經濟體對黃金交易及分散儲存的需求亦明顯增長。

去年，在香港金銀業貿易場交易的九九金每日平均交易額超過9.4億港元，按年大增兩成八，而今年首季的日均交易額更已超過12億港元，不但反映貿易場在香港黃金市場的重要功能，更顯示黃金市場的活力。

香港在「一國兩制」下擁有內聯外通的優勢，是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，亦是全球最大離岸人民幣業務中心，資金流通自由進出，法治制度源遠流長。在世界環境風雲變幻之下，環球投資者都披沙揀金，渴求安全穩定的發展空間。香港匯聚中國機遇和環球機遇，發展空間無限，正正為世界提供安全和發展的確定性。

我在去年《施政報告》中提出，構建國際黃金交易中心和大宗商品交易圈，為鞏固提升香港國際金融中心地位提供新切入點。上個月，上海黃金交易所在香港啓用首個離岸黃金交割倉庫，並推出在香港交割的黃金合約，支持內地與香港黃金市場聯動發展。今年一月，香港獲納入為倫敦金屬交易所全球倉庫網絡，至今已有八個認可倉庫獲批准成立，已在今個星期開始陸續投入服務，推進香港國際金融、航運、貿易中心協同發展。

政府去年年底已成立專責工作小組，全面檢視黃金金融交易相關範疇。小組匯聚了金融界、黃金交易業及相關專業領域的翹楚，包括今日在座的好幾位 。工作小組將努力制訂全面發展方案，涵蓋增加倉儲容量、優化交易和監管機制、拓展交易所產品等。

政府會團結各界發揮香港優勢，把變化中的環境轉變為機遇，吸引更多金屬和大宗商品在香港儲存和交易，推動黃金業務和相關金融服務的發展，逐步搭建完整的生態圈。

常言道：「真金不怕洪爐火」，只要我們攜手並肩，統籌和發揮好香港安全和發展的機遇，不斷改革求進、創新創造，香港的國際黃金交易中心必然是一面金光璀璨的金漆招牌。

最後，我祝願香港黃金交易所業務蒸蒸日上，交投暢旺，亦祝願各位金銀滿屋。多謝大家。"

DH investigates suspected illegal possession of unregistered proprietary Chinese medicines (with photo),2025-07-18 19:28,2025-07-18 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800902.htm,"  âThe Department of Health (DH) is today (July 18) investigating a suspected case of an illegal possession of unregistered proprietary Chinese medicines (pCms), and is urging the public not to use three types of pCms under the name of Eye Saver (a herbal formula eye conditioner) (see photo).

  The premises concerned is Macrobiotics Enterprises Limited, located at Room 155, 1/F, Peninsula Centre, 67 Mody Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon. Acting upon intelligence, the DH conducted a field investigation and seized three suspected unregistered pCms. They all have the same name and packaging. However, one had Chinese words ""å¼·å"" marked on it, one had Chinese words ""è¶ç´"" marked on it and one had Chinese words ""ç¹ç´"" marked on it. According to the content of the package insert, the products claimed to remove ophthalmia, improve and prevent cataracts, etc.

  The DH's investigation is ongoing. So far, no related adverse reports have been received.

  According to section 119 of the Chinese Medicine Ordinance (Cap. 549), no person shall sell, import or possess any pCm unless it is registered. The maximum penalty is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. Upon completion of its investigations, the DH will seek advice from the Department of Justice on prosecution matters.

  Members of the public who have purchased any of the above suspected unregistered pCms should stop usage immediately. Those who have applied any of the three pCms and are feeling unwell should seek advice from healthcare professionals. People who have the product can submit it to the DH's Chinese Medicine Regulatory Office on 16/F, AIA Kowloon Tower, Landmark East, 100 How Ming Street, Kwun Tong, during office hours for disposal.

  The spokesman said that the use of unregistered pCms may pose threats to public health as their safety, quality and efficacy are not proven. The public should not buy or use products of doubtful composition or from unknown sources. All registered pCms should carry a Hong Kong registration number on the product label in the format of 'HKC-XXXXX'. The list of registered pCms is published on the website of the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong (www.cmchk.org.hk/pcm/eng/#main_dis.htm) for public reference."

公務員事務局局長探訪土木工程拓展署（附圖）,2025-07-18 18:43,2025-07-18 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800626.htm,"公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵今日（七月十八日）下午到訪土木工程拓展署，與該署不同職系的員工代表會面交流，了解部門透過應用科技優化運作效率和服務的最新進展，以及有關防治山泥傾瀉和斜坡安全的工作。

楊何蓓茵在公務員事務局常任秘書長梁卓文陪同下，首先與土木工程拓展署署長方學誠和其他首長級人員會面，聽取他們講解土木工程處、土力工程處和各區拓展處的重點工作項目。此外，他們亦與該署各職系的員工代表會面，就他們關注的事宜交換意見。

楊何蓓茵表示：「社會對於公務員的期望不斷提高，而極端天氣帶來的挑戰越來越大，我希望同事繼續精益求精，檢視工作流程以提升效率和效能，以智慧創新應對轉變，增加市民的獲得感、幸福感、安全感。」

在參觀土力工程處緊急控制中心期間，中心主管人員向楊何蓓茵介紹由該署研發及管理的「聯合運作平台」電子系統，可供不同政府部門實時分享資訊，協助監察山泥傾瀉、水浸和塌樹等緊急事故，加強應變協調。土力工程處提供全年24小時緊急服務，以便一旦發生山泥傾瀉而出現危險時，為救援隊伍及政府部門等提供岩土工程方面的意見，以決定須採取的應變行動和作出部署。

此外，楊何蓓茵得悉該署今年開始試行部門研發由人工智能推動的山泥傾瀉警告系統，目的是更精準發放山泥傾瀉警告。這項透過雲端及物聯網技術，運用香港的降雨數據、過往的山泥傾瀉紀錄及人造斜坡資料，透過大數據分析，更準確地識別導致山泥傾瀉的因素，加強對降雨與山泥傾瀉關係的認知。新系統可進一步提高估算暴雨期間山泥傾瀉報告數目的準確性，從而提升山泥傾瀉風險評估的能力，優化山泥傾瀉警告的發放，加強預警。

負責規劃及地形評估的人員亦向楊何蓓茵介紹去年推出的數碼航空照片解讀系統，將歷史紙本航空照片數碼化，並集中到一個即時存取的數字平台，除了供政府部門和相關機構從遠端搜尋、閱覽和分析高解析度三維資料，更可讓專業人員繪製和檢視三維地形圖，支援相關研究，並應用於斜坡安全管理和土地規劃，減省存取實體照片的流程，既有助縮短工程時間和節省建造成本，兼具環保效益。

此外，該署人員亦講解他們如何提速提效協助推動北部都會區的發展。北部都會區位於地質複雜的區域，相關的工程地質資料非常有限。為加快發展速度並減少不同工程項目所需進行的土地勘測工作，土力工程處啓動了新界西北部的區域性土地勘測研究，於策略性地區進行土地鑽探和岩石荷載測試。"
SCS visits Civil Engineering and Development Department (with photos),2025-07-18 18:43,2025-07-18 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800629.htm,"  The Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, visited the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) this afternoon (July 18) to exchange views with staff representatives from various grades in the department, and to learn about the department's latest progress in optimising operational efficiency and services through the application of technology, as well as its work in landslip prevention and mitigation and slope safety.

 Accompanied by the Permanent Secretary for the Civil Service, Mr Clement Leung, Mrs Yeung first met with the Director of Civil Engineering and Development, Mr Michael Fong, and the directorate staff to learn about the key initiatives of the Civil Engineering Office, the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) and the regional development offices. They also met with staff representatives from various grades in the department to exchange views on matters of concern to them.

 Mrs Yeung said, ""As the expectations of the community for the civil service are constantly rising and the challenges posed by extreme weather are becoming increasingly severe, I hope my colleagues will continue to strive for excellence, review workflows to enhance efficiency and effectiveness, and respond to changes with smart innovations. This will strengthen the public's sense of fulfilment, happiness and security.""

 During the visit to the GEO Emergency Control Centre, officers in charge of the centre introduced the Common Operation Picture developed and managed by the department to Mrs Yeung. This electronic system facilitates the sharing of real-time information among different government departments to assist in monitoring emergencies such as landslides, flooding and fallen trees, as well as to enhance contingency co-ordination. The GEO maintains a 24-hour, year-round emergency service to provide geotechnical advice to rescue teams and government departments on any emergency actions to be taken to deal with danger arising from landslides for their determination of co-ordinated responses and mapping plans.

  Moreover, Mrs Yeung learned that the CEDD started a trial run of its in-house developed, AI-empowered Landslip Warning System this year, with an aim to issue more accurate Landslip Warnings. Through the cloud technology and the Internet of Things, the system can use Hong Kong's rainfall data, past landslide records and man-made slopes data to identify with higher accuracy the relevant attributes resulting in landslides through big data analysis. This strengthens the understanding of the relationship between rainfall and landslides. The new system can further enhance the accuracy of the predicted number of reported landslides during heavy rainstorms, thereby improving the capabilities of landslide risk assessment, optimising the issuance of Landslip Warnings, and enhancing early warning.

 Officers responsible for planning and terrain evaluation also briefed Mrs Yeung on the Digital Aerial Photograph Interpretation System launched last year. The system digitalises historical paper aerial photographs and centralises aerial photo imageries on an instantly accessible digital platform. This not only allows government departments and related organisations to remotely search, view and analyse high-resolution 3D data, but also empowers professionals to map and visualise 3D terrains to support related research for slope safety management and land planning. The system also eliminates the process of physical photo storage and helps shorten construction time, reduce construction costs, and promote environmental efficiency.

 In addition, the department's staff introduced their approaches for enhancing the speed and efficiency to assist in promoting the development of the Northern Metropolis. The Northern Metropolis is located in a geologically complex area with very limited engineering geological data. In order to speed up development and minimise the ground investigation work required across different projects, the GEO initiated a regional ground investigation study in the Northwest New Territories, carrying out ground drilling and rock load tests in strategic areas."

參觀者亦可透過香港本地藝術家Messy Desk（李美欣）的插畫設計，在拍照區感受香港充滿活力和璀璨的海濱面貌。展覽場地同時播放香港宣傳短片和設有數碼展板，介紹香港多項資訊，以及內地企業在香港的體驗，向參觀者展示香港作為全球最適合旅遊、就學、居住、工作和投資的城市之一所具備的元素。

新聞處處長廖李可期在今日舉行的開幕禮上致辭時表示，今年適逢香港特別行政區舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」10周年，新聞處特別在內地三個「一帶一路」的節點城市舉行展覽：首站上月在上海完滿舉行，吸引超過18萬名民眾參觀，今天在青島舉辦的是第二站，稍後將會移師成都舉行。

她說：「去年三月，『個人遊』計劃適用城市擴展至青島市，讓青島市居民可更靈活和便捷地探索香港；除了可以加深兩地民眾的交流，為促進兩地文化交融、民心相通注入更大力量外，『個人遊』旅客亦是帶動香港旅遊相關業務的重要力量。」

廖李可期補充說，香港跟青島之間距離雖遠，但實際上是近在咫尺：青港兩地之間每日有多班直航班次往返兩地，穿梭兩地只需要短短的三個多小時，實在是有非常好的條件繼續深化兩地在旅遊方面的合作，促進資源共享，推動客源互送。

廖李可期亦介紹是次展覽的亮點，包括設置「體育動感之都」展區，作為香港與澳門及廣東省在今年十一月合辦第十五屆全國運動會的預熱宣傳，以及透過裸眼3D展示和互動遊戲等藝術科技，全方位展示香港的文旅魅力和最新面貌。

她期望藉着展覽能讓青島的朋友感受香港的多元魅力，並吸引更多青島朋友認識和到訪香港。

此外，兩位才華橫溢的香港青年音樂家──香港中樂團嗩吶首席馬瑋謙及鋼琴演奏家梁思朗──將於七月十九日及二十日在展覽場地獻上精彩的吹管樂演奏，讓參觀人士體驗香港文化。

展覽期間亦會舉行「酷遊香港─沉浸式之旅」快拍留影互動遊戲。兩名勝出者可獲得由國泰航空贊助的豐富獎品，頭獎為雙人來回青島至香港商務客艙機票，二獎為雙人來回青島至香港經濟客艙機票。

展覽於青島大型商場金獅廣場舉行，免費入場，展期至七月二十七日。

青島是巡迴展覽的第七站，此前已於二○二三年七月至二○二五年六月期間在內地、東南亞國家聯盟和中東共六個城市成功舉行。

是次展覽的支持機構包括商務及經濟發展局「一帶一路」辦公室、香港人才服務辦公室、國泰航空、香港貿易發展局、香港旅遊發展局及啟德體育園。

"""Immersive Hong Kong"" roving exhibition opens in Qingdao (with photos)",2025-07-18 18:15,2025-07-18 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800766.htm,"  The ""Immersive Hong Kong"" roving exhibition, organised by the Information Services Department (ISD) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government to showcase the diversity and latest developments of Hong Kong through interactive art technology, opened in Qingdao today (July 18).

  Co-organised by the Shandong Liaison Unit of the HKSAR Government, the exhibition, themed ""Hong Kong - Where the World Looks Ahead"", invites visitors from Qingdao and the entire Shandong Province to explore the unique opportunities and potential for tourism, education, business and investment in Hong Kong.

  The exhibition enables visitors to delve into different virtual scenes representing the city, with a creative twist. The five thematic zones, namely ""Financial Bridgehead"", ""I&T Brain Bank"", ""Blossoming Creativity"", ""Diversity and Greenery"" and ""Buzzing Sports Action"", feature multiple interactive art projections, light box installations and naked-eye 3D displays, representing the distinctive appeal of Hong Kong.

  Visitors may also enjoy Hong Kong's vibrant and colourful skyline, illustrated by Hong Kong artist Messy Desk (Jane Lee), at a photo corner in the venue. Promotional videos on Hong Kong and digital panels presenting information about the city, as well as insights from Mainland companies about their experiences in Hong Kong, are also on display, highlighting why the city is one of the most desirable places to visit, study, live, work and invest.

  Speaking at the opening ceremony today, the Director of Information Services, Mrs Apollonia Liu, said that this year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Summit organised by the HKSAR, and that three node cities along the Belt and Road on the Mainland were specially selected to hold the exhibition. The first stop was successfully held in Shanghai last month, attracting more than 180 000 visitors, while Qingdao is the second stop, to be followed by Chengdu.

  She said, ""The eligible cities of the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS) expanded to Qingdao in March last year, enabling residents of Qingdao to explore Hong Kong in a more flexible and convenient manner. In addition to deepening exchanges and fostering cultural integration and people-to-people bonds between the two cities, IVS tourists also represent an important force in driving the business of tourism-related industries in Hong Kong.""

  Mrs Liu added that, although Hong Kong and Qingdao are far apart geographically, the two cities are in fact within arm's reach. They are linked by multiple direct flights operating daily, with a flight time of just over three hours. This offers an excellent foundation for the two cities to further deepen tourism co-operation, promote resource sharing, and facilitate the two-way flow of visitors.

  Introducing the highlights of the exhibition, Mrs Liu said a ""Buzzing Sports Action"" thematic zone has been set up, serving as pre-event publicity for the 15th National Games to be cohosted by Hong Kong, Guangdong and Macao in November this year. The cultural and tourism appeal, as well as the latest developments of Hong Kong, is also shown in a comprehensive manner through naked-eye 3D displays and interactive games.

  Mrs Liu expressed hope that the exhibition would provide an opportunity for friends from Qingdao to experience Hong Kong's charm from different aspects, sparking their interest to learn more about Hong Kong and visit the city.

  To give Qingdao audiences a taste of Hong Kong's cultural offerings, a wind instrument performance by two young Hong Kong music talents - the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra Suona Principal Ma Wai-him and pianist Aaron Leung - will be staged at the exhibition venue on July 19 and 20.

  During the exhibition, an interactive game, ""Snap a cool shot @Immersive Hong Kong"", will offer attractive prizes sponsored by Cathay Pacific for two winners. The winner of the Grand Prize will receive a pair of round-trip business class air tickets from Qingdao to Hong Kong, while the runner-up will receive a pair of round-trip economy class air tickets on the same itinerary.

  The exhibition is being held at Lion Mall, a major shopping centre in Qingdao, until July 27. Admission is free.

  Qingdao is the seventh stop of the exhibition, following its successful staging in a total of six cities in Mainland China, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the Middle East between July 2023 and June 2025.

  Supporting organisations of the exhibition include the Belt and Road Office of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Hong Kong Talent Engage, Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the Hong Kong Tourism Board, and the Kai Tak Sports Park.

  More information on the exhibition is available on thededicated pageon the Brand Hong Kong website and theHong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai website."
Speech by FS at Rhythm of Innovation (English only) (with photos/video),2025-07-18 18:06,2025-07-18 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800865.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Rhythm of Innovation today (July 18):

Sunny (Chairman of the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP) Corporation, Dr Sunny Chai), Albert (Chief Executive Officer of the HKSTP Corporation, Mr Albert Wong), young talents from Hong Kong and beyond,

Good afternoon.

 It's a real pleasure to be at this gathering, joined by so many energetic and passionate young innovators.

 Just moments ago, I had the chance to speak with some of you, interns and graduates from various incubation programmes here at Science Park. I must say I am truly impressed by your passion, creativity and drive to make a difference in life.

 Innovation and technology - or I&T - is a space full of promise. For a long time, people in Hong Kong have favoured careers like doctors, lawyers, engineers and accountants. While these are respectable and rewarding professions, today, I&T has become one of the most exciting avenues for young people to succeed. It is a sector of the future where you can find a meaningful career with positive impact on the community and the world.

 Take DeepSeek for example. It is a remarkable venture launched by a group of young innovators. Their high-efficiency, low-cost model has captured global attention and admiration. And they are just one of many success stories. Across both the Mainland and Hong Kong, young people are driving change through groundbreaking products and creative solutions that are shaping industries and transforming lives.

 And if you're thinking about a career in I&T, let me say: Hong Kong is the place to be.

 This Government puts I&T as a policy priority. We focus on sectors where we have competitive strengths, namely artificial intelligence, biomedicine, fintech as well as new energy and new materials. To expedite their development, we are actively attracting world-class enterprises and top talent to Hong Kong, especially those working on cutting-edge technologies. And we are nurturing a vibrant ecosystem of start-ups, with patient capital support. By setting up the Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited, we seek to channel private sector funds to companies even at their nascent stage.

 As an international financial centre, we also provide comprehensive funding support for start-ups and companies at various stages of development, from angel investments, venture capital and private equity to IPO.

 Apart from finance, Hong Kong has a number of other unique advantages.

 For example, we are home to world-class universities and research institutions. We are the only city in the world with five universities ranked among the global top 100. Our research institutions are among the best in Asia and the world. Our two medical schools are among the world's top 25.

 Besides, we have a thriving start-up ecosystem. As of last year, Hong Kong had around 4 700 start-ups, a 40 per cent increase compared to 2020. And our innovation flagships like Science Park and Cyberport provide the space, infrastructure, mentorship, resources, networks and programmes that support their growth and dreams.

 There's more. The Northern Metropolis on the boundary with Shenzhen - an area about one-third the size of Hong Kong - is being developed into an I&T powerhouse.

 With special cross-boundary policies and facilitation, the Northern Metropolis in conjunction with sister cities in the Greater Bay Area, like Shenzhen and Guangzhou, is fast becoming a global hub for R&D, tech innovation and commercialisation, as well as advanced manufacturing.

 And just as important - we offer a safe, open, multicultural environment that welcomes talent from all over the world.

 To those of you who are coming from the Mainland or overseas, I wish you to know that Hong Kong welcomes you. If you are inspired by what you see here, come and join us. Since launching our talent admission schemes in December 2022, we've received nearly 500 000 applications - and over 220 000 talented individuals have arrived in Hong Kong, many with their young families. They chose Hong Kong for its opportunities, unparalleled connectivity, quality of life, excellent education system, and many more.

 Ladies and gentlemen, the greatest asset of Hong Kong has always been its people - and that includes you: our next generation of innovators, creators and leaders.

 I look forward to seeing many of you again in the future - not just as students or interns, but as key members of Hong Kong's I&T community.

 Once again, I thank the HKSTP for organising this amazing and meaningful gathering.

 Let me end by wishing you all good health, successful careers, and a bright future. Keep dreaming, keep creating, and keep moving forward.

 Thank you very much."

"DH reminds public that ""Tianjiu"" therapy shall be performed by qualified Chinese medicine practitioners",2025-07-18 17:42,2025-07-18 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800784.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (July 18) reminded the public that ""Tianjiu"" therapy, which is a kind of Chinese Medicine Acupuncture treatment, should only be performed by qualified Chinese medicine practitioners (CMPs) in order to avoid adverse effects, or even aggravation of illness or injury.

  ""Tianjiu"" therapy stimulates specific acupuncture points with medication to prevent illness by unblocking meridians and collaterals and regulating ""qi"" and blood. Clinically, it can be used to treat various illnesses, such as chronic bronchitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, menstrual irregularities and joint pain etc.

The ""Sanfu Tian"" period this year starts from July 20 (Sunday) and ends on August 18 (Monday). Some people undergo ""Tianjiu"" therapy during this period to achieve better therapeutic effects.

In Hong Kong, ""Tianjiu"" therapy must be performed by CMPs with professional qualifications. The DH appeals to the public to have their health conditions assessed by a qualified CMP before receiving ""Tianjiu"" therapy to determine their suitability for the treatment. Some groups of people may not be suitable for ""Tianjiu', including children aged under 2 years old, pregnant women and patients with heat patterns as identified by CMPs.

Before receiving ""Tianjiu"" therapy, members of the public should confirm the qualifications of the CMPs. They should not allow unregistered or unapproved healthcare personnels to perform ""Tianjiu"". Since the professional qualifications and standards of such personnels have not been ascertained, the safety and treatment effect of their services are questionable and may even aggravate the condition or cause injury to those receiving therapy. Members of the public may request relevant supporting documents from CMPs practising in Hong Kong if they have doubts about their qualifications. A list of registered and listed CMPs is available for public inspection on the website of the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong(www.cmchk.org.hk).

In addition, members of the public should clearly understand the treatment procedure, potential risks and precautions etc, before receiving ""Tianjiu"" therapy. If anyone feels unwell during the therapy, seek advice from healthcare professionals immediately."
蚊傳疾病登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的最新情況,2025-07-18 17:05,2025-07-18 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800756.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月十八日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字和基孔肯雅熱最新情況。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，由於在夏季期間氣溫及雨量上升，本港蚊患情況預料會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往蚊傳疾病流行的地區，因此出現蚊傳疾病輸入個案及本地傳播的風險增加。

登革熱

由七月十一日至昨日（七月十七日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾到菲律賓。

截至昨日，今年錄得30宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。二○二三年則錄得62宗外地傳入個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過一萬五千宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過2 800宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得140宗本地感染病例，於七月七日至十三日的一周內已錄得51宗，其中以廣州、中山、佛山和潮州錄得的病例最多。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

基孔肯雅熱

由二○二○年至今，本港沒有錄得確診基孔肯雅熱的個案。

世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱個案。截至今年六月初，全球14個國家／地區共錄得超過22萬宗個案（包括內地、台灣、新加坡等香港人的旅遊熱點），當中約80宗為死亡個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省於七月八日至十四日的一周內共錄得481宗本地感染病例，所有病例均於佛山錄得（順德區478宗；禪城區3宗）。

徐樂堅醫生說：「本港經常有外地傳入的登革熱個案，每年間中亦有零星的本地登革熱個案。由於香港存在白紋伊蚊，本地市民有機會受感染。基孔肯雅熱方面，雖然香港目前未有發現主要傳播基孔肯雅熱的埃及伊蚊，但白紋伊蚊亦可以傳播基孔肯雅熱。基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的輸入個案如在傳染期被蚊子叮咬，有機會導致本地傳播。炎熱多雨的春夏月份有利蚊子迅速繁殖，如控蚊成效不足，便有爆發蚊傳疾病的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防蚊傳疾病的最佳方法。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


​含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%＊；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；及
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用。

＊如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺。

​​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務登革熱專頁、衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁及YouTube頻道。"
"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2025-07-18 17:05,2025-07-18 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800749.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 18) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases and updated the latest situation of chikungunya fever (CF). The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminded the public that due to the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, mosquito infestation is expected to be aggravated in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public travel more frequently during summer holidays to regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. As a result, the risks of imported cases and local transmission of mosquito-borne diseases increase.

Dengue fever

  From July 11 to yesterday (July 17), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to the Philippines during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 30 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases. In 2023, 62 imported cases of DF were recorded.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 15 000 cases so far this year. Singapore also recorded over 2 800 cases. Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 140 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 51 cases were recorded in a week between July 7 and 13, with the highest number of cases recorded in Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Foshan and Chaozhou.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.


Chikungunya fever

There have been no CF cases in Hong Kong since 2020.

According to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. As of early June this year, over 220 000 cases had been reported in 14 countries/regions worldwide (including the Mainland, Taiwan and Singapore which are popular tourist destinations for Hong Kong citizens). Of these cases, about 80 were fatal. Furthermore, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 481 locally infected cases in a week between July 8 and 14, and all cases were reported from Foshan (478 in Shunde and three in Chancheng).

  ""There are frequent imported cases of dengue fever in Hong Kong, as well as occasional sporadic local cases every year. The presence of Aedes albopictus in Hong Kong makes our population vulnerable. Regarding CF, though Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for spreading CF, is not found in Hong Kong, Aedes albopictus can also transmit CF. Imported cases of CF and DF can lead to local transmission if they are bitten by mosquitoes during the communicable period. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot, rainy spring and summer months. There are risks of mosquito-borne diseases outbreaks if mosquito control is inadequate. Hence, mosquito control is of paramount importance. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. The public is reminded that eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are key to preventing mosquito-borne diseases. Those returning from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" Dr Tsui added.

  Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:

Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


DEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children*;
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent; and
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions.

* For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the chikungunya fever page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."

  After the meeting, Dr Cheung said that the Department of Justice (DoJ) is committed to promoting the diversified development of sports dispute resolution services in Hong Kong and is actively promoting co-operation in sports dispute resolution services between Hong Kong and the Mainland, as well as other regions overseas, with a view to building Hong Kong into a sports dispute resolution services centre in the Asia-Pacific region.

  Dr Cheung said that Hong Kong has always been recognised and trusted by the international community for its arbitration and mediation services, and maintains a rich pool of talent in sports dispute resolution services. Shenzhen has long been a close partner of Hong Kong in arbitration, and has been actively participating in the national development of sports arbitration in recent years. He expressed hope that Hong Kong and Shenzhen can strengthen co-operation in sports dispute resolution, giving full play to theGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area's advantages of ""one country, two systems and three jurisdictions"" and promoting the development of sports dispute resolution services in the two places with innovative thinking.

  Dr Cheung also mentioned that the DoJ is taking forward the pilot scheme on sports dispute resolution as announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"" at full steam on the local level. The invitation for the industry to submit proposals for operation of the pilot scheme began at the end of last month, with the aim of identifying a suitable administering body and a technology service provider to provide a fast, reliable and neutral resolution mechanism for sports disputes. The period for submission of proposals will end on July 31 and the pilot scheme is expected to be launched in the second half of the year."

海關人員七月十六日在深圳灣管制站檢查一個由加拿大經內地抵港並報稱為嬰兒奶瓶消毒器的快遞包裹。經檢驗後，海關人員在一個嬰兒奶瓶消毒器內發現該批懷疑冰毒。

海關人員遂於昨日（七月十七日）展開監控遞送行動，在旺角拘捕一名五十六歲懷疑涉案的女子及一名五十八歲懷疑涉案的男子。

案件仍在調查中。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。此外，市民亦要避免將個人資料或地址交予他人以作收取包裹或貨物用途。

A woman and a man were arrested.

Customs officers on July 16 inspected an express parcel, which was declared as baby bottle sanitiser, arriving in Hong Kong from Canada via the Mainland at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point. Upon examination, Customs officers found the batch of suspected methamphetamine concealed inside a baby bottle sanitiser.

Customs officers subsequently mounted a controlled delivery operation yesterday (July 17) and arrested a 56-year-old woman and a 58-year-old man in Mong Kok suspected to be connected with the case.

An investigation is ongoing.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people, nor to release their personal data or home address to others for receiving parcels or goods.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
Business expectations for the third quarter of 2025,2025-07-18 16:30,2025-07-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800460.htm,"The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (July 18) the results of the Quarterly Business Tendency Survey for the third quarter (Q3) of 2025.

Business Situation

For all surveyed sectors taken together, the proportion of respondents expecting their business situation to be better (10%) in Q3 2025 over the preceding quarter is lower than that expecting it to be worse (18%).

When compared with the results of the Q2 2025 survey round, the proportion of respondents expecting a better business situation in Q3 2025 is 10%, slightly higher than the corresponding proportion in Q2 2025 (9%). On the other hand, the proportion of respondents expecting a worse business situation in Q3 2025 is broadly the same as the corresponding proportion in Q2 2025 (18%).

Analysed by sector, respondents in quite a number of the surveyed sectors expect their business situation to decrease on balance in Q3 2025 as compared with Q2 2025. In particular, significantly more respondents in the transportation, storage and courier services sector expect their business situation to be worse in Q3 2025 as compared with Q2 2025.

The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. In this type of survey on expectations, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the future accords with the underlying trends. The enumeration period for this survey round was from June 3, 2025 to July 7, 2025.

Volume of Business / Output

Respondents in quite a number of the surveyed sectors expect their volume of business / output to decrease on balance in Q3 2025 as compared with Q2 2025. In particular, more respondents in the construction; transportation, storage and courier services; import/export trade and wholesale; accommodation and food services; and retail sectors expect their volume of construction output / business / sales to decrease in Q3 2025 over Q2 2025.

Employment

Respondents in quite a number of the surveyed sectors expect their employment to remain broadly unchanged in Q3 2025 as compared with Q2 2025. However, more respondents in the information and communications sector expect their employment to decrease in Q3 2025 over Q2 2025. In the real estate sector, on the other hand, more respondents expect their employment to increase, as compared to those expecting it to decrease.

Selling Price / Service Charge

Respondents in most of the surveyed sectors expect their selling prices / service charges to remain broadly unchanged in Q3 2025 as compared with Q2 2025. However, significantly more respondents in the construction sector expect their tender prices to go down in Q3 2025 over Q2 2025.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that the overall near-term business outlook among large enterprises for the third quarter of 2025 was slightly better than the expectation for the previous quarter, while the hiring appetite remained stable.

Looking forward, the spokesman said that the ongoing uncertainty in the external environment would continue to affect the local business sentiment. Nonetheless, the resilient local economy and sustained steady growth in the Mainland economy should provide support. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further Information

The survey gathers views on short-term business performance from the senior management of about 560 prominent establishments in various sectors in Hong Kong with a view to providing a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for predicting the short-term future economic performance of the local economy.

The survey covers 10 major sectors in Hong Kong, namely manufacturing; construction; import / export trade and wholesale; retail; accommodation and food services (mainly covering services rendered by hotels and restaurants); transportation, storage and courier services; information and communications; financing and insurance; real estate; and professional and business services sectors.

Views collected in the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in, and are limited to the expected direction of quarter-to-quarter change (e.g. ""up"", ""same"" or ""down"") but not the magnitude of change. In collecting views on the quarter-to-quarter changes, if the variable in question is subject to seasonal variations, respondents are asked to provide the expected changes after excluding the normal seasonal variations.

Survey results are generally presented as ""net balance"", i.e. the difference between the percentage of respondents choosing ""up"" and that choosing ""down"". The percentage distribution of respondents among various response categories (e.g. ""up"", ""same"" and ""down"") reflects how varied their business expectations are. The ""net balance"", with its appropriate sign, indicates the direction of expected change in the variable concerned. A positive sign indicates a likely upward trend while a negative sign indicates a likely downward trend. However, the magnitude of the ""net balance"" reflects only the prevalence of optimism or pessimism, but not the magnitude of expected change, since information relating to such magnitude is not collected in the survey.

Furthermore, owing to sample size constraint, care should be taken in interpreting survey results involving a small percentage (e.g. less than 10%) of respondents in individual sectors.

Chart 1 shows the views on expected changes in business situation for the period Q3 2024 to Q3 2025.

Table 1 shows the net balances of views on expectations in respect of different variables for Q3 2025.

The survey results are published in greater detail in the ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey, Q3 2025"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110008&scode=300).

二零二五年第三季業務展望,2025-07-18 16:30,2025-07-18 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800464.htm,"政府統計處今日（七月十八日）發表二零二五年第三季業務展望按季統計調查的結果。

業務狀況

綜合是項統計調查所涵蓋的行業而言，預期二零二五年第三季的業務狀況較上一季為佳的受訪者（10%）比預期較差者（18%）所佔的比例為低。

與二零二五年第二季統計調查的結果比較，預期二零二五年第三季的業務狀況較上一季為佳的受訪者的比例為10%，較二零二五年第二季的相應比例（9%）略高。同時，預期業務狀況較上一季為差的受訪者的比例與二零二五年第二季的相應比例（18%）大致相同。

按行業分析，在不少涵蓋行業中，受訪者總體而言預期二零二五年第三季的業務狀況較二零二五年第二季為差。尤其在運輸、倉庫及速遞服務業中，有顯著較多的受訪者預期二零二五年第三季其業務狀況較二零二五年第二季為差。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。就這類有關展望的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對將來的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這一輪統計調查的訪問期由二零二五年六月三日至二零二五年七月七日。

業務／產出量

在不少涵蓋行業中，受訪者總體而言預期二零二五年第三季的業務／產出量較二零二五年第二季下降。尤其在建造業，運輸、倉庫及速遞服務業，進出口貿易及批發業，住宿及膳食服務業，以及零售業中，有較多的受訪者預期二零二五年第三季其建造工程完成量／業務量／銷售量較二零二五年第二季下降。

就業

在不少涵蓋行業中，受訪者總體而言預期二零二五年第三季的就業人數較二零二五年第二季大致維持不變。然而，在資訊及通訊業中，有較多的受訪者預期二零二五年第三季其就業人數較二零二五年第二季下降。另一方面，在地產業中，預期其就業人數上升的受訪者則比預期下降者為多。

貨品售價／服務收費

在大部分涵蓋行業中，受訪者總體而言預期二零二五年第三季的貨品售價／服務收費較二零二五年第二季大致維持不變。然而，在建造業中，有顯著較多的受訪者預期二零二五年第三季其投標價格較二零二五年第二季下降。

政府發言人表示，大型企業就二零二五年第三季的整體短期業務前景與上一季的展望相比有輕微改善，而招聘意欲保持平穩。

展望未來，發言人指出外圍環境持續不確定將繼續影響本地營商氣氛。然而，本地經濟表現強韌，內地經濟繼續穩步增長，應可提供支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

這項統計調查搜集香港各行業中約560間大規模的機構單位的高級管理人員對短期業務表現的意見，以在最短時間內，就預測本地不久將來的經濟表現提供快捷的參考。

這項統計調查涵蓋香港十個主要行業，分別是製造業，建造業，進出口貿易及批發業，零售業，住宿及膳食服務業（主要包括酒店及餐館提供的服務），運輸、倉庫及速遞服務業，資訊及通訊業，金融及保險業，地產業，以及專業及商用服務業。

統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見；以及只限於預期季度間變動的方向（如「上升」、「不變」或「下降」），而並非變動的幅度。搜集季度間變動的意見時，如有關項目受季節性影響，受訪者會提供撇除正常季節性變動後的預期變動。

統計調查結果一般以「淨差額」表示，即填報「上升」的機構單位百分比減去填報「下降」的機構單位百分比。填報不同回應組別（如「上升」、「不變」及「下降」）的機構單位的百分比分布反映他們對業務展望的差異程度。「淨差額」的正負符號反映該項目的預期變動的方向。正數反映有關項目有可能上升的趨勢，而負數則反映有可能下降的趨勢。不過，正或負數值只反映受訪者樂觀或悲觀的普遍程度，而非預期變動的幅度，因這項統計調查並沒有搜集有關該幅度的資料。

此外，由於樣本規模有所局限，在個別行業中，涉及小數值的機構單位百分比（如小於10%）的統計調查結果，須謹慎闡釋。

圖1顯示於二零二四年第三季至二零二五年第三季期間有關業務狀況預期變動的意見。

二○二五年六月底綜合利率,2025-07-18 16:30,2025-07-18 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800693.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（七月十八日）公布二○二五年六月底的綜合利率（註一）。

反映銀行平均資金成本的綜合利率在二○二五年六月底為1.26厘，較二○二五年五月底的1.61厘下跌35基點（見附件圖1）。綜合利率下跌，主要反映月內存款的加權資金成本減少（見附件圖2）（註二）。

金管局每月均公布綜合利率。由二○二五年七月底的統計起，有關的每月數字將只會在金管局網站《金融數據月報》（www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/market-data-and-statistics/monthly-statistical-bulletin/T0605.xls）發布。

註一：綜合利率是指銀行帳冊上所有港元利率敏感負債的加權平均利率，這些負債包括客戶存款、銀行同業存款、可轉讓存款證及其他債務工具，以及並無牽涉正式支付利息但其價值對利率變動敏感的所有其他負債（如港元不計息活期存款）。綜合利率是根據約佔銀行體系總客戶存款九成的零售銀行所提供的資料編製。應注意綜合利率只反映平均利息支出，並未涵蓋借出貸款涉及的其他成本，如營運成本（如員工及租務支出）、信貸成本及對沖成本。

註二：二○一九年六月起，綜合利率及加權存款利率已按照新實施的本地「銀行帳內的利率風險」架構計算。因此有關數字不能直接與以往月份的數字相比。"
Composite Interest Rate: End of June 2025,2025-07-18 16:30,2025-07-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800697.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (July 18) the composite interest rate at the end of June 2025 (Note 1).

The composite interest rate, which is a measure of the average cost of funds of banks, decreased by 35 basis points to 1.26 per cent at the end of June 2025, from 1.61 per cent at the end of May 2025 (see Chart 1 in the Annex). The decrease in composite interest rate reflected the decreases in the weighted funding cost for deposits during the month (see Chart 2 in the Annex) (Note 2).

The HKMA publishes the composite interest rate on a monthly basis. Beginning with the end-July 2025 statistics, the monthly publication will only be released in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin on the HKMA website (www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/market-data-and-statistics/monthly-statistical-bulletin/T0605.xls).

Note 1: The composite interest rate is a weighted average interest rate of all Hong Kong dollar interest-rate-sensitive liabilities, which include deposits from customers, amounts due to banks, negotiable certificates of deposit and other debt instruments, and all other liabilities that do not involve any formal payment of interest but the values of which are sensitive to interest rate movements (such as Hong Kong dollar non-interest bearing demand deposits) on the books of banks. Data from retail banks, which account for about 90 per cent of the total customers' deposits in the banking sector, are used in the calculation. It should be noted that the composite interest rate represents only average interest expenses. There are various other costs involved in the making of a loan, such as operating costs (e.g. staff and rental expenses), credit cost and hedging cost, which are not covered by the composite interest rate.

Note 2: Since June 2019, the composite interest rate and weighted deposit rate have been calculated based on the new local ""Interest rate risk in the banking book"" (IRRBB) framework. As such, these figures are not strictly comparable with those of previous months."
Amendment Regulations on streamlining of permit applications for cross-boundary vehicles gazetted,2025-07-18 16:20,2025-07-18 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800719.htm,"The Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulation 2025, the Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulation 2025, the Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 5) Regulation 2025 and the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 (collectively the Amendment Regulations) were gazetted today (July 18). The Amendment Regulations seek to provide greater convenience for cross-boundary vehicles by streamlining the arrangements of Closed Road Permits (CRP) and International Circulation Permits (ICP).

A spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""With the increasingly frequent traffic flow among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, the Government has been proactively enhancing the relevant licensing services of the Transport Department in order to assist drivers and more effectively respond to the growing demand for cross-boundary travel. The Amendment Regulations will streamline the application procedures and requirements, and are expected to reduce and simplify the procedures for applicants/permit holders of the regular quota schemes, Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles and the recently announced Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles schemes, bringing them greater convenience.""

The major proposed amendments in the Amendment Regulations include:

(1) CRP: extending the maximum validity period of CRP from 12 months to 60 months for cross-boundary vehicles, and adjusting the fee levels for CRP to cost-recovery levels; and exempting vehicles participating in designated cross-boundary driving schemes that meet the specified requirements from applying for a CRP based on risk control consideration. As the CRP will either be exempted or with its validity extended, the CRP fees payable by users will generally be reduced; and

(2) ICP: introducing electronic ICPs (e-ICP) with a streamlined application and collection process, allowing applicants to submit applications and supporting documents online, and to collect e-ICP with self-printing.

The Government consulted the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport on the above streamlining arrangements for CRP and ICP respectively, and received general support from the Members. The Amendment Regulations will be tabled at the LegCo on July 23 for negative vetting. Subject to scrutiny by the LegCo, the exemption arrangement for CRP and the streamlining measures for ICP under the Amendment Regulations will be effective on October 1 this year; and the arrangements for extension of CRP validity period and fees adjustment will be effective on January 1, 2026. The Transport Department will continue to enhance different cross-boundary transport measures, providing a better travel experience for Hong Kong citizens and cross-boundary travellers."
GBA Office holds first seminar in Xian to promote GBA development opportunities (with photos),2025-07-18 16:18,2025-07-18 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800519.htm,"  The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development Office (GBA Office) today (July 18) held the GBA Via Hong Kong luncheon seminar in Xian to promote the vast opportunities brought about by the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the growth potential of Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis to enterprises in Shaanxi. Over 260 participants attended the event.

 The Commissioner for the Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Ms Maisie Chan, delivered a video speech at the seminar. She said that to fully leverage Hong Kong's advantage of connecting with both the Mainland and the world, the GBA Office not only expends efforts on overseas publicity and promotion, but also strengthens domestic ties by actively promoting development opportunities in the GBA to different Mainland cities. Commencing the visit in Xian - a national central city in the heart of China - signified a pivotal step in the GBA's ""northbound empowerment"" and its connection with the Silk Road Economic Belt. With the support from the Central Authorities and the concerted efforts of various GBA cities, the GBA has continued to flourish in terms of economic strength and competitiveness, advancing towards the goal of becoming a world-class bay area. As a core city and regional development engine of the GBA, and with the unique advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, Hong Kong is an ideal partner for Shaanxi enterprises to expand into the GBA and explore the global market. She encouraged enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong and leverage the city as an internationalised platform to go global.

 The Deputy Commissioner for the Development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Ms Aubrey Fung, delivered a keynote speech titled ""GBA’s development opportunities and Hong Kong’s advantages in empowering Shaanxi enterprises to go global"". She said that the GBA is of immense strategic significance in national development, presenting boundless business opportunities for Shaanxi and global enterprises. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong possesses an excellent business environment that is highly market-oriented and internationalised, underpinned by the rule of law, with distinctive strengths in financial services, innovation and technology, and trade and logistics, etc. With the further deepening of co-operation between Shaanxi and Hong Kong, the city's unique strengths and Shaanxi's solid industrial foundation and vibrant technological innovation would create synergy, thereby fostering a win-win outcome and resource complementarity between the two places, and injecting new impetus into the country's high-quality development.

 The Deputy Director of the Northern Metropolis Co-ordination Office, Ms Pecvin Yong, said at the seminar that the Northern Metropolis, aligning with the national development strategy and abutting Shenzhen with a global outlook, can contribute to the GBA becoming a world-class top-notch bay area. The Northern Metropolis also offers development and investment opportunities for Shaanxi's enterprises. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to adopt an industry-oriented approach in planning and implementing the Northern Metropolis as well as diversified land disposal approaches, including large-scale land disposal, with a view to attracting talent and resources to Hong Kong, helping the Northern Metropolis to become a new engine for Hong Kong's economic growth.

 Today's seminar was co-organised by the GBA Office, the Shaanxi Liaison Unit of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government. The seminar also featured a question-and-answer session to facilitate exchanges, enabling participants to gain a deeper understanding of the development potential of the GBA and the Northern Metropolis, and providing a high-value exchange platform for enterprises of the two regions."

透過法例修訂，高度或闊度不超過45毫米的迷你杯裝蒟蒻果凍將禁止繼續在市場上出售；其他蒟蒻果凍產品則須在包裝上標示預防哽噎警告字句，提醒市民小心進食。

政府發言人表示：「雖然蒟蒻作為食物添加劑本身是安全的，但由於蒟蒻果凍的表面光滑而且質地結實，食用方法不當可能會帶來哽噎風險。這情況尤其容易發生在兒童和老人身上。政府一直透過不同渠道推廣預防食物哽噎的健康教育信息，例如呼籲消費者避免直接吸食迷你杯裝蒟蒻果凍。」

《修訂規例》於七月二十三日提交立法會，進行先訂立後審議程序。對預先包裝的蒟蒻果凍的新規定將在二○二六年四月一日實施，即《修訂規例》完成先訂立後審議程序約六個月後實施。

新規定包括：

一、屬預先包裝食物的果凍，如是以高度或闊度不超過45毫米的迷你杯狀容器包裝的，則不得含有蒟蒻；及
二、如屬預先包裝食物的、含有蒟蒻的果凍，其銷售包裝的最外層須以中文和英文清楚可閱地標明下述字樣——

「注意：勿一口吞食，長者及兒童須在監護下食用。
Caution: Do not swallow whole. Elderly and children must consume under supervision.」

​上述字樣須標明在有關包裝上的顯眼處，並以深色字印在淺色底上或以淺色字印在深色底上的方式標明，並須在字體下劃上底線；或以紅色字印在白色或黃色底上的方式標明。

食物安全中心（食安中心）會繼續加強預防哽噎的健康教育，包括向學校發信、舉辦講座以及在社交媒體上發布資訊。此外，食安中心將會安排與業界進行技術會議，以及發出使用指引，方便業界理解和遵守新的要求。"

  Compared with the grading released last week, Clear Water Bay First Beach, Middle Bay Beach and Silverstrand Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1, and Casam Beach and Ma Wan Tung Wan Beach from Grade 3 to Grade 2.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

Note 1: Lifesaving services are provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department at 21 gazetted beaches, marked with an asterisk (*) above, from June 1. For details, please refer to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's Special Announcement (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/beach/index.html).

Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 gazetted,2025-07-18 16:00,2025-07-18 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800533.htm,"The Government today (July 18) gazetted the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 (Amendment Regulation) to strengthen the regulation of prepackaged konjac-containing jelly confectionery.

Through legislative amendments, mini-cup konjac-containing jelly confectionery with a height or width not exceeding 45 millimetres will be prohibited for sale in the market. In addition, other konjac jelly products must be labelled with choking warning statements on their packaging to remind consumers to exercise caution while eating.

A Government spokesman said, ""While konjac itself is a safe food additive, the smooth and slippery surface and firm texture of konjac jellies may pose a choking risk if not consumed properly. This risk is particularly high for children and the elderly. The Government has been promoting health education messages on the prevention of food choking through various channels, such as advising consumers to avoid slurping mini-cup konjac-containing jelly confectionery directly.""

The Amendment Regulation will be tabled before the Legislative Council on July 23 for negative vetting. The new requirements for prepackaged mini-cup konjac-containing jelly confectionery will take effect on April 1, 2026, i.e. around six months after the completion of negative vetting of the Amendment Regulation.

The new regulatory requirements include:

(i) Jelly confectionery that is prepackaged food and that is packed in a mini-cup-shaped container must not contain konjac if the height or width of the container does not exceed 45mm; and

(ii) The outermost layer of packaging for sale of jelly confectionery that is prepackaged food and that contains konjac must be clearly and legibly marked with the following words in both Chinese and English -

""Caution: Do not swallow whole. Elderly and children must consume under supervision.
æ³¨æï¼å¿ä¸å£åé£ï¼é·èååç«¥éå¨ç£è­·ä¸é£ç¨ã""

The above words must be marked in a conspicuous position on the packaging. They must be underlined and marked in dark colour on a light-coloured background or in light colour on a dark-coloured background; or marked in red text on a white or yellow background.

The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) will continue to enhance health education on choking prevention, including issuing letters to schools, organising seminars, and sharing information on social media. In addition, the CFS will arrange technical meetings with the trade and issue user guidelines in due course to facilitate the trade's understanding of and compliance with the new requirements."

  ""The approved OZP provides a statutory land use planning framework to guide the development and redevelopment within the Tsuen Wan area"", a spokesman for the Town Planning Board said today (July 18).

The planning scheme area, covering about 743.48 hectares, includes Tsuen Wan Valley and its adjoining areas and forms part of the Tsuen Wan New Town. The area extends from Wo Yi Hop Road in the east to Yau Kom Tau in the west.

運輸及物流局局長出席立法會交通事務委員會就規管網絡預約出租汽車服務的立法建議的開場發言（只有中文）,2025-07-18 15:38,2025-07-18 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800667.htm,"​以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（七月十八日）出席立法會交通事務委員就規管網絡預約出租汽車服務的立法建議的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

經網約平台預約個人化點對點服務的出行模式在世界各地已相當普及，香港亦不例外。今屆特區政府抱着破局的決心，踏出重要一步，解決這個十一年多的爭議。政府提出的規管網約車服務框架，將市民利益放在首位，目標是讓市民出行更加安全，有更多選擇、更優質的點對點交通服務。同時，點對點服務的其中一個重要持份者就是司機，我們亦會兼顧司機的生意，促進點對點交通服務整體健康、平穩和有序發展，希望為整個行業帶來全新氣象。

網約車的議題複雜，牽涉不同考慮因素和不同利益，不同持份者的意見紛陳。我們聽到不少人認為網約車服務質素相對的士較好，但也聽到亦有很多市民都習慣了在街截的士，或者去的士站截的士，以切合他們的出行需要，帶來一定程度的方便。不過，就算有不同意見，有一點社會上的共識是非常明顯清晰的，就是政府應該早日規管網約車服務，以保障乘客安全和權益，滿足和便利市民出行需要，並為個人化點對點交通服務市場締造一個良性的競爭環境。正因如此，今天我們提出的建議，就是希望在這個共識的基礎上建立規管框架，以便在下一步聚焦處理其他技術細節或社會上存在較多不同意見的課題。

網約車的發展涉及多方面的平衡，包括最重要當然是乘客的安全和保障、公共交通系統效率、道路容量管理、剛才特別提到司機的生意，以及的士業界和網約車平台兩者的競爭互動環境，絕非簡單一刀切就能簡單解決。我們必須制定一套能夠全面保障乘客安全、令公共交通系統保持高效運作的制度。我相信這個亦是市民期望政府和立法會各位同事能努力一起做到。

的士與網約車不是「零和博奕」，而是共存互補。在行政長官本周初提到的七項大原則下，我們致力構建一個促進良性競爭的經營環境，讓的士和網約車行業各自發揮優勢，共同提升香港點對點服務的水平。文件羅列了我們很多分析和考慮，我在此不重複。不過我也想特別強調三點。第一，我們提出的框架，其中一個目標是希望做到有效規管網約車服務的同時，亦不會窒礙將來業界的發展。我們會要求平台符合指定的入場門檻，包括營運經驗、財力證明和資本投入。我相信大家都會認同，這會有助確保將來的營運商具備合適的能力，提供優質服務。我們亦要求平台在港註冊、建立本地管理團隊、就車輛和司機進行盡職審查、監察服務質素、確保資訊安全，以及向政府提交必需的營運數據。平台服務表現將納入政府運輸署作為監管者的中期評估，確保合規與持續改善。這些牌照要求與其他城市做法相若，目的是為保障乘客安全和利益。因此，我相信清晰的規管框架對平台公司是最重要，亦透過平台之間的競爭令服務進步，惠及市民。我們初步估計，也有接觸一些現在營運的平台公司，或者有興趣營運的公司，我們認為按我們在所提出的大框架之下就平台方面的要求和資格，估計日後大概會有數個網約車平台公司能夠符合申請資格和入場門檻，可以在香港提供服務。

第二，我想強調的是，我們建議的規管框架的另一目的，是透過為網約車平台、車輛和司機引入牌證要求，從而締造良性競爭環境，消除不確定性，讓的士業界和網約車可以平穩並存發展。這亦回應的士業界一直以來的重要訴求。首先，的士營運優勢，包括街上截乘、的士站、24小時營運不變；其次，正如特首提出的七大原則中很重要的一點，就是我們希望透過這個規管網約服務的框架，能夠為的士業界營造和提供一個新的網約營運的環境，亦可以提升他們提供的網約服務。另一方面，目前不少司機在一些不合法的情況下提供服務。如果能夠提供一個合法合規的情況，不單是司機提供服務時會放心，市民也會安心。

第三，關於大家都關注的網約車牌照數字。要思考這個複雜的問題，起點必然是香港現行得來不易的高效公共交通系統。香港城市發展密度高，高效的公共交通系統至為重要。現在每日有近九成的市民透過公交出行，比例位居世界前列。政府需要審慎制訂網約車牌照的發放總量，以免因供應過多引發交通堵塞或惡性競爭，例如我們不會想看到市民有車坐，但只是把時間都花在路上塞車，或因供應過量造成內卷或帶來惡性競爭，例如割喉式減價，反而令整體司機生意受影響等等。不過我也要強調，提供網約車的規管框架，正正希望能令市民的乘車體驗得到提升，亦可以方便召車，所以我們會多聽意見，亦是一個需要多角度審慎思考和論證的課題。有了一個清晰的規管框架，令不同的持份者都有一個清晰的基礎去提供意見，我相信當我們進一步討論的時候，就會更加聚焦和具體。

在訂定網約車服務數字時，可以和大家分享，我們會考慮多個因素，包括市民的召車體驗、平台營運需要包括營運模式，或從事提供服務的司機的營運模式、公共交通運作的效率，以及道路承載力等。政府當然會持續監察市場運作、市民回饋、業界的意見，適時考量這個問題，日後會適時檢視整個供應和發牌的細節。

政府會邀請交通諮詢委員會工作小組由現在至八月中繼續收集的士業界、網約車平台公司及市民的意見，並適當地在主體法例修訂中反映。今日的立法會交通事務委員會是一個重要的場合，容許我們能夠聽到各位議員提供的寶貴意見。如果今日得到交通事務委員會原則上的支持，我們會爭分奪秒，馬不停蹄，籌備我們的法例修訂工作。目標是在今年第三季向立法會提交主體法例修訂，爭取於本立法年度內完成審議法律程序，訂明原則性和大框架事宜。

至於其他技術細節，包括對平台、車輛和司機在營運模式、硬件配套和相關牌證要求等事宜，我們會繼續和各持分者聚焦討論磋商，並適當地納入附屬法例的修訂或之後的牌證條件當中。

主席，我們相信，透過這套規管制度，市民將享有更加安全、更多選擇、更高質素的出行服務，而的士業界以至整體點對點服務行業亦可以持續健康發展。我和團隊的工作目標和原則、願望，是求共識、找共通、取平衡，以民為本，做到安心出行，行業可以並存互補、持續發展。我們非常樂意聽取議員的意見和解答議員的提問，謝謝！"
Speech by SCST at completion ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Museum Jockey Club Anchor Plaza (English only),2025-07-18 15:10,2025-07-18 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800506.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the completion ceremony of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum Jockey Club Anchor Plaza today (July 18):

Mr Hext (Chairman of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum, Mr Richard Hext), Mr Hunsworth (Steward of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, Mr Nicholas D Hunsworth), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. As they say, weathering choppy waters is perhaps the trick of the trade of the maritime industry. So, here we are, a trail to our professionalism. It is my great pleasure to join you all today at the completion ceremony of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum Jockey Club Anchor Plaza. Even despite the weather, it is worth taking a good look at our anchor and hearing what Richard will have to say later, introducing what the Anchor's importance is. 

Founded in 2005, the Hong Kong Maritime Museum has long been preserving and promoting the unique maritime history and culture of Hong Kong. As it approaches its 20th anniversary this year, the Maritime Museum's journey has been remarkable. From its origins at Murray House in Stanley to its current home at Central Pier No. 8, the Museum has evolved into a cultural treasure, showcasing an impressive collection of maritime heritage, welcoming around 100000 visitors every year, and establishing itself as a vital maritime landmark in Hong Kong over the past two decades. I am also glad to know that the Hong Kong Maritime Museum has been increasingly popular among tourists, with over 20000 visitors from the Mainland of China and overseas recorded just last year.

Today, I am delighted to witness the completion of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum Jockey Club Anchor Plaza, one of the Chief Executive's Community Projects. This milestone, achieved after years of dedicated efforts, represents an exciting new chapter in the development of the Museum. Featuring a striking anchor about 7 metres high and a ship-like pavilion, the Anchor Plaza will provide a brand-new public learning space, inviting visitors to explore Hong Kong's maritime culture while adding yet another vibrant attraction to the iconic Victoria Harbour. I believe that the Anchor Plaza will draw more people to come and appreciate Hong Kong's unique history and culture as a port city.

The next part of my speech is actually to give you an idea of what we give to have the museum and the support to the arts and culture scenes. But I think you would rather hear from Richard the story of the Anchor than listen to my speech. So I'm sure when I issue it as the press release, you will be able to learn about it.

As you are all aware, the Government has been sparing no effort in fostering the development of arts and culture in recent years. Museums play an important role in preserving and disseminating cultural heritage. Apart from continuously improving public museum services, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department have been actively providing robust support for private institutions like the Hong Kong Maritime Museum. From thematic exhibitions like ""Across Victoria Harbour"" that revisit the past of Hong Kong, to the upcoming 2025 Forum for Asia-Pacific Maritime Culture to be held at the Museum, the Hong Kong Maritime Museum has played an integral role in enriching Hong Kong's cultural landscape and fostering international cultural exchange that complements the Government's work in a truly meaningful way.

In addition to support from the Government, the successful completion of the great Anchor Plaza and the remarkable achievements of the Museum would not be possible without the dedication of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum team and the unwavering support from the Hong Kong Jockey Club, other patrons of the Museum, and the wider community. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who has contributed to this project and to the ongoing growth of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum. Let's join hands to make lasting contributions to the cultural development of Hong Kong.

Let me wish the completion ceremony and the future of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum to weather through the choppy weather like right now, and I wish everybody a good day. Thank you."

This year's Hong Kong artists of the exhibition, Chris Cheung and Sim Shum, create a whimsical space using water stones as a medium, alongside sound, light and painting, combining the ancient legend of ""The Talking Stone of Weiyu"" about ""speaking stones"" from the Spring and Autumn period. The exhibition intertwines the themes of nature and humanity in an art space of sight and sound, offering audiences an immersive sensory experience of the environment.

 The Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale, held every three years, is one of the world's largest international outdoor art festivals. With the support of the Tsunan Town Government and in collaboration with the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale Executive Committee and the NPO Echigo-Tsumari Satoyama Collaborative Organization, the APO has launched the Hong Kong House in Tsunan, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, since 2018, serving as a platform for artist residencies, exchanges and exhibitions.

 Cheung and Shum were deeply touched by the uniquely shaped water stones of the Shinano River in Echigo-Tsumari, and their art works whisper the stories found in the lyrics of folk songs from the two places, diffusing emotions and memories. They referenced Morse code to develop a language system for the water stones and created the ink art work ""The Ode of Stone"" and the light installation ""The Shades of Stones"", facilitating interaction with audiences. The other two installations, ""The Book of Stones"" and ""The Blessings of Stone"" draw inspiration from the Japanese garden design concept ""Suikinkutsu"" and sacred stones.

 The artists will also organise workshops to guide participants in creating a light installation, projecting their inner thoughts into the space through light and shadows.

 In addition, the activity collaborator, Make A Difference Institute, will organise a community-based food culture project ""Minna no Tsukemono"", inviting participants to taste preserved foods from around the world.

三年一度的越後妻有大地藝術祭，是全球最大型的國際戶外藝術節之一。藝術推廣辦事處獲津南町政府的支持，與越後妻有大地藝術祭實行委員會及NPO法人越後妻有里山協働機構合作，自二○一八年起在當地推出香港部屋計劃，作為藝術家駐留、交流和展示的平台。

張瀚謙和沈君怡被越後妻有信濃川河邊形狀各異的水石深深觸動，他們的作品以輕聲呢喃的方式道出兩地民謠歌詞中故事，滲透出情感和記憶。兩位藝術家參考摩斯密碼的原理自創編制出一套水石的語言系統，並創作水墨作品《石誦》與燈光裝置《影石窟》，與觀眾互動交流。另外兩組裝置作品《言石窟》和《螢愿》靈感則分別源自於日本庭園設計中「水琴窟」和御神石的意念。

藝術家亦將舉辦工作坊，帶領參加者製作小型燈光裝置，把內心話語以光影投影到四周的空間。

活動夥伴創不同協作則以飲食為主題，策劃《大家の漬物》社區項目，邀請參加者品嚐來自世界各地的漬物。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

如就規管租賃事宜有疑問，可致電電話熱線（2150 8303）或瀏覽估價署網頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/our_services/part_iva.html）內的相關資訊。"
14 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-07-18 14:50,2025-07-18 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800631.htm,"  Fourteen landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7), pleaded guilty and were fined a total of $72,000 on July 11 and today (July 18) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 114 cases to date. Among the 778 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 675 SDU landlords with fines ranging from $400 to $41,600, amounting to a total of $2,016,810. In addition, 336 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 14 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; (2) failing to produce copies of the bills and provide an account in writing when requiring the tenant to pay for the reimbursement of the apportioned water and/or electricity charges; (3) failing to provide the tenant with a rent receipt; and (4) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance). One of the landlords committed 15 offences under (4) and was fined $16,500.

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon an in-depth investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to facilitate SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."

政府新聞處處長在青島出席「香港─沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽開幕禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-07-18 14:35,2025-07-18 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800605.htm,"以下是政府新聞處處長廖李可期今日（七月十八日）在青島出席「香港—沉浸式之旅」巡迴展覽開幕禮的致辭全文：

尊敬的張連三主任（山東省人民政府港澳事務辦公室主任）、趙燕副市長（青島市人民政府副市長）、宋仁登主任（青島市人民政府港澳事務辦公室主任）、潘峰局長（青島市文化和旅遊局局長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

早上好！歡迎大家出席由香港特別行政區政府新聞處主辦、駐山東聯絡處協辦的「香港─沉浸式之旅」展覽——青島站的開幕式。

這個展覽自二○二三年七月已經先後在印尼、泰國、馬來西亞，還有內地的廣州，跟阿聯酋迪拜舉行。今年適逢香港特別行政區舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」10周年，我們特別在內地三個「一帶一路」的節點城市舉行展覽：首站上月在上海圓滿舉行，吸引超過18萬名民眾參觀，今天我們在青島舉辦的是第二站，稍後將會移師成都舉行。

青島作為山東省最大的城市，經濟發達，魯港兩地一直優勢互補，互利共贏。一九九三年，青島啤酒成為首家來港上市的國企，此後試點逐漸擴大，香港成為內地企業首選的融資平台。而香港特區現在既是山東最大的外資來源地，佔全省利用外資總額70%，也是山東企業境外上市的首選地；截至去年底，在香港上市的山東企業已達56家，市值接近5,600億港元。

青島除經濟發達外，更是「一帶一路」新亞歐大陸橋經濟走廊主要節點城市和海上合作戰略支點，與香港經貿關係密切，兩地旅客的雙向奔赴也日漸頻繁。

去年三月，「個人遊」計劃適用城市擴展至青島市，讓青島市居民可更靈活和便捷地探索香港；除了可以加深兩地民眾的交流，為促進兩地文化交融、民心相通注入更大力量外，「個人遊」旅客亦是帶動香港旅遊相關業務的重要力量。青島市有過千萬人口，屬於萬億本地生產總值城市，相信可為香港帶來更多高增值過夜旅客。就此，在「個人遊」計劃擴展至青島市後，香港旅遊發展局積極在青島市推介香港。

事實上，香港跟青島之間距離雖遠，但實際上是近在咫尺：青港兩地之間每日有多班直航班次往返兩地，穿梭兩地只需要短短的三個多小時，實在是有非常好的條件繼續深化我們兩地在旅遊方面的合作，促進資源共享，推動客源互送。青島市政府上周就在香港舉辦了青島文化旅遊推介交流會，提供了一個很好的機會，讓青港兩地的文旅業界共同探討合作和發展。我期望青港兩地日後能建立更緊密的聯繫，進行更多不同方面的合作交流。

就此，我們期望透過今次展覽，吸引更多青島朋友認識香港、到訪香港。我們會向參觀人士展示香港的不同方面，包括「澎湃創意之都」、「國際金融中心」、「多元和綠色城市」、「盛事之都」等展區；我們以藝術投影方式，並透過裸眼3D和互動遊戲等藝術科技，全方位展示香港的文旅魅力和最新面貌。而我們今次的展覽更特別加入大熊貓的新元素，讓訪客與國寶大熊貓一同體驗香港的獨特魅力；並向參與我們特設的電子互動遊戲的民眾，送出精緻的紀念品，包括可愛大熊貓盲盒等。

此外，今年十一月，香港、廣東省跟澳門攜手合辦第十五屆全國運動會。香港很榮幸能為這高水準的國家體壇盛事承辦八個項目。展覽為此特別設置「體育動感之都」展區，作為全運會的預熱宣傳。而十五運會及殘特奧會吉祥物「喜洋洋」和「樂融融」今天亦在場，跟大家一起喜迎全運。

除了是次展覽外，新聞處一直透過不同的宣傳推廣方式，讓內地市民更加了解香港的最新發展。社交媒體平台就是一個非常重要的渠道。除了在優酷、微博及微信開設「香港品牌」帳號外，較早前我們也在小紅書特別開通了「香港政府新聞處添馬台」專業號，希望透過這個專業號，讓更多內地朋友接觸到香港的資訊，增加互動。為鼓勵到訪是次展覽的朋友透過我們的帳號分享參觀的體驗，我們在展覽期間亦會舉行「快拍留影」互動遊戲，兩名勝出者可獲得由國泰航空慷慨贊助的雙人來回青島至香港機票，希望大家踴躍參加。

是次展覽能在青島順利舉行，實有賴山東省及青島市人民政府港澳事務辦公室的鼎力支持，為我們在場地選址及宣傳等方面提供寶貴指導及協助，我在此表達衷心的謝意。我也特別感謝張主任特地從濟南來到青島，出席今天的開幕式，這充分顯示了山東省政府對魯港合作的支持和重視。

最後，我希望青島的朋友們會喜歡我們這個為您們策劃的展覽，感受香港的多元魅力。我亦再次感謝在座各位蒞臨今天的開幕式，並謹祝魯港兩地繁榮昌盛，大家身體健康、事事順利。多謝大家。"
Appointment of supervisory committee to conduct investigation into alleged misconduct of District Council member,2025-07-18 14:35,2025-07-18 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800532.htm,"  The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs (SHYA), Miss Alice Mak, appointed a supervisory committee today (July 18) to investigate alleged misconduct of Tuen Mun District Council (DC) member Mr Kenneth Yip Kat-kong.

  The Chairman and three members of the Tuen Mun DC initiated an investigation into Mr Yip's alleged misconduct pursuant to the District Councils Ordinance (Cap. 547) on July 15. The SHYA appointed a supervisory committee according to the Ordinance to conduct the investigation, and the five committee members are Mr Li Tak-hong, Ms Luparker Wong Shuk-fan, Mr Ng King-wah, Ms Janus Lau Yuen-yee, and Mr Lau Kar-wah. The supervisory committee will establish whether the facts on which the allegation is based are true; give its opinion on whether the established facts constitute grounds for imposing a sanction under section 72D of the Ordinance; and if there is ground for imposing a sanction, give its opinion on the appropriate sanction to be imposed on the DC member concerned. After completing the investigation, the supervisory committee will submit a report to the SHYA for consideration. The SHYA will make a decision after considering the report and announce such a decision in due course.

  Miss Mak said, ""The Government places strong emphasis on the conduct and integrity of DC members, and they should conduct themselves in a manner that is in line with public expectations and commensurate with the reputation of the DC and its members. Under the Ordinance, the Government may investigate DC members' misconduct and impose sanctions according to the performance monitoring mechanism for DC members to ensure that every DC member upholds their duties faithfully to serve the people.""

  Miss Mak continued, ""The five members of the supervisory committee include one person who is not a DC member and four DC members from districts other than Tuen Mun. They have diverse backgrounds and rich district experience. The supervisory committee will handle the investigation in a robust, fair, just, impartial, independent and objective manner in accordance with the established mechanism.""

  The supervisory committee was appointed pursuant to section 72C of the Ordinance. In order to avoid impacting the impartiality of the supervisory committee's investigation, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau will not comment on the case during the supervisory committee's investigation."
委任監察委員會就一宗區議員的指稱行為失當進行調查,2025-07-18 14:32,2025-07-18 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800531.htm,"民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（七月十八日）委任一個監察委員會就一宗涉及屯門區區議員葉吉江的指稱行為失當進行調查。

屯門區議會主席及三名屯門區區議員於七月十五日，根據《區議會條例》（第547章）（《條例》），就葉吉江議員的指稱行為失當發起調查。民青局局長根據《條例》委出監察委員會進行調查，五名成員為李德康、王淑芬、伍景華、劉婉儀及劉嘉華。監察委員會會確立有關指稱所基於的事實是否屬實；就已確立的事實是否構成根據《條例》第72D條施加處分的理由，給予意見；及如有施加處分的理由，就對有關議員應施加何種適當處分，給予意見。監察委員會在完成調查後將呈交調查報告予民青局局長考慮。民青局局長會在考慮委員會呈交的調查報告後作出裁決，並會適時作出公布。

麥美娟說：「政府非常重視區議員的品行和誠信操守，他們的言行應符合公眾期望及與區議會及區議員應有的聲譽相稱。在《條例》下，政府可根據區議員履職監察制度對作出失當行為的區議員作出調查及處罰，確保每一位區議員能盡忠職守、為居民服務。」

她續說：「監察委員會五名成員包括一位非擔任區議員的人士及四位屯門區外的區議會議員。他們來自不同界別，地區經驗豐富。監察委員會會以嚴謹態度，不偏不倚、公正持平、獨立及客觀的方式，按機制進行調查。」

監察委員會是根據《條例》第72C條委出。為免影響監察委員會調查工作的公平性，民青局在監察委員會進行調查工作期間不會就案件作出任何評論。"

運輸及物流局發言人表示：「粵港澳三地交通往來日趨頻繁，為方便駕駛者和更有效回應與日俱增的跨境出行需求，政府一直積極提升運輸署的相關牌證服務。《修訂規例》將優化申領程序及要求，我們預計將會為常規配額計劃、『港車北上』以及近日公布的『粵車南下』的申請人／持證人減少和簡化程序，讓他們更感方便。」

《修訂規例》主要修訂建議包括：

（一）封閉道路通行許可證：把跨境車輛的許可證的最長有效期由十二個月延長至六十個月，並調整許可證的費用至收回成本水平；以及按照風險可控的考量，豁免參與個別符合要求的跨境駕駛計劃的車輛申請許可證。由於許可證將予豁免或許可證有效期將會延長，一般而言，用家需繳付的許可證費用將會減少；及

（二）國際通行許可證：推出電子許可證，簡化申領流程，申請人可於網上提交申請和證明文件，以及領取電子許可證並自行列印。

政府已分別就上述許可證的優化安排諮詢立法會交通事務委員會，獲委員普遍支持。《修訂規例》將於七月二十三日提交立法會進行先訂立後審議的程序。視乎立法會的審議，《修訂規例》下有關封閉道路通行許可證的豁免安排及國際通行許可證的優化措施將於今年十月一日生效；而有關封閉道路通行許可證的延長有效期安排及費用調整將於明年一月一日生效。運輸署將會繼續優化各項跨境通行措施，為香港市民和跨境旅客提供更佳的出行體驗。"

灣區辦首次在西安舉辦大灣區研討會（附圖）,2025-07-18 12:45,2025-07-18 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800383.htm,"粵港澳大灣區發展辦公室（灣區辦）今日（七月十八日）於西安舉辦「港通大灣區午宴研討會」，向陝西企業推廣粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）建設的龐大機遇及香港北部都會區的發展潛力，超過260名參加者出席。

粵港澳大灣區發展專員陳潔玲為研討會發表視像致辭。她表示，為充分發揮香港內聯外通的優勢，灣區辦除了到海外進行宣傳推廣，亦加強對內連結，主動到不同內地城市推廣大灣區的發展機遇。以位於中國正中部、國家中心城市之一的西安作為首站是大灣區「北上賦能」，聯通絲綢之路經濟帶的重要一步。在中央支持及灣區城市的共同努力下，大灣區經濟實力與競爭力持續提升，正邁向國際一流灣區目標。香港作為大灣區中心城市和區域核心引擎，憑藉「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，是陝西企業開拓大灣區、布局全球的理想夥伴。她鼓勵企業落戶香港，善用香港的國際化平台走向世界。

粵港澳大灣區發展副專員馮雅慧在研討會上發表題為「大灣區發展機遇和香港優勢助力陝西企業灣通四海」的主題演講。她指出，大灣區在國家發展中戰略意義重大，為陝西及全球企業帶來無限商機。香港在「一國兩制」下，擁有高度市場化、國際化和法治化的一流營商環境，在金融服務、創新科技、貿易與物流等方面優勢明顯。隨着陝港合作進一步深化，香港的獨特優勢將能與陝西扎實的產業基礎和科技創新活力緊密結合，共同推動兩地實現互惠共贏、資源互補，為國家高質量發展注入新動能。

北部都會區統籌辦事處副主任翁佩雲在研討會上介紹，北部都會區對接國家發展戰略，毗鄰深圳、面向國際，能助力粵港澳大灣區成為世界級的一流灣區，也為陝西的企業帶來發展空間和投資機會。特區政府會繼續以「產業導向」規劃和落實北部都會區，並採用包括「片區開發」的多元土地批撥模式，吸引人才和資源集聚香港，讓北部都會區成為香港經濟增長的新引擎。

今日的研討會由灣區辦、香港特別行政區政府駐陝西聯絡處及陝西省人民政府港澳事務辦公室合辦。研討會還設問答環節促進交流，讓與會者深入了解大灣區及香港北部都會區的發展潛力，為兩地企業搭建高價值交流平台。"

衞生署提醒市民天灸療法應由合資格中醫師進行,2025-07-18 11:30,2025-07-18 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800337.htm,"衞生署今日（七月十八日）提醒市民，天灸療法是中醫針灸學灸法的一種，應由合資格的中醫師進行，以免引致不適，甚至加重病情或受傷。

天灸療法是透過藥物刺激特定穴位，從而疏通經絡、調整氣血，達致防治疾病之效。天灸療法臨床上可應用於多種病症，例如慢性支氣管炎、哮喘、過敏性鼻炎、月經不調、關節疼痛等。

今年「三伏天」由七月二十日（星期日）開始，至八月十八日（星期一）結束。不少市民會在「三伏天」期間進行天灸，稱為「三伏天灸」，以期獲得更佳療效。

在香港，天灸應由具專業資格的中醫師操作。衞生署呼籲市民在接受天灸療法前，應先由合資格的中醫師評估身體狀況，以判斷是否適合接受療程。有部分人士可能不適合接受天灸，例如兩歲以下幼兒、孕婦、中醫辨證屬熱證的患者等。

市民在接受天灸療法前，應先確認服務提供者的中醫師資格，切勿隨便讓未經醫療專業註冊或認可的人士施行天灸。此類人士的專業資格和水平未獲確認，提供的服務安全性和治療效用存疑，有可能加重病情或令接受治療的人受傷。市民如對香港中醫的執業資格有疑慮，可要求有關人士出示相關證明文件。註冊及表列中醫名單已上載至香港中醫藥管理委員會網頁（www.cmchk.org.hk），供公眾查閱。

此外，在接受天灸療法前，亦應先了解清楚治療程序、潛在風險和注意事項等。如在進行天灸療法期間感到不適，應立即尋求醫護人員的診治。"

勞工處發言人今日（七月十八日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-07-18 11:17,2025-07-18 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800408.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (July 18) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

早晨主席、各位委員。我首先想感謝各位立法會議員，特別是房屋事務委員會的委員，給予我們很多寶貴意見，令我們處理劣質「劏房」問題和「簡樸房」條例時，有很多很實在的意見，使我們做起來時真的可以配合民情，亦了解實際需要。

本屆政府大力興建公營房屋，未來十年308 000個公營房屋目標很清晰，我們有約二萬個過渡性房屋、約三萬個「簡約公屋」，這些就是我們擁有的「底氣」，處理這個困擾香港已久的難題。這個難題我們一直沒有看輕其難度及其複雜性。所以正如主席所言，我們過往進行了許多公眾諮詢，亦收集了許多公眾意見。多謝專業團體，以及很多團體、社福機構，提供很多很寶貴的看法給我們。

我們很努力，亦有決心將這些意見好好分析，並吸納在現時所建議的法例框架。其實這個條例草案正正就是以一個立法形式定立一個立法框架，為市場希望繼續經營這些分間單位的經營者提供一些清晰的標準和要求。

我們會全力配合立法會法案委員會的工作，希望可以盡快得到大家支持，通過法例。我們的目標是在二○二六年三月一日開始，正式推行「簡樸房」規管制度，讓香港真正走出這個我們常常不想再看到的劣質「劏房」問題、這個社會的「痛點」，真正稱得上告別劣質「劏房」。

現在，我交給身旁的副秘書長王女士（房屋局副秘書長（特別職務）王明慧），她會簡介條例細節。

多謝主席。"
Human Reproductive Technology (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 and Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 2) Notice 2025 gazetted,2025-07-18 11:04,2025-07-18 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800353.htm,"  The Government published the Human Reproductive Technology (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 (Amendment Regulation) and the Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 2) Notice 2025 (Notice) in the Gazette today (July 18) to give effect to the relevant recommendations on the regulation of human reproductive technology by the Council on Human Reproductive Technology.

The Amendment Regulation

  At present, under the Human Reproductive Technology (Licensing) Regulation (Cap. 561A) (Regulation), gametes or embryos for own use can generally be stored for at most 10 years. For patients who may be rendered infertile as a result of medical treatments, the maximum storage period of embryos for own use is 10 years, and that of gametes for own use is 10 years or until the patient reaches 55 years of age, whichever is longer.

  The Amendment Regulation aims to remove the statutory storage periods of gametes and embryos for own use under the Regulation to enable members of the public to make their own decisions on the storage duration of their gametes or embryos depending on their health and other conditions, with a view to better realising reproductive autonomy.

The Notice

  The Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance (Cap. 561) (Ordinance) prohibits the use of reproductive technology procedures for selecting the sex of an embryo, except where such selection is to avoid a sex-linked genetic disease specified in Schedule 2 to the Ordinance, which may prejudice the health of the embryo. The Notice aims to update the list of diseases set out in Schedule 2 to the Ordinance.

  The Amendment Regulation and the Notice will be laid before the Legislative Council (LegCo) on July 23 (next Wednesday) for negative vetting. Subject to the approval of the LegCo, they will come into operation on December 1.

  Furthermore, the Council will amend the Code of Practice on Reproductive Technology and Embryo Research (Code) accordingly, which will come into effect at the same time as the Amendment Regulation and the Notice. Among these, to ensure that members of the public are fully informed of the associated medical risks and the trade-offs involved before engaging in the storage of gametes or embryos for their own use, the Council will incorporate relevant operational measures in the amended Code, including requiring persons who have stored their gametes or embryos for their own use for five years or more to receive additional counselling services before storage can be extended. There will be a one-year grace period for the relevant arrangements, whereby persons concerned only need to complete the counselling services and extension procedures within one year, or before their first storage extension, after the commencement of the amended Code (whichever is later). The Council will inform the licensed centres of the detailed subsequent arrangements for the commencement of the aforementioned amendments in a timely manner."

《修訂規例》

現時，根據《人類生殖科技（牌照）規例》（第561A章）（《規例》），供自用的配子或胚胎一般最多可儲存10年。就因接受醫學治療而可能導致喪失生育能力的病人而言，供自用的胚胎的儲存期限為10年，而供自用的配子的儲存期限則為10年或直到病人年滿55歲（以較長者為準）。

《修訂規例》旨在取消《規例》下供自用的配子和胚胎的法定儲存期限，讓市民因應自身健康及其他情況決定配子或胚胎的儲存時間，更好地體現生育自主權。

《公告》

《人類生殖科技條例》（第561章）（《條例》）禁止藉生殖科技程序選擇胚胎的性別，除非進行選擇是為避免《條例》附表2所列的可能損害胚胎健康的伴性遺傳疾病。《公告》旨在更新《條例》附表2所載列的疾病清單。

《修訂規例》和《公告》將於七月二十三日（下周三）提交立法會按先訂立後審議的程序省覽，如獲立法會通過，將於十二月一日生效。

此外，管理局會對《生殖科技及胚胎研究實務守則》（《實務守則》）進行相應修訂，修訂的《實務守則》將與《修訂規例》和《公告》同時生效。其中，為確保市民在儲存供自用的配子或胚胎前充分了解相關醫療風險及當中的取捨，管理局會在修訂的《實務守則》中加入相關執行措施，包括要求儲存供自用的配子或胚胎滿五年的人士接受額外的輔導服務，方可延長儲存。有關額外輔導服務安排將設一年的寬限期，即相關人士只須在修訂的《實務守則》生效後一年內，或首次延長儲存前（以較遲者為準），完成輔導服務和續期程序即可。管理局會適時通知持牌中心以上修訂生效後的詳細後續安排。"

New round of applications for Common Recruitment Examination opens tomorrow,2025-07-18 11:00,2025-07-18 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/18/P2025071800256.htm,"  A new round of the Common Recruitment Examination (CRE) will open for applications from tomorrow (July 19). Prospective applicants for civil service posts at the degree or professional level should apply through the online application system on the Civil Service Bureau (CSB) webpage.

The application details for the CRE will be uploaded to the CSB webpage (www.csb.gov.hk/eng/cre.html) tomorrow. The deadline for online applications is 11.59pm on August 1.

  A spokesman for the CSB reminded persons planning to apply for civil service posts at the degree or professional level in the near future that they are required to have valid CRE results and should make use of the opportunity to take part in this round of examination, tentatively scheduled to be held on September 27.

  The pool of eligible candidates for civil service jobs requiring an undergraduate degree has been expanded to students in their third year of undergraduate studies (in a four-year curriculum). Therefore, holders of a degree, or a professional qualification meeting the entry requirements of the posts, or undergraduate students graduating in the academic year of 2025/26 or 2026/27 may apply.

  The CRE consists of three papers, namely the Use of Chinese (UC), the Use of English (UE) and the Aptitude Test (AT). Applicants may choose to take any of the CRE papers in the coming examination. Results in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSEE) or other specified public examinations are accepted as equivalents to different levels of results for the UC and the UE. If applicants have attained the specified results in the language subjects concerned in the HKDSEE or other specified public examinations, they will not be arranged to take the UC and/or UE paper(s). Please visit the CSB webpage for the specified results and the language subjects concerned. Applicants should note that different civil service posts have different Chinese and English language proficiency requirements. No public examination results are accepted as being equivalent to the AT. Applicants for some civil service posts at the degree or professional level are required to obtain a pass result in the AT paper in order to be eligible for applying for the posts concerned.
           
Prospective candidates for civil service posts of degree or professional grades should also attend the Digitalised Basic Law and National Security Law Test (Degree/Professional Grades) (BLNST) at the Recruitment Centre, General Grades Office of the CSB as soon as possible. For details, please visit the website (www.csb.gov.hk/eng/dblnst.html). Attaining a pass result in the BLNST is an entry requirement for all civil service jobs.

For the convenience of those studying or residing outside Hong Kong, the CRE and the paper-based Basic Law and National Security Law Test (Degree/Professional Grades) are tentatively scheduled to be held on November 29 in Beijing, Shanghai, London, New York, Toronto, Vancouver and Sydney. Applications will open later this year.

The RFE Scheme will offer licence applicants of general restaurants, light refreshment restaurants, food factories (whether or not for preparation of bakery products only), factory canteens and composite food shops an additional option. Applicants may continue with the established practice of using the fire safety risk assessment and certification services of the Fire Services Department (FSD) or engage the services of RFEs. To tie in with the implementation of the Scheme, the Government made the Fire Services Department (Reports and Certificates) (Amendment) Regulation 2025 to revamp the fee structure for FSD services, including the fees for the issue of certificates for ventilating systems by the FSD prescribed in the Fire Services Department (Reports and Certificates) Regulations (Cap. 95C).

In view of the revamp of the fee structure for FSD services, the Amendment Regulation will specify the corresponding fee deduction for the issue of certificates for ventilating systems by the FSD from the fees for the granting of full food business licences, so that applicants will not be double charged for the same service.

The Government will table the Amendment Regulation before the Legislative Council at its sitting on July 23. Upon the completion of negative vetting, the Amendment Regulation will come into effect with the revamped fee structure for FSD services on November 1, 2025."

註冊消防工程師計劃將為申請普通食肆、小食食肆、食物製造廠（不論是否只配製烘焙食品者）、工廠食堂和綜合食物店牌照的人士提供多一個選擇，讓他們可自行選擇繼續使用消防處的消防安全風險評估和發出證明書的服務，或聘請註冊消防工程師提供上述服務。為實施計劃，政府訂立了《2025年消防處（報告及證明書）（修訂）規例》，以重整消防處的收費架構，包括在《消防處（報告及證明書）規例》（第95C章）列明由消防處發出通風系統證明書的費用。

因應消防處收費架構的重整，《修訂規例》相應從食物業新批出正式牌照的費用中扣除消防處發出通風系統證明書的收費，以避免牌照申請人就同一服務支付雙重費用。

政府會在七月二十三日把《修訂規例》提交立法會席上省覽，待完成先訂立後審議的程序後，《修訂規例》將配合消防處的收費架構重整於二○二五年十一月一日同時生效。"
