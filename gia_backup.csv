HKPF launches Traffic Fixed Penalty Notices Digitalisation (with photo),2025-06-15 10:53,2025-06-15 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/15/P2025061500344.htm," The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) officially launched the digitalisation of Fixed Penalty Notices (penalty tickets) (“FPNs’’) today (June 15). Penalty tickets for illegal parking and moving traffic offences will now be issued electronically. Additionally, the “eTraffic Ticket Platform” (“the Platform”) thematic portal and mobile application have also been launched. Vehicle owners and drivers can now verify and manage penalty tickets conveniently.

The HKPF will issue electronic penalty tickets (ePTs) according to the verified e-contact means (ECM) submitted by offenders to the Transport Department – SMS tickets for those who have provided a Hong Kong mobile phone number, and email tickets for those who have provided an email address. The HKPF will continue to issue printed paper penalty tickets to those that have not submitted their verified ECMs.

At the initial stage of implementation, the HKPF adopts a “dual-track” transitional arrangement. Offenders will receive both ePTs and printed paper tickets, and they are only required to settle their fines using either one. As the “dual-track” arrangement is a transitional measure, members of the public are encouraged to use ePTs. 

The HKPF has launched the Platform thematic portal (www.etrafficticket.gov.hk) and mobile application. Members of the public can view and verify penalty tickets, and settle their fines using electronic payment methods (e.g. Faster Payment System, credit cards, etc.) on the Platform. The HKPF has also updated the formats of penalty tickets to include new payment information and methods. For details, please refer to the attachment.

The HKPF also appeals to the public with the following anti-deception tips:
- All SMS tickets are issued under the SMS sender name “#HKPF-eTT”. Therefore, if the purported SMS ticket was not sent under this sender name, it must be fake;
- All SMS or email tickets do not contain any hyperlinks. Members of the public should stay vigilant and avoid clicking on any suspicious hyperlinks or providing any personal information; and
- The Platform’s thematic portal has a domain ending with “.gov.hk”. Websites that do not end with “.gov.hk” are not government official websites.

The HKPF will monitor the progress of digitalising FPNs and public’s adaptation over time. Feedback will be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of the “dual-track” arrangement and the future expansion of the Platform’s functions. 

For more details of the digitalisation of FPNs, please visit the Platform thematic portal or download its mobile application."

16間香港生命科學及健康科技公司連同投資推廣署及香港科技園公司組成代表團，參加全球最具規模的生物科技盛會BIO 2025國際生物科技大會，活動將於六月十六日至十九日（波士頓時間）在波士頓會議展覽中心舉行。這次投資推廣署和香港科技園公司聯合參與活動，旨在攜手把香港蓬勃發展的生物科技生態系統推廣至國際的舞台上。

代表團將於場內的香港展館中，向有意拓展至粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）及亞太市場的美國生物科技公司展示香港無可比擬的優勢與機遇。投資推廣署將與來自世界各地的業界先驅建立聯繫，分享真知灼見並促進合作機會，突顯香港作為生物科技樞紐的戰略優勢。透過全方位的簡報、一對一交流及互動展示，代表團將重點宣傳香港尖端的生態系統，協助美國生物科技企業在亞洲快速增長的市場中蓬勃發展。

投資推廣署助理署長吳國才表示：「在全球經濟不明朗和面對前所未有挑戰的背景下，企業愈加重視韌性、多元化與創新意念。香港作為全球生物科技樞紐，以及全球其中一個領先的生命科學與生物科技融資中心，為美國生物科技公司提供獨特優勢，包括頂尖學術研究與人才庫、世界級研發基礎設施、雄厚的金融實力、健全的知識產權保護、高質素的臨床試驗數據，以及政府的堅定支持，促使香港成為設立地區總部、拓展大灣區及亞太市場的理想地點。」

香港科技園公司行政總裁黃克強表示：「美國是全球最大的醫療市場。科技公司若要在美國市場取得成功，必須了解當地醫療體系的運作，並有效向投資者傳達其研發能力的獨特價值。這次訪問的目標不僅是尋求即時的投資，更是建立兩地創新生態系統的長期橋樑，提供一個互相交流、合作和擴大業務規模的全球互聯環境。我預期代表團在未來十二至十八個月內將開始見到具體成果。」

 香港的生物科技產業由智慧醫院及遠距醫療等創新意念所驅動，為日益上升的醫療需求提供可持續的解決方案。香港特別行政區政府正透過在港深創新及科技園設立「InnoLife Healthtech Hub生命健康創新科研中心」提升本地水平。二○二四年《施政報告》亦推出100億港元的「創科產業引導基金」，以引導資金投放至包括生命與健康科技在內的策略性產業。

大灣區為美國生物科技公司帶來重大機遇。獲指定的大灣區醫療機構可使用已在香港註冊並獲公立醫院批准的藥物與醫療器械，截至二○二五年四月三十日，廣東省藥品監督管理局已批准51種藥物及63項醫療器械。此外，香港交易所於二○一八年改革《上市規則》，使尚未盈利的生物科技公司亦可在主板上市，進一步鞏固香港作為生物科技首次公開招股領先市場的地位。

投資推廣署吸引創新及科技公司來港設立或擴展業務的勢頭強勁。二○二四年，投資推廣署協助的創科公司數量增至120間，較二○二三年的82間大幅上升，是該署支援最多的行業，反映全球對香港創新生態系統的信心日增，以及香港作為進入中國內地及亞太市場的跳板的戰略角色。

BIO 2025國際生物科技大會匯聚超過二萬名全球業界領袖，幾乎涵蓋整個生物科技生態圈。在這個充滿變革的時代，生物科技正革新醫療、農業與環境可持續發展，為全球挑戰帶來希望與解決方案。"

InvestHK promotes Hong Kong's biotech edge at BIO International Convention 2025,2025-06-15 10:00,2025-06-15 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/15/P2025061300713.htm,"The Head of Innovation & Technology at Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), Mr Andy Wong, will embark on a duty visit to the United States from tomorrow (June 16) to June 20 to engage with local biotech stakeholders, start-ups, investors and media with the aim of attracting more business and investment into Hong Kong.

 A delegation of 16 Hong Kong life science and health technology companies will be joining InvestHK and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) to the BIO International Convention 2025, the world's premier biotechnology event, running June 16 to 19 (Boston time) at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center. This joint effort underscores the strong partnership between InvestHK and the HKSTP to promote Hong Kong's vibrant biotech ecosystem on a global stage.

 At the Hong Kong pavilion, the delegation will showcase the city's unrivalled advantages and opportunities for American biotech companies seeking to expand into the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and Asia Pacific. InvestHK will connect with global industry pioneers, sharing insights and forging partnerships to spotlight Hong Kong's strategic strengths as a biotech powerhouse. Through dynamic presentations, one-on-one discussions, and interactive showcases, InvestHK will highlight the city's cutting-edge ecosystem, which is tailored to empower American biotech firms to thrive in Asia's fast-growing markets.

 Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Charles Ng said, ""Amid a climate of global economic uncertainty and unprecedented challenges, businesses are increasingly focused on resilience, diversification, and innovation. Hong Kong, as a global biotech hub and one of the world's leading fundraising hubs for life science and biotech, offers unique advantages for American biotechnology companies. These include a top-tier academic research and talent pool, world-class research and development infrastructure, financial strength, robust intellectual property protection, high-quality clinical trial data and strong government commitment. All these make Hong Kong an ideal location for establishing a regional headquarters to expand into the GBA and Asia-Pacific region.""

  The Chief Executive Officer of the HKSTP, Mr Albert Wong, said, ""The United States is the world's largest healthcare market. For technology companies to succeed in the US market, it is essential to understand how the local healthcare system operates and effectively communicates the unique value of their R&D capabilities to investors. The goal of this visit goes beyond seeking immediate investment - it is also about building long-term bridges between innovation ecosystems; offering a globally connected environment to exchange ideas, collaborate and scale. I expect the delegation will begin to see tangible results within the next 12 to 18 months.""

 Hong Kong's biotech sector is driven by innovations such as smart hospitals and telehealth, addressing rising healthcare demands with sustainable solutions. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is enhancing the city's capabilities through the establishment of the InnoLife Healthtech Hub in the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park. The 2024 Policy Address also introduced a HK$10 billion I&T Industry-Oriented Fund to channel investment into strategic industries, including life and health technology.

 The GBA presents significant opportunities for American biotech firms. Designated GBA healthcare institutions can utilise Hong Kong-registered drugs and medical devices approved for public hospitals, with 51 drugs and 63 medical devices having been allowed by the Guangdong Provincial Medical Products Administration as of April 30, 2025. Additionally, the Listing Rules reform by the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has positioned it as a leading exchange for biotech initial public offerings, enabling pre-revenue biotech companies to list on the main board and access robust capital markets.

 InvestHK has seen strong momentum in attracting innovation and technology (I&T) companies to establish or expand their presence in the city. In 2024, the number of I&T companies assisted by InvestHK rose to 120, up from 82 in 2023, making it the top-performing sector among all sectors supported by the department. This growth reflects both the increasing global confidence in Hong Kong's innovation ecosystem and the city's strategic role as a springboard for I&T businesses looking to access Mainland China and Asia-Pacific markets.

 The BIO International Convention 2025 unites over 20 000 global industry leaders, representing virtually the entire biotechnology ecosystem. In an era of transformative discovery, biotechnology is revolutionising healthcare, agriculture, and environmental sustainability, offering hope and solutions to global challenges."

HK's drinking water testing programme conducted in strict compliance with international standards,2025-06-15 00:14,2025-06-15 00:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/15/P2025061500009.htm,"  In response to a media report about impurities found in drinking water samples from various districts, a spokesman for the Development Bureau pointed out that the tests mentioned in the report were not conducted in strict compliance with the international standards adopted by Hong Kong's drinking water testing programme.

The spokesman said that, as understood, the media organisation had mainly collected samples of impurities from aerators of water taps (commonly known as strainers), and then placed the samples into water for laboratory testing. Aerators are a kind of filter accessory commonly installed at household water taps and shower heads to help block impurities. The presence of impurities in the samples is simply a result of the function of the strainer, and is not abnormal. In the past, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) had received similar inquiries, and staff members were deployed immediately to conduct onsite inspection, arrange flushing of consumers' water meter, remind consumers to cleanse the strainers, and check if there were any irregularities in water quality. If there was a suspected water quality issue, the WSD would collect drinking water samples for testing and notify consumers about the results. In fact, only a few of such cases required water sample testing in the past three years, and testing results showed that the water samples complied with Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards (HKDWS).

The spokesman stressed that water quality testing must be conducted in accordance with international standards, including making reference to ISO5667 of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for sampling and referencing Chinese National Standard GB/T 5750 and American Public Health Association's (APHA) in testing methods and procedures. The samples tested must be drinking water samples, not those collected from strainers as arranged by the relevant media organisation. In other words, the type of samples, methods and procedures will affect the validity and representativeness of the tests.

The spokesman said that, as mentioned in the report, impurities collected from the strainers include resin, plastic, and silicone. It may relate to materials peeling off from pipes or fittings of the inside service of the building. These substances are not soluble in water. If such substances are found, the inside service should be cleansed as soon as possible. Generally, regular and proper cleansing and maintenance of the inside service of the building can effectively prevent excessive sediments accumulation and reduce impurities in strainers. Drinking water supplied by the WSD undergoes strict treatment and meets HKDWS. However, materials may peel off from public or inside service pipes of buildings due to aging or water pressure, necessitating the installation of strainers at pipes. Property owners, registered agents, and management offices must carry out regular and proper maintenance of building's inside service, including cleansing sump and rooftop tanks to avoid sediments or rust accumulation, and regularly operating valves, cleansing filters, and flushing concealed water pipes to maintain good drinking water quality at the consumers' taps.

To ensure the quality of drinking water in Hong Kong, the WSD runs a routine drinking water testing programme, randomly collecting water samples from over 28,000 publicly accessible consumers' taps (such as those in shopping centres, community facilities, sports venues, and government offices) for testing every year. The sampling rate is based on international standards and the water quality parameters are drawn up in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Moreover, the WSD randomly selects about 670 residential and non-residential water accounts each year to collect drinking water samples at their water taps and test for six metals (antimony, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and nickel) to ensure compliance with HKDWS. Relevant test results are regularly published on the WSD's website.

The spokesman added that the WSD had requested more detailed information for follow-up with the consumer when enquiries were received from the media organisation. Such information is still awaited. The WSD will deploy staff to investigate and assist with flushing the inside service if the media organisation provides more information (including sampling locations). Water samples will also be taken for testing as needed to ensure water safety. For enquiries regarding drinking water quality, the public may call the WSD's 24-hour hotline: 2824 5000."
