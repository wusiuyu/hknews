至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由一月九日中午截至今日（一月十二日）中午，食安中心已在過去三日（包括過去的星期六及星期日）對372個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

同期，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）已對150個本地漁產品樣本作輻射水平檢測，全部樣本檢測合格。詳情可參閱漁護署網頁（www.afcd.gov.hk/tc_chi/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html）。

香港天文台亦已加強監測本港水域的環境輻射水平。至目前為止，並沒有發現異常情況。詳情可參閱香港天文台的網頁（www.hko.gov.hk/tc/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html）。

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2026-01-12 15:35,2026-01-12 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200492.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on January 9 to noon today (January 12), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 372 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website
(www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 196 280 samples of food imported from Japan (including 126 193 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 43 318 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

屋宇署於二○二三年九月開展大規模行動，巡查紅山半島臨海一帶獨立屋，在多幢獨立屋發現僭建物，包括上述涉事三幢獨立屋。屋宇署調查發現，該三幢獨立屋的業主明知未事先獲得屋宇署批准及同意便進行有關建築工程，包括在花園、天井、客廳、睡房、平台及天台等樓層加建若干搭建物，違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條。屋宇署遂於二○二四年八月及九月根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條對業主提出檢控。他們上周四被法庭定罪及分別被判處罰款130,000元、85,000元及60,000元。

屋宇署發言人今日（一月十二日）說:「屋宇署先後向紅山半島30幢獨立屋提出檢控，目前累計因僭建違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條而被法庭定罪的個案已有24宗，法院正陸續就餘下個案展開聆訊。」

發言人表示，業主在物業進行建築工程之前，應先諮詢建築專業人士的意見，確保建築工程符合《建築物條例》的規定。

根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條的規定，任何人明知而違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條（即在未事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，展開或進行任何建築工程），即屬犯罪，一經定罪，最高可處罰款400,000元及監禁兩年；及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款最高20,000元。

政府今年會向立法會提交草案，修訂《建築物條例》，當中會增加嚴重僭建物罪行的罰則以加強阻嚇力。"
"Owners of three detached houses of Redhill Peninsula fined over $270,000 in total for carrying out unauthorised building works",2026-01-12 15:00,2026-01-12 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200373.htm,"Owners of three detached houses of Redhill Peninsula pleaded guilty at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts last Thursday (January 8) to carrying out unauthorised building works (UBWs) in contravention of section 14(1) of the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123) , namely, knowingly undertaking building works without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD). They were fined $275,000 in total by the court.

The BD conducted a large-scale operation in September 2023 to inspect houses along the coastal area of Redhill Peninsula. UBWs were found in a number of detached houses, including the aforementioned three houses. The investigation by the BD found that the owners of the three houses had knowingly carried out the UBWs without the prior approval and consent from the BD, including adding structures to the garden, open yard, living room, bedroom, flat roof and the rooftop, thus contravening section 14(1) of the BO. Hence, the BD instigated prosecution action against the owners under section 40(1AA) of the BO in August and September 2024. They were convicted and fined $130,000, $85,000 and $60,000 respectively last Thursday.

""The BD has already instigated prosecution actions against 30 detached houses on Redhill Peninsula. So far, 24 cases have been convicted by the courts for contravening section 14(1) of the BO. Court hearings for the remaining cases are being rolled out,"" a BD spokesman said today (January 12).

The spokesman said that property owners should consult building professionals before carrying out building works to ensure compliance with the BO.

Pursuant to section 40(1AA) of the BO, any person who knowingly contravenes section 14(1) (i.e. commencement or carrying out any building works without having first obtained approval and consent from the BD) commits an offence and is liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $400,000 and imprisonment for two years, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues.

The Government will submit a bill to the Legislative Council to amend the BO this year, which will include increasing penalties for offences against serious UBWs to enhance deterrence."

EDB reminds parents to choose primary schools under Central Allocation process for their children,2026-01-12 11:30,2026-01-12 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/12/P2026011200179.htm,"The Education Bureau (EDB) today (January 12) reminded parents that children who have joined the Primary One Admission (POA) System for 2026 but have not yet secured a discretionary place can take part in the Central Allocation process for a Primary One (P1) place in a government or aided primary school. Parents concerned should make their choice of schools within the period from January 19 to 25.

Digitalisation of POA
---------------------------

In line with the Smart Government strategy, the EDB has fully implemented digitalisation of the POA. Parents who have registered as POA e-Platform (ePOA) users and have bound their account to ""iAM Smart+"" may submit the Choice of Schools Form for Central Allocation from January 19 to 25 through the ePOA. Please refer to the related videos and Parent's Guide on the EDB's website (www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/primary-secondary/spa-systems/primary-1-admission/poa_eplatform/index.html) for details of the procedures for activating and logging into an ePOA account and for making school choices for the Central Allocation of POA via the e-Platform.

Making school choices at Central Allocation Centres
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The EDB will send letters to parents on January 14 inviting them to make their choice of schools. To cater for the needs of different parents, parents can still submit the Choice of Schools Form in paper form by visiting the designated Central Allocation Centre at the suggested time slot (i.e. 9.30am to 12.30pm or 1.30pm to 4.30pm on January 24 (Saturday) or 9.30am to 12.30pm on January 25 (Sunday)) stated in the letter.

Parents who are ePOA users may choose to submit the Central Allocation Application via the ePOA or in paper form to the Central Allocation Centre but should not submit duplicate applications. Parents who have not yet received the letter by January 19 should call the School Places Allocation Section of the EDB (Hotline: 2832 7700) as soon as possible.

Only one parent of an applicant child is required to complete the school choice-making procedures. Parents are advised not to take their children to the Central Allocation Centre if possible. Parents who cannot make school choices within the suggested time slot can go to the designated Central Allocation Centre from 1.30pm to 4.30pm on January 25. The Choice of Schools Form will be sent together with the letter to parents who have submitted a paper Application Form at the Discretionary Places stage for filling out in advance.

In the event of adverse weather or other special conditions on any day during the period of making school choices, please pay heed to radio or television announcements on the relevant special arrangements.

Unable to submit application within specified choice-making period
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For individual parents who are unable to use the ePOA or go to the Central Allocation Centre to make school choices, they can authorise in writing a representative to bring the completed Choice of Schools Form and their signed Letter of Authorisation to the Central Allocation Centre to proceed with the related procedures.

To apply for POA 2026 for their children after January 25, parents need to complete necessary procedures with the School Places Allocation Section, which will separately arrange P1 places for the applicant children in June.

Change of residential address
--------------------------------------

An EDB spokesman reminded parents that, if they have recently moved their residence or have such plans in the near future, they are required to inform the School Places Allocation Section as soon as possible so that they can make school choices in the POA School Net where their new home is located. Parents should fill in the actual residential address of their child. If they provide a false address for securing a P1 place, the POA application of their child will be rendered void and the P1 place allocated will be withdrawn.

The EDB has put in place a monitoring mechanism to verify the residential addresses of applicant children as given by the parents. Random checks have also been stepped up. The public may call the School Places Allocation Section to report suspected cases of using a false address by parents for their children's POA application. The EDB will take action against false address cases.

Mechanism of Central Allocation
----------------------------------------

Central Allocation is composed of two parts. Part A, which takes up 10 per cent of the P1 places earmarked for Central Allocation, is for unrestricted school choices. Parents can choose up to three government or aided primary schools in any school net. Part B takes up the remaining 90 per cent of the P1 places earmarked for Central Allocation. Parents of applicant children residing in the school net concerned are to select schools from the ""Choice of Schools List for Central Allocation (Primary One Admission 2026)"" of their school net, while parents of applicant children who intend to commute daily to schools in Hong Kong are to select schools from the ""2026 Choice of Schools List for Central Allocation (For Applicant Children who intend to commute daily to schools in Hong Kong)"". Parents should fill in the Choice of Schools Form in the order of their preference.

The mechanism of the Central Allocation is based on parents' choices in general. The computer-programmed allocation will first process the school choices in Part A and then the school choices in Part B. For oversubscribed schools, the order of priority in allocating places will be determined by random numbers generated by the computer for individual applicants to ensure fairness.

For information about the procedures for Central Allocation, please call the EDB's 24-hour automatic telephone enquiry service at 2891 0088.

Release of Central Allocation results
----------------------------------------------

For parents who have already activated their ePOA account via ""iAM Smart"" or ""iAM Smart+"", they will receive their Central Allocation results through the ePOA from 10am on June 3. Parents who wish to receive the allocation results via SMS on June 3 may choose such an option in the Choice of Schools Form. In addition, the allocation results will be sent to parents by post on June 3 and 4."

小一入學申請電子化
—————————

為配合「智慧政府」策略，教育局已將小一入學申請全面電子化。如家長已登記成為「小一入學電子平台」用戶並以「智方便+」綁定帳戶，可透過電子平台於一月十九日至二十五日遞交統一派位「選擇學校表格」。教育局網頁（www.edb.gov.hk/tc/edu-system/primary-secondary/spa-systems/primary-1-admission/POA_ePlatform/index.html）載有短片及家長指南，介紹啓動「小一入學電子平台」帳戶、登入帳戶及經電子平台辦理小一入學統一派位階段選校手續的詳情。

到統一派位中心辦理選校手續
—————————————

教育局將於一月十四日向各家長寄出選校通知書。為照顧不同家長的需要，家長仍可以紙本形式遞交「選擇學校表格」。他們可按通知書上的建議時段（即一月二十四日（星期六）上午九時三十分至下午十二時三十分或下午一時三十分至四時三十分，或一月二十五日（星期日）上午九時三十分至下午十二時三十分）前往指定統一派位中心辦理。

已成為「小一入學電子平台」用戶的家長可自行決定以電子平台或到統一派位中心遞交統一派位申請，但請勿遞交重複申請。倘若家長於一月十九日仍未接獲通知書，須盡快致電教育局學位分配組（熱線電話：2832 7700）查詢。

選校手續只須申請兒童的其中一位家長辦理，家長應盡量避免帶同子女前往統一派位中心。如家長未能於建議時段辦理選校手續，可於一月二十五日下午一時三十分至四時三十分到指定統一派位中心辦理。選校通知書會夾附「選擇學校表格」供曾以紙本表格遞交自行分配學位申請的家長預先填寫。

如在辦理選校手續當日，本港遇上惡劣天氣或其他特殊情況，請留意電台及電視台公布有關的特別安排。

未能於指定選校期間遞交申請
—————————————

如個別家長未能使用「小一入學電子平台」或前往統一派位中心辦理選校手續，可授權一名人士帶同已填妥的「選擇學校表格」及家長簽署的「代辦選校手續」授權書前往統一派位中心，以代辦有關手續。

若家長於一月二十五日後才為子女提出申請參加二○二六年度小一入學統籌辦法，他們須前往學位分配組辦理有關手續，學位分配組會於六月為申請兒童另行安排小一學位。

更改住址
————

教育局發言人提醒家長，如最近曾遷居或快將搬遷，必須盡快通知學位分配組，以便按新住址填選所屬小一學校網內的學校。家長必須填報子女的真確住址，倘若提供虛假住址以獲取學位，其子女的小一入學申請將會作廢，獲派的學位亦會被取消。

教育局設有查核機制，確認申請兒童是否屬於所填報的學校網，並已加強有關抽查工作。市民如懷疑有家長虛報住址以替其子女申請小一入學，可致電學位分配組舉報。教育局定必對虛報住址的個案採取行動。

統一派位機制
——————

統一派位分為甲、乙兩部分。甲部佔統一派位學額的10%，為不受學校網限制的學校選擇，家長可選擇不超過三所位於任何學校網的官立或資助小學。乙部佔統一派位學額餘下的90%，居於有關學校網的申請兒童的家長，須選擇載列於其所屬學校網的《2026年度小一入學統一派位選校名單》內的小學；計劃跨境到港上學的申請兒童的家長則須選擇載列於《2026年度統一派位選校名單（計劃跨境到港上學的申請兒童）》內的小學。在填寫「選擇學校表格」時，家長應依照意願排列所選小學的先後次序。

統一派位機制基本上是以家長的選擇為依歸。派位電腦程序首先會處理甲部的學校選擇，然後處理乙部的學校選擇。若個別學校的申請人數多於其小一學額，電腦會按申請兒童的「隨機編號」決定分配學位的優先次序，務求公允。

教育局設有24小時自動電話查詢服務（電話：2891 0088），供家長聽取有關統一派位程序的資料。

統一派位結果公布
————————

Dr Wong (Chairman of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Council, Dr Peter Wong), Professor Zhang (President and Vice-Chancellor of the HKU, Professor Zhang Xiang), Mr Turner (Executive Director of Foundation Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, Mr Nikolaus Turner), distinguished Nobel Laureates, esteemed scientists,ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you today for the Nobel Heroes Forum: Shaping Science and Future.

  To our Nobel Laureates – we are truly privileged to have you with us. You represent the very best of human curiosity and perseverance. Your ground-breaking work expands our understanding of the universe, lights the path for future discovery, and inspires generations. Thank you for joining this extraordinary gathering.

  And to all our distinguished guests from around the world – a very warm welcome to Hong Kong.

  Today's dialogue is more than an academic event. It is a powerful convergence of the world's finest scientific minds, right here in a city that is determined to play its part in global innovation.

  Hong Kong's mission is clear and unwavering: to become a premier international innovation and technology centre. A hub where top scientists, scholars and entrepreneurs can thrive, collaborate and serve the world.

  To achieve this, the Government is fully committed. We are building a world-class ecosystem and nurturing the talent to power it.

  First, we are building the infrastructure for greatness.

  We have established a strategic I&T framework centred on three major I&T (innovation and technology) parks and five key research and development institutions.

  Building on the success of the Science Park and Cyberport, we officially launched the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone last month.

  The Hetao Co-operation Zone is a major co-operation platform in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area under the National 14th Five-Year Plan. The Hong Kong Park is envisioned as a world-class hub for technological innovation, connecting the Chinese Mainland with the international community, and serving as an important source for fostering new quality productive forces.

  Together with our five key R&D (research and development) institutions focus on frontier technologies, these developments will create more favourable conditions for Hong Kong to attract global I&T resources and talent.

  Second, we are investing decisively.

  We back our words with resources. We have launched significant funding schemes across the entire innovation chain.

  To support excellent and impactful research, the Research Grants Council (RGC) under the University Grants Committee administers more than 20 competitive research grant and fellowship schemes.

  Furthermore, last year we launched the 3 billion HK dollars Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme to empower ground-breaking basic research led by world-class researchers and academics.

  To accelerate the midstream and downstream development, we rolled out three separate 10 billion HK dollars initiatives to drive the commercialisation of R&D outcomes and new industrialisation.

  Third, and most crucially, we are nurturing and attracting top talent.

  Talent is our ultimate driving force. We are expanding our talent pool through multiple strategies.

  On nurturing young research talent, the Government has launched the Young Collaborative Research Grant to support early-stage researchers in leading and managing collaborative research. We are also actively fostering research collaboration between Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and overseas research funding agencies through operating various Joint Research Schemes. These partnerships not only foster academic exchange but also provide opportunities to nurture researchers in exploring new frontiers in their respective fields.

  On attracting global talent, the RGC Junior Research Fellow Scheme has supported some 300 doctoral graduates from Hong Kong and around the world to pursue research careers at our universities.

  Our international research flagship, the InnoHK research clusters, is also there to bring together brilliant minds from all over the world to conduct world-class scientific research. To date, our two existing InnoHK research clusters – one focusing on healthcare technology and another on AI and robotics – have successfully built links with over 30 world-class universities and research institutes from 12 economies, pooling together around 3 000 researchers locally and across the globe.

  To go further, the Government is now expediting the development of the third InnoHK research cluster, with the focus on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing and materials.

  Our strategy follows a powerful cycle: promoting technology with talent, leading industries with technology, and attracting talent with industries.

  And we are seeing results. Hong Kong ranks third globally in ""Technology"" in the World Digital Competitiveness Ranking. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster ranks first in the 2025 Global Innovation Index Ranking of the World's Top 100 innovation clusters.

  Our startup community has grown nearly fivefold in the past decade, producing homegrown unicorns.

  This progress is no accident. It is built on Hong Kong's unique strengths. Under ""one country, two systems"", we enjoy unwavering national support and unparalleled global connectivity. Our robust rule of law, free-flowing capital and vibrant multicultural society make Hong Kong the perfect incubator for scientific exploration and technological breakthroughs.

  To every scientist, researcher and innovator here today: Hong Kong is open for you. We provide the platform, the funding, the freedom and the connections to turn visionary ideas into reality.

  We invite you to build your legacy here. To join us in shaping not just the future of Hong Kong, but the future of science for humanity.

  On this note, let the dialogue begin. I look forward to the fruitful and inspirational exchanges. Thank you."

  The scope of service of the FTA Scheme originally covered cargoes of 71 economies under 23 trade agreements signed between the Mainland and its trading partners to be transshipped via Hong Kong to the Mainland. Also covered were Mainland transshipment cargoes heading for Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Myanmar and Australia via Hong Kong under eights trade agreements signed.

  Upon the extension, local traders starting from today can apply to Hong Kong Customs for a Certificate of Non-manipulation for the purpose of claiming a preferential tariff under the China-Peru Free Trade Agreement for cargoes from the Mainland transshipped to Peru via Hong Kong.

  Hong Kong Customs will make persistent efforts to extend the coverage of the FTA Scheme to enable more goods passing through Hong Kong to enjoy tariff concessions provided under relevant trade agreements, assist enterprises to tap into new markets, reinforcing Hong Kong's status as a leading logistics hub.
  ​
  Hong Kong Customs implemented the FTA Scheme on December 20, 2015, to provide traders with Customs supervision services and issue the Certificate of Non-manipulation to certify transshipment cargoes that have not undergone any further processing during their stay in Hong Kong.

The programme, which will last for two years, with a total of 427 places, aims to train students to become enrolled nurses to alleviate the shortage of nurses in the welfare sector and enhance the quality of care services.

In response to the keen demand for nurses in the welfare sector, the SWD has commissioned the Hong Kong Metropolitan University, Saint Francis University and the Tung Wah College to provide the Enrolled Nurse (General) Training Programme for the Welfare Sector for five consecutive years starting from the 2023-24 academic year.

An SWD spokesman said, ""Applicants for the programme must be permanent Hong Kong residents with right of abode in Hong Kong and have attained the age of 18 by the time the training programme commences. They must also have attained Level2 or above in five subjects, including Chinese Language, English Language, Mathematics and any two other subjects in Categories A (Note) and B, in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination; or an equivalent qualification. Applicants are also required to take note of other entry requirements as specified by respective training institutes.""

The spokesman added, ""To encourage young people and frontline staff currently serving the welfare sector to upgrade their professional skills, priority will be accorded to applicants who have successfully completed the two-year Diploma Programme and obtained the diploma under the Navigation Scheme for Young Persons in Care Services launched in 2015 (or under the First-hire-then-train Pilot Scheme from 2013 to 2016) by the SWD; or those who are currently working full-time in non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or private organisations providing elderly, rehabilitation, family and child care, youth or correctional services. Individuals who aspire to pursue a career as enrolled nurses in the welfare sector are also welcome.""

Tuition fees will be reimbursed to trainees in full on the condition that they have successfully completed the training programme and qualified to register as enrolled nurses within two years. Trainees will be required to sign an undertaking to work as an Enrolled Nurse (General) in NGOs or private organisations recognised by the SWD for providing elderly, rehabilitation, family and child care, or correctional services for a continuous period of no less than three years after completion of the training.

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-11 17:30,2026-01-11 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/11/P2026011100532.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
​
市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-11 17:30,2026-01-11 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/11/P2026011100533.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 11), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
------------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
