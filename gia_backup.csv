Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-21 17:30,2026-02-21 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/21/P2026022100372.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 21), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-21 17:30,2026-02-21 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/21/P2026022100371.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月二十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Reporter: Could you also tell us in English what is the impact on Hong Kong after Donald Trump signed the 10 per cent global tariff on top of the existing tax?

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: If you look at what Hong Kong as it is, one of our advantages is the certainty in terms of how we regulate the market and the overall stability of our overall environment. And this fiasco, I think basically highlights the importance of Hong Kong in this area. We'll continue to see Hong Kong as a very strong and also very safe haven for global investors and global corporates to invest and to station here.

記者：特朗普剛簽署對各國商品加徵10%關稅，對香港會否有影響？

第二方面當然是我們本身的經濟其實有一定的底氣，包括服務業佔我們整個GDP（本地生產總值）的組成有相當部分。因此，一直以來，即使是關稅有不同情況，其實對我們經濟韌性的影響是相對有限。持續下去，我們只要繼續努力，我相信香港整體環境只會更好。

Accident and Emergency Departments of public hospitals operate smoothly during Lunar New Year holidays,2026-02-20 19:10,2026-02-20 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000561.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (February 20) that over the past three days of the Lunar New Year holidays, the number of patients attending the 18 Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) under the HA decreased by over 10 per cent compared to the same period last year. This indicates that the public healthcare fees and charges reform has achieved its desired effect, alleviating service pressure on A&Es and enabling them to concentrate resources on patients with urgent medical needs.

The Chairman of the HA Coordinating Committee in A&E, Dr Axel Siu, said, ""During the past three-day public holiday, the number of patients attending A&Es decreased by approximately 11 per cent to 15 per cent compared to the same period last year (see Table). A&Es operations across all hospitals remained normal, allowing patients with urgent medical needs to receive prompt treatment. Less urgent patients also experienced shorter waiting times. This demonstrates that the various measures introduced under the public healthcare fees and charges reform are proving effective, enabling A&Es to perform their emergency care function.""

Dr Siu further explained that in the small hours of today, some A&Es needed to deploy healthcare staff to resuscitate patient cases, coupled with the usual increase in A&E attendances following the extended holidays, which led to longer waiting times for some less urgent patients this morning. Dr Siu emphasised that, despite the increased workload in A&Es, services for critical, emergency and urgent patients were not affected. Additional staff have been deployed to enhance service, ensuring all patients received appropriate treatment. By the afternoon, waiting times for less urgent patients had progressively decreased, with most receiving suitable care within a few hours.

The HA anticipates that public hospital A&E services will remain busy in the coming days after the Lunar New Year holidays. Non-urgent patients are advised to avoid using A&E services and to seek consultation at Family Medicine Clinics, private doctors, or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es.

From January 1 to February 10 this year, a total of 199 406 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA, reflecting a significant decrease of nearly 10.9 per cent compared to the same period last year. Among these, 98 988 patients were classified as semi-urgent and non-urgent, a reduction of about 18.6 per cent from the previous year.

During this period, waiting times for all critical and emergency patients fully met the pledge targets, with critical patients receiving immediate treatment and emergency patients being treated within 15 minutes. For patients triaged as urgent cases, the percentage of those being treated within 30 minutes - meeting the service pledge target - increased from 80.1 per cent last year to 86.9 per cent, with the average waiting time reduced from 24 minutes to 20 minutes. The average waiting times for semi-urgent and non-urgent patients also decreased from 136 minutes to 124 minutes.

公立醫院急症室於農曆新年假期運作暢順,2026-02-20 19:10,2026-02-20 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000558.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（二月二十日）表示，過去三日農曆新年公眾假期，醫管局轄下18間急症室的求診人數較去年農曆新年三日假期的求診人數下跌超過一成，顯示公營醫療收費改革已取得預期效果，紓緩急症室的服務壓力，令急症室可集中資源全力照顧有緊急醫療需要的病人。

醫管局急症科統籌委員會主席蕭粵中醫生說︰「過去三日公眾假期，前往急症室求診的病人數目較去年農曆新年同期大約減少11%至15%（見附表）。各醫院急症室運作正常，有緊急醫療需要的病人均可以迅速獲得治療，至於非緊急病人，亦不需要等候太長時間，顯示公營醫療收費改革的各項措施正發揮效用，急症室可真正發揮救急扶危的功能。」

蕭粵中醫生表示，由於今日凌晨時分，部分醫院急症室需調動醫護人員處理搶救個案，加上一般在長假期結束後，都會有較多病人到急症室求診，導致今日早上部分急症室的非緊急病人需要等候較長時間。蕭粵中醫生強調，雖然急症室比較繁忙，但所有危殆、危急及緊急病人的服務均沒有受影響；急症室已調動額外人手加強服務，確保所有病人均獲得合適的治療。到下午時段，急症室的非緊急病人等候時間已陸續回落，大部分病人在等候數小時內已獲得合適的治療。

醫管局預計，隨著農曆新年長假期結束，未來幾日各公立醫院急症室的服務會繼續繁忙，非緊急的病人應避免使用急症室，盡量向家庭醫學門診、私家醫生及私家醫院24小時門診求診，以減輕公立醫院急症室的壓力。

由今年一月一日至二月十日，共有199 406名病人前往醫管局轄下18間急症室就診，較去年同期顯著減少近10.9%。當中98 988名病人分流為次緊急及非緊急，較去年同期減少約18.6%。

在上述期間，危殆及危急病人的救治時間全部達標，即危殆病人獲即時診治，危急病人於15分鐘內獲診治。緊急病人於30分鐘內就診的服務承諾達標比率，由80.1%增加至86.9%，平均等候時間亦由24分鐘縮短至20分鐘。次緊急及非緊急病人的平均等候時間亦由136分鐘減少至124分鐘。

The preparatorygroup will commence preparatory work for the upcoming release of the National 15th Five-Year Plan, making more comprehensive, precise and detailed strategic arrangements for the 15th Five-Year Plan and proactively leveraging the role of Hong Kong's legal and dispute resolution services in national development.

  The preparatorygroup is chaired by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and vice-chaired by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan. Members include the Law Officer (Civil Law), the Solicitor General, the Law Officer (International Law), and the Director of Administration and Development of the DoJ. The secretaries of the Group are the Principal Government Counsel of the Legal Enhancement and Development Office and the Director of the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Office.

  Thepreparatory group convened its first meeting today to discuss the DoJ's key areas of development, staffing and resource allocation under the 15th Five-Year Plan. Once the contents and details of the 15th Five-Year Plan are released, the preparatory group will be converted into a working group to advance various tasks of proactively aligning with the 15th Five-Year Plan. As directed by the Chief Executive, Hong Kong's five-year blueprint in aligning with the country's 15th Five-Year Plan will be completed within this year, furtherpromoting Hong Kong's better integration into and contribution to the overall national development.

  Mr Lam said that as the inaugural year of the 15th Five-Year Plan begins, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted the Recommendations for Formulating the 15th Five-Year Plan, which set out Hong Kong's strategic position as the ""three centres and a hub"", to consolidate and enhance the city's status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre, and to support Hong Kong in building itself into an international hub for high-calibre talent. In promoting the development of the rule of law, the recommendations include accelerating the development of a foreign-related legal system and capabilities, and improving mediation, arbitration, and litigation mechanisms for international commercial disputes. In the 15th Five-Year Plan, Hong Kong can strive to play its role by showcasing its strengths in internationalised, high-standard, and highly credible legal and dispute resolution services, and by actively contributing to the training of international legal talent. By proactively aligning with the 15th Five-Year Plan, Hong Kong will further contribute to the country's efforts in promoting the foreign-related rule of law and in building a higher-level of rule of law in China."
