衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案,2025-08-10 17:30,2025-08-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/10/P2025081000452.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月十日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得五宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

鑑於香港出現多宗輸入個案，存在經蚊子引致二代本地傳播的風險。衞生防護中心昨日已發信提醒醫生，為臨床症狀符合基孔肯雅熱的患者安排檢測，不論其旅遊史。根據臨床判斷，亦應考慮為有任何基孔肯雅熱症狀並有到訪受影響地區旅遊史的患者進行檢測。中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測，以確保及早診斷。

衞生署已加強對不同群組有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作。中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並向旅客派發宣傳單張。港口衞生科人員近日亦已提醒港鐵公司、跨境巴士和客輪公司營辦商及機場管理局等加強防控蚊患措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。長者健康外展分隊已透過超過300個為長者及照顧者提供的健康推廣活動推廣預防基孔肯雅熱的資訊。此外，長者健康服務亦安排在十八區的長者健康中心派發相關的單張，讓長者了解其症狀及加強防患基孔肯雅熱的意識。家庭健康服務亦在轄下的母嬰健康院提醒孕婦及嬰幼兒照顧者有關預防基孔肯雅熱的注意事項。學生健康服務會在轄下的學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心向學生派發宣傳單張，讓他們了解基孔肯雅熱的症狀。

健康促進處致力透過不同途徑向市民宣傳預防蚊子傳播的疾病（包括基孔肯雅熱）的健康信息，包括於全港各區設置資訊站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/other/events/476.html），透過不同的線上及線下渠道發放有關健康資訊，並適時根據最新情況更新內容。為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。健康促進處亦聯絡與少數族裔相關的持份者（如提供服務的非政府機構及宗教團體等），向他們派發相關健康資料，讓更多市民獲得防蚊的資訊，共同預防基孔肯雅熱的傳播。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today,2025-08-10 17:30,2025-08-10 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/10/P2025081000453.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 10) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the CF cases in recent days. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of five CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases, and one probable case has been recorded. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

In view of the occurrence of multiple imported cases in Hong Kong, the risk of secondary local transmission via mosquitoes exists. The CHP has issued a letter yesterday to remind doctors to arrange testing for patients with clinically compatible presentations of CF regardless of travel history. Testing should also be considered for patients with any symptoms of CF and a travel history to affected areas, based on clinical judgment. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch has been providing free testing to ensure rapid diagnosis.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers. The Port Health Division staff has recently reminded MTR Corporation, cross-boundary coach and ferry companies operators, and the Airport Authority to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and reminding residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service has promoted information of CF prevention at more than 300 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The Health Promotion Branch is committed to disseminating health information on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases (including CF) to the public through multiple channels. Measures include setting up Info Stations across various districts in Hong Kong (www.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html) and distributing relevant health messages through different online and offline platforms, with content updated as appropriate in light of the latest development. To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into ten ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite. The Health Promotion Branch has also contacted stakeholders serving ethnic minority groups (such as non-governmental organisations and religious groups) to distribute relevant health materials, so that more members of the public can access anti-mosquito information and work together to prevent the spread of CF.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The CHP recommends that the public properly use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients to effectively prevent mosquito bites. The following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535, picaridin etc. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and alsoMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

大家好。很開心今日下午在啟德青年運動場跟大家一起出席第一屆「樂動新城‧慈善運音會」，與大家一同參與這個充滿動感的盛會。

運動強健體魄，音樂滋養心靈。上星期是全民運動日，我們說，日日運動一分鐘，健康快樂人輕鬆。體育和運動對於學業和工作繁忙的香港人而言，無疑是保持身心健康的最好方法。今日，新城廣播有限公司舉辦的「樂動新城‧慈善運音會」，有緊張刺激的體育競賽，又有賞心悅耳的音樂表演，相信這場體藝共融、動靜交織的精彩體驗，一定會感染在場每一位觀眾「動起來」，共同推動全民運動的風潮。

今日的運音會星光熠熠，剛才大家都看到有Aaron、校長，此外還有很多巨星、實力唱將、耀眼新星，以及本地體壇精英和傳奇名宿，大家一同齊心為慈善出力，現場氣氛，大家都告訴我，除了天氣熱之外，你們也一樣熾熱！希望大家都能夠全力以赴，Show Your Best，為觀眾帶來精彩紛呈的比賽和表演，讓我們可以大飽眼福和耳福。

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-10 06:48,2025-08-10 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/10/P2025081000185.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 10) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Customs officers intercepted an incoming female passenger, aged 58, at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on August 8. A total of 981 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $4,000 and a duty potential of about $3,000 were seized. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today (with photos),2025-08-09 18:30,2025-08-09 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900586.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 9) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the CF cases in recent days. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of five CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases, and one probable case has been recorded. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

In view of the occurrence of multiple imported cases in Hong Kong, the risk of secondary local transmission via mosquitoes exists. The CHP will issue a letter again to remind doctors to arrange testing for patients with clinically compatible presentations of CF regardless of travel history. Testing should also be considered for patients with any symptoms of CF and a travel history to affected areas, based on clinical judgment. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing to ensure rapid diagnosis.

The DH has enhanced publicity and education efforts regarding CF targeting different groups. The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures, and also distributes leaflets to travellers. The Port Health Division staff has recently reminded MTR Corporation, cross-boundary coach and ferry companies operators, and the Airport Authority to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division also conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers. Any travellers with fever or related symptoms will be assessed for their health condition and referred to hospitals for follow-up when necessary.

To raise the awareness of the elderly on preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at the health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres, and reminding residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service has promoted information of CF prevention at more than 300 health promotion activities provided to the elderly and their carers. In addition, the Elderly Health Service has arranged for the distribution of relevant leaflets at Elderly Health Centres across the 18 districts, with a view to helping the elderly to learn about the symptoms of CF and enhance their awareness of prevention of CF. The Family Health Service has also advised pregnant women and infant carers at its Maternal and Child Health Centres about precautions for preventing CF. The Student Health Service will distribute promotional leaflets to students at its Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres so that students could learn more about symptoms of CF.

The Health Promotion Branch is committed to disseminating health information on the prevention of mosquito-borne diseases (including CF) to the public through multiple channels. Measures include setting up Info Stations across various districts in Hong Kong (www.chp.gov.hk/en/other/events/476.html) and distributing relevant health messages through different online and offline platforms, with content updated as appropriate in light of the latest development. To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into ten ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHP website. The Health Promotion Branch has also contacted stakeholders serving ethnic minority groups (such as non-governmental organisations and religious groups) to distribute relevant health materials, so that more members of the public can access anti-mosquito information and work together to prevent the spread of CF.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The CHP recommends that the public properly use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients to effectively prevent mosquito bites. The following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."
衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案（附圖）,2025-08-09 18:30,2025-08-09 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/09/P2025080900582.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月九日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得五宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

鑑於香港出現多宗輸入個案，存在經蚊子引致二代本地傳播的風險。衞生防護中心今日將再發信提醒醫生，為臨床症狀符合基孔肯雅熱的患者安排檢測，不論其旅遊史。根據臨床判斷，亦應考慮為有任何基孔肯雅熱症狀並有到訪受影響地區旅遊史的患者進行檢測。中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測，以確保及早診斷。

衞生署已加強對不同群組有關基孔肯雅熱的宣傳教育工作。中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施，並向旅客派發宣傳單張。港口衞生科人員近日亦已提醒港鐵公司、跨境巴士和客輪公司營辦商及機場管理局等加強防控蚊患措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會為抵港人士進行體溫篩查，為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，並在有需要時轉介他們到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。長者健康外展分隊已透過超過300個為長者及照顧者提供的健康推廣活動推廣預防基孔肯雅熱的資訊。此外，長者健康服務亦安排在十八區的長者健康中心派發相關的單張，讓長者了解其症狀及加強防患基孔肯雅熱的意識。家庭健康服務亦在轄下的母嬰健康院提醒孕婦及嬰幼兒照顧者有關預防基孔肯雅熱的注意事項。學生健康服務會在轄下的學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心向學生派發宣傳單張，讓他們了解基孔肯雅熱的症狀。

健康促進處致力透過不同途徑向市民宣傳預防蚊子傳播的疾病（包括基孔肯雅熱）的健康信息，包括於全港各區設置資訊站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/other/events/476.html），透過不同的線上及線下渠道發放有關健康資訊，並適時根據最新情況更新內容。為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。健康促進處亦聯絡與少數族裔相關的持份者（如提供服務的非政府機構及宗教團體等），向他們派發相關健康資料，讓更多市民獲得防蚊的資訊，共同預防基孔肯雅熱的傳播。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

中心建議市民使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
