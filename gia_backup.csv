政務司副司長出席2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-21 16:53,2025-10-21 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100500.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（十月二十一日）出席2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮的致辭：

衣學東主任（國務院國有資產監督管理委員會研究中心主任）、張政偉主任（國際可持續準則理事會主席特別顧問兼北京辦公室主任）、李萌副處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部金融處副處長）、鄭勇男副董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團副董事長、總經理）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家好！很高興參加由香港大公文匯傳媒集團舉辦的2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮。

行政長官的二○二五年《施政報告》推出了數項有利於推動環境、社會及企業管治（ESG）發展的舉措，包括：推動新能源產業發展，加速綠色技術落地，例如建設可持續航空燃料產業鏈和落實《香港氫能發展策略》；以及推動綠色創科成果商品化，例如支持市場發展換電型電動車及自動化換電站技術，和推動市場加快為現有建築物減碳等。

今天活動的主題名為「綠色金融匯聚，價值共創新生」，展示了推動ESG發展和綠色金融的密切關係。接下來，我想與大家分享香港在綠色和可持續金融方面的最新發展。

作為國際金融中心，香港正朝着國際綠色金融中心的方向邁進。香港擁有既深且廣的資本市場，能為不同發展階段的企業提供多元化的投融資渠道，同時把國際資金引導至優質的可持續發展項目。截至今年六月，獲證券及期貨事務監察委員會認可的ESG基金超過200隻，資產管理規模超過1.1萬億港元，分別較三年前增加51%及18%。在債券市場方面，去年在香港安排發行的綠色和可持續債券總額約3,354億港元，佔地區總額約四成半，並自二○一八年起連續七年居於亞洲區市場的首位。此外，在政府可持續債券計劃下，我們自二○一九年起已成功發行合共約2,400億港元等值的政府綠色債券，涵蓋不同類型、貨幣種類和年期，為多個本地綠色項目融資，並為潛在發行人提供重要基準。

香港是全球領先的可持續金融樞紐。特區政府全力推動符合國際標準、且一致和可比較的氣候及可持續發展的相關資訊的披露，以提升資本市場就相關資訊的透明度，便利投資者作出投資決策。去年十二月，我們推出《香港可持續披露路線圖》，就大型公眾責任實體不遲於二○二八年全面採用國際財務報告可持續披露準則（簡稱ISSB準則）提供清晰的路徑。今年六月，香港亦獲得國際財務報告準則基金會確認為首批以全面採用ISSB準則為目標的司法管轄區，顯示香港作為推動採用ISSB準則的先鋒。

為更好地結合金融科技和綠色金融，推動經濟綠色轉型，我們積極拓展綠色金融科技的生態圈，打造香港成為綠色金融科技樞紐。政府於去年六月推出全新的綠色和可持續金融科技概念驗證測試資助計劃，提供前期資助，推動進行綠色金融科技活動的科技公司或研究機構與本地企業合作，開發處理行業痛點的新項目，助力有關方案商業化和完成概念驗證。該計劃至今已批出60個綠色金融科技方案，並正陸續通過概念驗證，讓有潛力的綠色和可持續金融科技能在香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

嘉賓們、朋友們，ESG生態圈的發展有賴我們每一位的積極參與和支持。我呼籲在座各位把握今天的機會，與其他參加者交流討論，就推動香港以至全球綠色轉型及可持續未來的工作，貢獻智慧和力量。我亦祝賀今年在香港國際ESG年度榜單評選中獲獎的80間公司及機構。感謝你們為ESG建設作出的卓越貢獻，不但鼓勵更多企業走向綠色轉型，同時亦向世界展示國家在推動ESG發展和管理中的積極性和進步性。

最後，我亦想為一件關係香港未來的大事，作出呼籲。立法會的高水平、有效運作，對推動香港的經濟社會發展，至為關鍵。第八屆立法會的選舉，將在十二月七日舉行。我請大家到時踴躍參與投票，以手上一票，為「一國兩制」在香港的成功實踐行穩致遠，以及特區良政善治、長治久安和美好的未來，盡愛國愛港者的責任，貢獻力量。謝謝大家。​"
​香港海關偵破空運走私懷疑受管制瀕危物種案件（附圖）,2025-10-21 16:45,2025-10-21 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100585.htm,"香港海關十月十八日在香港國際機場偵破一宗空運走私懷疑受管制瀕危物種案件，檢獲約二百零二公斤懷疑受管制海參，估計市值約五十二萬元。

海關當日根據風檢評估於機場海關驗貨場檢查一個從沙特阿拉伯進口，報稱載有魚乾的空運貨物。經查驗後，海關人員在其中五個紙箱內檢獲該批懷疑受管制海參。一名貨物收貨人被捕。

案件仍在調查中，不排除會有更多人被捕。

海關會繼續透過風險評估和情報分析，嚴厲打擊各類型走私活動。

走私受管制瀕危物種屬嚴重罪行，根據《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》，任何人如非按照《條例》規定進出口或管有瀕危物種均屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁十年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/）舉報懷疑走私活動。"
Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case of suspected scheduled endangered species by air (with photo),2025-10-21 16:45,2025-10-21 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100587.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on October 18 detected an air freight smuggling case of suspected scheduled endangered species and seized about 202 kilograms of suspected scheduled sea cucumbers with an estimated market value of about $520,000 at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA).

Based on risk assessment, Customs on that day examined an inbound air cargo consignment from Saudi Arabia, declared as dried fish, at the Customs Cargo Examination Compound at HKIA. Upon inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected scheduled sea cucumbers in five carton boxes therein. A cargo recipient was arrested.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of more arrests is not ruled out.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement actions against all kinds of smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Smuggling of scheduled endangered species is a serious offence. Under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance, anyone importing, exporting or possessing specimens of endangered species not in accordance with the Ordinance commits an offence and will be liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years upon conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."
立法會內務委員會主席就告別議案會見傳媒的發言（只有中文）,2025-10-21 16:15,2025-10-21 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100592.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會內務委員會主席李慧琼今日（十月二十一日）於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言︰

早前的內務委員會會議上，議員同意由我以內務委員會主席身分，在明日的立法會會議上，動議告别議案。

近日，有不同議員就告别議案的安排，向我表達意見。有部分議員關注到，新一屆立法會選舉提名期於十月二十四日，即星期五開始，與最後一次立法會會議辯論時間其實是非常接近，而最新的評估是，選情是異常激烈，亦有部分議員擔心，如果在立法會會議上進行告別議案辯論，有可能對選舉造成不公平。

亦有部分議員向我表達，由於選舉提名期即將展開，希望爭取更多時間聚焦處理選舉事宜。當然亦有部分議員希望繼續辯論。

經過審慎考慮所有因素，並與核心組的成員商量，以及跟不同議員溝通後，我決定撤回動議告別議案的預告，讓議員可以更加聚焦處理議會工作，亦確保選舉的公平性。"

至於其他未有被禁止輸入香港的日本水產、海鹽和海藻，為確保食物安全，食物環境衞生署轄下食物安全中心（食安中心）正全面進行輻射水平測試；在確認相關產品沒有超出輻射水平的情況下，才放行於市場供應。

由十月二十日中午截至今日（十月二十一日）中午，食安中心已對219個日本進口「水產及其製品、海藻及海鹽」的食物樣本作輻射水平檢測，未有發現輻射水平超出安全標準。詳情可參閱食安中心「日本進口食品管制措施」專題網頁（www.cfs.gov.hk/tc_chi/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html）。

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 20 to noon today (October 21), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 219 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

創新科技及工業局局長出席騰雲香港科創集群加速器開幕典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-21 15:00,2025-10-21 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100519.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十月二十一日）在騰雲香港科創集群加速器（騰雲加速器）開幕典禮的致辭：

尊敬的黃濤先生（騰雲加速器聯合創始人、世紀金源集團總裁）、方方先生（騰雲加速器聯合創始人、香港水木投資集團合夥人）、張鈺晶會長（中國機電產品進出口商會會長）、鄭松岩總裁（香港數碼港管理有限公司行政總裁）、葛明博士（工業專員（創新及科技））、謝副局長（深圳市前海深港現代服務業合作區管理局副局長謝暉暉）、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家好！今天我非常高興與各位一同見證騰雲香港科創集群加速器落戶數碼港。

初創企業的蓬勃發展對一個地區科技創新和產業創新的發展至關重要：除了為經濟提供新動能和更多可能性之外，同時可以匯聚資源、吸引人才。在特區政府的大力推動下，香港初創企業數目去年已經達到4 700間，這些都顯示了香港的創科初創生態發展日益蓬勃。

為進一步完善本地創科生態圈，加快推動香港發展成為國際創新科技中心，行政長官在去年的《施政報告》中提出創科加速器先導計劃，目的是吸引海內外具豐富經驗的初創加速器落戶香港，建立加速器基地，進一步豐富本地專業初創服務。該計劃上月已獲得立法會財務委員會通過撥款，將為香港的初創企業提供更全面和精準的扶持，促進初創企業做大做強。

騰雲香港科創集群加速器的成立及啓用響應了特區政府扶持初創企業的政策方向。我非常感謝黃濤先生、方方先生等一批企業家、投資銀行家，以及行業專家共同發起成立騰雲加速器，攜同70多家聚焦人工智能、生物醫藥、醫療器械、能源科技等領域的優秀創科企業及投資機構來港發展，利用數碼港的優勢，為進駐的企業提供全面服務，助其在香港落地、布局、發展。加上特區政府即將推出的優化版創科創投基金及即將在明年推出全新的創科產業引導基金，將為香港創科企業的發展創造更為有利的條件。

香港是國家「引進來、走出去」的雙向通道，亦是內地企業進軍海外市場的首選出海平台。特區政府銳意發展創科，有別於以往企業需要個別建立或引進的模式，加速器的成立可以一次性地引進以支持大批初創企業並提供更精準及具系統性的支援，產生集群效應，體現香港支持初創企業發展質和量的提升。我歡迎騰雲加速器引入的多間優秀創科企業及投資機構來港發展，也期望不久的將來有更多優秀的加速器基地在港成立，共同深耕香港的創科樂土。

最後，祝賀騰雲加速器和在座各位業務蒸蒸日上！祝國家及香港的創科品牌在國際舞台上越發亮麗！謝謝大家！"

Speech by STL at IATA World Sustainability Symposium,2025-10-21 13:03,2025-10-21 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100380.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium today (October 21):

Mr Walsh (Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Mr Willie Walsh), Patrick (Chair of Cathay Group, Mr Patrick Healy), Ronald (Chief Executive Officer of Cathay Group, Mr Ronald Lam), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

A warm welcome and good morning to you all. For friends from afar, welcome to Hong Kong. It is my great honour to address this esteemed gathering this morning at the World Sustainability Symposium. I stand before you today with a deep sense of purpose, as we come together to chart a path toward a more sustainable future for the aviation industry globally and for Hong Kong.

First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to IATA and the Cathay Group for inviting me to speak at this prestigious occasion, which is one of IATA's signature events of the year. It is a fitting choice for you to host the third edition of the symposium here in Hong Kong - a city that we all love and has emerged as a leading player in sustainable aviation in the region. I have heard that this year's edition has brought together nearly 500 participants from all over the world, including senior executives, professional experts, and thought leaders in the field of green aviation. I warmly welcome all of you to Hong Kong and sincerely hope you take some time to explore and enjoy the vibrancy and warmth in Hong Kong. This hotel is well-situated, where you can have a good perspective of our harbour.

My bureau oversees not only aviation but also land transport, maritime and logistics. Not only are we charting a path towards green aviation, we have also promulgated a series of action plans and blueprints to promote green transport and green shipping.

Our presence here today underscores a shared commitment to achieving a sustainable future for aviation. With so many distinguished experts in the room, I need not reiterate the critical importance of sustainability and decarbonisation in the aviation sector. This symposium provides a unique platform for leaders from around the world to exchange perspectives and provide solutions on green aviation. As we embark on this dialogue, I would like to begin by sharing Hong Kong's achievements and our forward-looking blueprint for building a sustainable aviation ecosystem.

When we speak of sustainability in aviation, our recent focus must be on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. This is indeed a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands co-operation and collaboration amongst a wide array of stakeholders, including governments, airlines, fuel suppliers, industry partners, and the traveling public. In Hong Kong, we are taking decisive steps to develop a SAF industry and promote the use of it at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). In our view, it is of utmost importance that we join hands to scale up the production of SAF, as we all know that it is currently the only practical means for international aviation to decarbonise.

The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is dedicated to fostering a robust SAF supply and its supply chain in collaboration with Mainland authorities and local enterprises, from upstream raw material collection to the establishment of production plants and large-scale production and supply. Given Hong Kong's close proximity to the Chinese Mainland, which has the largest supply of used cooking oil, we are leveraging this advantage to create a significant SAF supply for Hong Kong. Moreover, as 100 per cent neat SAF cannot be uplifted to aircraft at this moment, we are actively exploring the construction of a SAF blending facility right here in Hong Kong. This facility aims to support the provision of competitively priced SAF-blended jet fuel in the long run, hence raising the competitiveness of Hong Kong's SAF industry. By doing so, we also aim to strengthen the bargaining power of airlines operating from HKIA, ultimately fostering HKIA's competitiveness as an international aviation hub.

On this floor, I know that Cathay Pacific Group has been leading and is very dedicated in pushing forward the use of SAF. Of course, we would work closely with Cathay as our close partner. We are also mindful of the pragmatic and practical considerations faced by different airlines in Hong Kong. In a way, we hope to create a critical mass and to achieve and secure a reasonably priced SAF supply and production to enable us to create a robust supply chain for SAF in Hong Kong. With the above measures in place and subject to regional SAF industry development, we adopt a vision to achieve a SAF consumption ratio of 1 per cent to 2 per cent for flights departing from HKIA by 2030 as a starting point to drive momentum.

  ""The Chief Executive's Policy Address"" announced just last month includes quite some paragraphs on how we would strive ourselves to achieve the SAF consumption target. We, in a recent briefing for our legislature, disclosed the target that I mentioned just now. I received a lot of feedback asking whether Hong Kong could set a more aggressive target. Replying to the stakeholders and the legislative councillors was that we want to be pragmatic and realistic. We want to put it into action. So, we set a target which we hope to achieve. That is a starting point, and this should not preclude or hinder us from setting an even more aggressive target along the way.

Apart from the industry and aviation partners, I think public education is also very important. As we take people along from places to places, the travelling public need to raise their awareness for green aviation. It helps build a collective understanding of the role SAF plays in reducing aviation's carbon footprint. The Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) will, for instance, launch targeted publicity and promotional campaigns to raise awareness among the public and corporations about the importance of SAF, and the need for everyone to do their part. By engaging communities and businesses, we aim to create a culture of sustainability that supports long-term environmental goals. I think this culture of sustainability is the basic, core element and spirit that IATA has also been promoting around the globe.

Speaking of AAHK, I am proud to highlight their unwavering commitment to sustainability. Apart from SAF that I spoke of a lot, together with key aviation-related business partners, AAHK is dedicated to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2050, a bold step making HKIA the world's greenest airport. Their efforts to embed sustainability into new developments at HKIA, integrate environmental best interests and practices, and address climate change and resilience given the airport's coastal location have all gained significant momentum. Initiatives such as trialing renewable diesel, expanding the use of electric and autonomous vehicles on the Airport Island, as well as continuously upgrading its equipment by incorporating more energy-efficient installation and technologies reflect a holistic approach to sustainable development at HKIA.

We are all acutely aware that the journey to a sustainable future in the aviation sector is not a solo mission. It is a global challenge and mission that requires collaboration across borders, industries, and sectors. The HKSAR Government is committed to playing a pivotal role by leading, offering policy support, driving innovation and technology, and most importantly, cultivating an enabling environment for sustainable aviation. Our door is always open. We will maintain close communication with international organisations, airlines, the airport community, fuel suppliers and industry stakeholders to tackle pressing challenges and difficulties. As Dr Thomsen (Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist of IATA, Dr Marie Owens Thomsen) just mentioned, it is not just saying when there is a will, there is a way. We have to create ways so as to make our will works. It is the time not for words, but for action.

Last but not least, international collaboration is paramount in this endeavor. No single city, country, or organisation can achieve net zero alone. We must share knowledge, pool resources and align our strategies to create a unified global response to the climate crisis. We have been facing very frequent super typhoons over the past weeks and months in Hong Kong, which is quite unprecedented. Our airport and aviation community have been making our best efforts to respond, recover and resurrect, but nothing is more important than tackling this issue at the heart of the problem and do it with passion and determination. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why gatherings like this symposium are vital for fostering such partnerships.

I truly look forward to the rich discussions and innovative insights that will emerge from this symposium, sparking actionable outcomes. And with the talent and the dedication I see in this room, I am more than confident that we can turn the vision of net zero by 2050 into a reality. It's a goal championed by IATA, but it's a future we will build together.

Lastly, I wish you all productive, inspiring and impactful sessions ahead. Thank you very much.

Speech by DSJ at International Conference of Legal Regulators 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-10-21 12:37,2025-10-21 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100371.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the International Conference of Legal Regulators 2025 today (October 21):

President Tong (President of The Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Roden Tong), Dr Kelvin Wong (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you all at the International Conference of Legal Regulators today. My warmest welcome to the leaders and representatives from across the global legal regulatory community. I am particularly delighted that Hong Kong has been chosen as the venue for hosting the conference this year. Your presence here reflects our shared commitment to upholding the highest standards of the legal profession.

  The theme of this year's Conference, ""New Ways to Regulate in a Changing World?"", is not only timely but profoundly critical. We are navigating an era of unprecedented and simultaneous transformation. Breakthroughs in technology and global economic shifts present both opportunities and challenges for legal regulators worldwide. Our discussions over the coming days will focus on fostering a resilient and adaptive regulatory environment, which is essential for upholding the rule of law.

  In Hong Kong, our approach to these global challenges is firmly anchored in our constitutional principle of ""one country, two systems"". This principle, enshrined in our Basic Law, is the bedrock of our success and stability. It is the foundation that underpins our common law system, which continues to operate robustly.

  Central to this system is the independent exercise of legal and regulatory powers. Our Judiciary exercises independent judicial power free from any interference. Similarly, the regulation of legal practitioners is handled independently by the legal profession itself. The Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association, as the self-regulatory bodies for their respective professions, perform this critical function with the highest degree of professionalism, integrity, and diligence. Their work in upholding stringent ethical standards, ensuring professional competence, and administering a fair disciplinary system is conducted strictly in accordance with the law, free from interference. This independent self-regulation is a cornerstone of our legal framework and a key reason for the immense international confidence placed in Hong Kong's status as a leading international legal and dispute resolution hub.

  While our foundations are strong, we are facing several new challenges.

  First, technological disruption, particularly the development of artificial intelligence (AI), is fundamentally reshaping the practice of law. These tools offer potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve access to justice. However, they also pose regulatory questions on accountability, confidentiality of clients, and ethical practice.

  At present, the laws in Hong Kong protect the legitimate rights and interests of individuals, enterprises and various other organisations in different spheres. To manage potential risks in promoting the ongoing technological development, the Department of Justice will establish an interdepartmental working group to review the legislation needed to support a wider application of AI. This initiative is part of our broader strategy to encourage AI applications across different sectors, while ensuring that regulatory frameworks keep pace with technological advancements.

  Second, the expansion of cross-border trade amplifies the need for mediation and arbitration, which in turn necessitates a stronger regulatory framework for such services. The Department of Justice established the Working Group on Mediation Regulatory System in October last year to review the regulatory system for the accreditation and disciplinary matters of the mediation profession in Hong Kong, and to make recommendations on enhancing the professionalism of mediators. We will implement measures for strengthening the system for the mediation profession in Hong Kong by the end of this year, as well as take forward the relevant legislative work next year. These efforts aim at ensuring our regulatory frameworks remain fit for purpose in a globalised and increasingly mediated legal environment.

  Third, the increasing cross-border nature of legal practice challenges our traditionally jurisdiction-specific regulatory models. This requires the enhancement of cross-border co-operation. Exchange of insights, sharing of best practices, and building mutual understanding through collaboration is necessary.

  Hong Kong is proud to contribute to this vital global conversation. Our unique position as a gateway between the East and the West, along with our professional legal sector and robust common law system, make us a ""super connector"" in the field of legal regulation.

  Through this conference, we can pioneer the new regulatory pathways. I have every expectation that your deliberations over the next two days will be immensely stimulating, pioneering, and productive.

  I thank The Law Society of Hong Kong once again for its sterling efforts in hosting this pivotal event. To our distinguished international guests, I wish you a successful conference and a delightful stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."

Hong Kong Scholarship for Excellence Scheme opens for applications,2025-10-21 11:13,2025-10-21 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102000153.htm,"The Education Bureau (EDB) today (October 21) announced that the Hong Kong Scholarship for Excellence Scheme (HKSES) will, from today until December 31, be open for applications from eligible Hong Kong students who intend to pursue undergraduate or postgraduate studies at world-renowned universities outside Hong Kong starting from the 2026/27 academic year.

A spokesman for the EDB said, ""As a merit-based scheme targeting the most outstanding Hong Kong students, the HKSES seeks to cultivate a cadre of brilliant young achievers with a sense of social responsibility and national identity, an affection for Hong Kong and an international perspective, who will return home after receiving a world-class education supported by the scholarship to enrich Hong Kong's talent pool and competitiveness in the long run. Selection will be based on candidates' academic achievements and other attributes such as leadership qualities and potential as well as their contributions and commitment to society. Awardees are required to complete their specific study programmes and undertake to return to Hong Kong upon graduation to work for at least two years or a period equivalent to the duration of the scholarship received, whichever is longer.""

Awardees will receive a non-means-tested scholarship to cover their tuition fees, subject to a ceiling of $300,000 per annum. In addition, the HKSES will provide additional support to financially needy awardees during their studies. Awardees who have passed the means test will receive a bursary of up to $200,000 per student per annum to cover their living and study-related expenses.

丘應樺首先與土耳其共和國總統府投資與金融局局長A Burak Dağlıoğlu會面，介紹香港最新的經貿發展，以及招商引資的主要措施，以鞏固香港作為國際貿易中心及商業樞紐的地位。他亦簡介香港最新成立的內地企業出海專班，以協助內地企業開拓包括土耳其在內的海外市場。雙方並就投資推廣策略及加強兩地在「一帶一路」倡議等多個領域的合作交換意見。

丘應樺隨後與土耳其對外經濟關係委員會成員舉行商務圓桌會議，向他們分享香港在「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢及為經濟注入動力的最新舉措，例如北部都會區和電子商貿的發展。因應環球經濟格局的轉變，不同經濟體均積極拓展新興市場以應對挑戰。丘應樺指出，香港是土耳其企業開拓東南亞及粵港澳大灣區市場的理想跳板，同時作為重要平台讓有意拓展海外業務的內地企業透過香港「走出去」，促進雙向貿易和投資，讓各方受惠。

此外，丘應樺禮節性拜會伊斯坦堡省長Davut Gül，介紹香港在不同領域的最新發展，並就加強香港與土耳其的商貿合作交換意見，以建立更緊密的雙邊關係。他亦簡介粵港澳大灣區的發展，以及為土耳其企業帶來的機遇。

晚上，丘應樺出席由投資推廣署及香港貿易發展局合辦的商務晚宴，推廣香港優越的營商環境和內聯外通的獨特優勢。他向約30位出席的商界領袖表示，香港與土耳其雙邊貿易關係良好，即使受前所未有的疫情衝擊，過去五年，兩地的商品貿易平均增長約百分之四。

丘應樺指出，香港和土耳其均為各自區域內的重要門戶。香港地理位置優越，位處亞洲的中心，成為開拓中國內地和亞洲市場的貿易和投資門戶。他亦與嘉賓分享香港作為全球第五大貿易經濟體（僅次於中國內地、歐洲聯盟、美國和日本）、全球第三大金融中心、最大的離岸人民幣中心，以及全球最自由經濟體等的優勢。

他鼓勵土耳其企業來港設立區域運營基地，以享受《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》下的優惠待遇，從而進入龐大的中國內地市場。他表示，加上香港實行簡單低稅制，資金自由流通，生活方式和文化充滿活力，是一個穩定、開放且具有韌性的國際樞紐，也是通往中國內地乃至亞洲地區進行貿易、投資、創新和人文交流的渠道。

晚宴前，丘應樺亦藉此機會與中國駐伊斯坦布爾總領事魏曉東會面，介紹香港的最新發展和深化國際交往合作的工作。

丘應樺將於十月二十一日（伊斯坦堡時間）轉赴格魯吉亞第比利斯，出席第比利斯絲綢之路國際論壇。"
SCED promotes HK's role as springboard to foster two-way investment and trade on visit to TÃ¼rkiye (with photos),2025-10-21 09:00,2025-10-21 09:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100188.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, on his visit to Istanbul, Türkiye, on October 20 (Istanbul time) promoted Hong Kong's unparalleled advantages and its role as a springboard to foster two-way investment and trade with a view to strengthening the partnership between Hong Kong and Türkiye.

 Mr Yau first met with the President of the Investment and Finance Office of the Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye, Mr A Burak DaÄlÄ±oÄlu, to brief him on Hong Kong's latest economic and trade developments, and major measures to attract enterprises and investment to consolidate the city's position as an international trade centre and business hub. He also introduced the latest establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global in Hong Kong to assist Mainland enterprises in exploring overseas markets including the Turkish one. They also exchanged views on investment promotion strategies and enhancing collaboration between Hong Kong and Türkiye in various areas including the Belt and Road Initiative.

 Mr Yau then held a business roundtable with members of the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Türkiye to share with them Hong Kong's unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and latest initiatives such as the Northern Metropolis Development and e-commerce to inject economic impetus. In view of the changes in the global economic landscape, various economies are proactively exploring emerging markets to cope with challenges. He noted that Hong Kong is an ideal springboard for Turkish enterprises to tap into the Southeast Asian and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) markets, while at the same time serving as a key platform for Mainland companies seeking to expand their overseas business to go global via Hong Kong, boosting two-way trade and investment to benefit all.

 Mr Yau also paid a courtesy call on the Governor of Istanbul, Mr Davut Gül, to give him an update on Hong Kong’s latest developments in various fields and exchange views on business and trade collaboration between Hong Kong and Türkiye to forge closer bilateral ties. He also briefed him on the development of the GBA and the business opportunities it presents for Turkish enterprises.

 In the evening, Mr Yau attended a business dinner organised by Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to promote Hong Kong's premier business environment and unique advantages of being closely connected to both the Mainland and the world. Speaking to some 30 participating business leaders, he said that Türkiye and Hong Kong have very good bilateral trade relationships. The merchandise trade between the two places during the past five years has seen an average growth of about 4 per cent despite the unprecedented hit of the pandemic.

 Mr Yau noted that the two places are both important gateways in their respective regions. Hong Kong is at a strategic location, right at the centre of Asia, enabling the city to serve as the gateway to trade and investments in the Chinese Mainland and the Asian markets. He also shared with the guests Hong Kong's strengths as the world's fifth-largest trading entity (after the Chinese Mainland, the European Union, the United States and Japan), the third-ranked global financial centre, the biggest offshore Renminbi centre and the world's freest economy, among others.

 He encouraged Turkish enterprises to set up their base of regional operations in Hong Kong to enjoy the preferential treatment under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement to enter the vast Chinese Mainland market. He said that coupled with its simple and low tax system, free flow of capital and vibrant lifestyles and culture, Hong Kong is a stable, open and resilient international hub and a conduit to the Chinese Mainland and the broader Asian region for trade, investment, innovation and people-to-people exchange.

 Before the dinner, Mr Yau took the opportunity to meet with the Chinese Consul-General in Istanbul, Mr Wei Xiaodong, to keep him abreast of Hong Kong's latest developments and efforts to deepen international co-operation and exchange.

 Mr Yau will depart for Tbilisi, Georgia, on October 21 (Istanbul time) to attend the Tbilisi Silk Road Forum."

再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-20 20:55,2025-10-20 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000795.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月二十日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，並呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的兩歲女童。她昨日（十月十九日）開始出現發燒及抽搐，今日到雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院急症室求醫，需留院治理，目前情況嚴重。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H3）呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發腦病變。

中心調查發現，女童於部分潛伏期身處廣東省，並於十月十七日到港。她尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至十月二十日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有556宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（59宗）、小學（298宗）及中學（199宗）。計及上述個案，中心由開學至今錄得十一宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎2至17歲，其中九人過往的健康狀況良好。市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃已經展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。今年所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。

此外，政府亦已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間普通科門診和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
​財庫局局長就檢討政府採購機制專責小組提出的先行措施會見傳媒談話內容（附短片）,2025-10-20 19:20,2025-10-20 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000741.htm,"財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）局長許正宇今日（十月二十日）公布檢討政府採購機制專責小組提出的先行措施。以下為財庫局局長和首長級甲一級政務官劉焱會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：請問你們暫時在今次事件中，看到最大及最關鍵的錯誤及疏漏為何？這些措施是否能有效堵塞存心詐騙的行為？第二，有關紀律調查物流署及庫務科人員，會包括甚麼職級？會否包括已開展退休前休假的前物流署署長陳嘉信？他已經開展退休前休假，你們會否再追究？

財經事務及庫務局局長：管理建議書內的相關建議，以及我們自己檢討採購制度的情況時，都明顯看到其中一個比較大的因素是對盡職審查這方面的重視不足。過去很多同事做這方面，例如是投標評估，又或合約管理，很多時是針對書面文件去處理。但我們看到今次盡職審查中的很多方面其實不單是涉及文書方面的工作，也可以包括是實地視察，也可以是有需要時，他們有所謂的red flag、見到有問題的，可以盡快去處理。因此，今次整套先行措施有一個很核心的內容，就是怎樣能夠提升同事在採購時的盡職審查能力，以及他們的關注度和具體怎樣去做。當然我們希望做到的不單是他們有權可用，同時他們也要有權識用和有權敢用。故此，不單在條款上，包括指引、合約方面，我們要多做一點，同事培訓和意識的提高也是同樣重要。正如剛才我介紹，我們與物流署同事的交流會差不多有200位同事參加，這個工作文化的變化，或者是重塑工作文化的事情是要持續的。歸根究柢，我覺得盡職審查能力的提升，以及怎樣更好地去賦能同事做好這方面的工作，是我們今次的一個重點。

第二個問題就是今次調查工作的範圍。管理建議書內也提出，很多具體事務牽涉的都不止於個別層面的同事，既有前線，也有中層，亦有高層的。所以不要管他究竟是退休，或是未退休，又或者是否在職也好，我相信整個調查工作都會包括得到。

記者：剛才局長提到，就盡職審查的重視不足，是否採購樽裝水的整個過程都沒有程序上的出錯？將來所有採購是否都會用評分制和盡職審查去避免相同情況發生？第二，想追問剛才行家問的問題，就紀律調查，如果發現已退休的陳嘉信有問題，如何進行紀律處分？

財經事務及庫務局局長：你應該記得在八月宣布三重行動時，我答應大家和社會，會有先公布先行措施的安排。何以我們要這樣做呢？因為我們覺得，優化或提升整個採購制度，我們是責無旁貸的。這次飲用水事件是個很好的契機，讓我們能夠整全地看待這件事。今天的公布其實是一個中途站，專責小組稍後還會有整體的長遠優化方案，包括具體的入標要求、科技運用等，讓我們能整體提升採購工作的能力。今次的措施牽涉盡職審查方面的優化，包括是指引方面更明確，例如在合約條款列明政府不需要得到預先批准，就可以直接進行實地視察，又例如假設在合約管理的執行期間，我們覺得承辦商可能未能履約，便能夠即時終止合約。這些都是希望賦予同事更大權力，讓他們在管理和處理標書評估時，有更大動力做好把關工作。

正如我所說，這個只不過是客觀的載體，具體如何運用這些權力，都需要同事敢用和識用。因此，一方面我們需要重塑工作文化，另一方面，在部門與部門之間也要強化資訊互通，讓大家在看到例如高風險的承辦商，看到一些問題，這些信息可以與其他部門分享。那麼，其他同事即使不是同一個部門或處理同一件事，也可以去參考。

剛才提到紀律調查，我也說得很清楚，管理建議書內指出，其實不單是前線，也包括中層和高層同事都牽涉在內。因此，調查對象的範疇不單局限於那個層面，而是自上而下都包括在內。第二方面，Alice（首長級甲一級政務官劉焱）的角色就是具體去釐清每位同事在這件事上的相關責任，當有結論後，再由公務員事務局去定奪怎樣處理。

記者：你好，局長。報告內提到公司印章的名稱不正確，有明顯的詐騙跡象，這個是審計署的說法，也有指部門沒有人即時向相關執法機構舉報。想知道當中有否可能涉及某些政府官員或職員犯罪的行為？這會否是未來調查的優先方向？

財經事務及庫務局局長：正如我剛才所說，今次調查主要涉及紀律方面的調查，包括若有違反政府法規，是否導致紀律方面的問題，又或是員工或同事本身的工作表現與他的職級和經驗不相稱而導致管理問題。這些都是我們調查的重點。剛才你提及的正正體現何以我們要有先行措施，因為其中一個重點就是要重塑工作文化，令同事有權可用、有權敢用和有權識用。

記者：想問一下，剛才說目標是在年底前完成調查。如果完成調查後，除了紀律調查，會不會有刑事檢控或其他發現是有違規的，甚至有犯法行為？

財經事務及庫務局局長：刑事方面，執法部門早前已經介入和做相關工作，所以這不是我們調查範圍的一部分。更重要的是，如剛才我所說，紀律和管理方面的考慮是這次調查的重點。

首長級甲一級政務官劉焱：讓我補充一下，我明白大家很關心紀律調查會包括多少人員，以及在過程中如發現違法情況的處理。請大家放心，我們作為公務員，如在日常工作中發現有違法情況，我們都有責任舉報和跟進。我並非假設我們進行調查過程時會發現有新的違法情況，但即使有，亦不會因為我們只是進行紀律調查而就把我們可能發現的違法情況輕輕放下，所以大家可以放心。

記者：想問一下，說到會修訂《招標和合約的標準條款》，可以進行實地視察和核實第三方的一些資料。其實在鑫鼎鑫飲用水事件中，是否涉及審核，又或沒有進行實地視察、沒有核實的漏洞呢？可否再交代清楚一點當中的過程？

財經事務及庫務局局長：其實現行就算未做這些先行措施，合約內亦有一個比較整體的條款，就是承辦商要配合我們做標書審核的工作，或履行合約的工作。我們為何要特別聚焦處理盡職審查，以及剛才你所說的第三方核證，包括實地視察呢？因為在這次事件中，我們看到同事在洞察和察覺潛在問題時，以及盡職審查時，的確是有些疏漏。因此，我們一方面希望提升同事這方面的能力，同時也讓他們有更多權力，能夠根據條款更聚焦、更具體地，當發現問題，例如看到有虛假情況，又或一些問題令他覺得承辦商不能夠履約時，他能夠即時終止合約。我們希望這件事能夠更好地賦權同事，做好他們作為政府採購把關者的角色。

最新個案資料

個案涉及一名48歲女子，住所位於元朗區。初步調查顯示，她於十月十日至十一日到訪廣東省汕尾市及揭陽市。她在十月十七日出現發燒、關節痛和皮疹，昨日（十月十九日）到天水圍醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

她有兩名家居接觸者，三人一同到汕尾市及揭陽市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學察。

由於她在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得42宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月十二日至十八日）廣東省新增2 086宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與上周（十月五日至十一日）的2 257宗有所下降。上周大部分個案（795宗）在江門市錄得，其次為佛山（241宗）、深圳（202宗）及廣州（189宗），全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：
• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

勞工及福利局局長就失業率會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2025-10-20 18:30,2025-10-20 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000692.htm,"​以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十月二十日）出席全國勞動模範和大國工匠代表團歡迎儀式後會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：多謝大家來到全國勞動模範和大國工匠代表團的歡迎儀式，看看大家有沒有問題？

記者：今日剛公布失業率，其實從年初到現在失業率一直上升，雖然升幅不算高，你如何看這個數字，會否擔心下一季會再升？你認為影響因素是甚麼？第二題是最新一季的餐飲服務業的失業率維持不變，你認為這個數字是否反映了當局在保障本地勞工上的成效，政策力度會否不夠？隨後會否有其他行動？

勞工及福利局局長：今日剛公布最新的七至九月份的失業率由3.7%升了0.2%至3.9%，香港現正經歷經濟轉型期，所以我們看到有些行業的失業率有上升。大家都留意到建造和零售業皆有上升，反之而言如金融業我們見到有下跌，至於大家都關心的餐飲業就維持平穩，和上次一樣不變。

展望接下來的日子，十月份的經濟活動都是好的，尤其是十月份有國慶黃金周，所以遊客和消費都應該比上兩個月有所增長。展望未來日子，隨着遊客數目的增長、隨着經濟的增長，對於就業市場應該可以帶來正面的幫助。

我們見到這次餐飲業的失業率維持不變，這顯示第一，我們的經濟有活力，餐飲方面有需求。另外，大家關心在輸入勞工方面，餐飲業佔的比例相對其他行業是高一些，正如我早前提到，在補充勞工優化計劃中，約三萬多人中有一半屬餐飲業，而當中的一半、即佔總數的四分之一左右是初級廚師，或者是侍應生，我們過去幾個月在這方面均採取一些再收緊的措施，這包括本地僱員與輸入勞工的二比一人手比例，由全公司計算改為以這兩個工種計算，而它的招聘時間一般是四個星期，這兩個工種我們要求增加至六個星期。

另外，我們也公布了針對所有輸入勞工的安排，例如公開僱主的名稱、資料等。此外，這兩個行業我們要求僱主一定要每個星期有一節要到勞工處的就業中心進行實地招聘。這些都會對於本地勞工優先就業起到正面作用，我們會持續去做這些措施。在接下來的日子，我相信隨着經濟活動的增長，再加上我們強調要本地勞工優先就業，會對本地勞工提供更多的就業機會。

記者：建造業於失業率中有較明顯的升幅，是否與輸入勞工相關？預計失業率會否繼續上升？政府會如何支援？另外亦想問，就補充勞工優化計劃已完成的68宗投訴個案中，有67宗沒有足夠證據，是否進行搜證時遇到困難？還是機制未盡完善？

勞工及福利局局長：在建造業方面，相信大家都留意到發展局聯同建造業議會早前都發布了新的信息，提出了一系列的「組合拳」，為建造業工友提供更多培訓，再加上政府額外投放多300億在基建方面，這都會對建造業帶來正面幫助。

另外，大家都關心當有投訴的時候，我們跟進的個案如果屬實，政府會採取甚麼行動、以至行政制裁？我們會認真處理每一宗的投訴，處理過程中會秉持要公平公正、要以實證為本，所以我們每一宗個案都會十分仔細去調查。如果調查當中發現可能存在一些誤會、或者一些信息雙方可能不清楚的話，投訴不成立，我們都是要判斷為不成立。但是如果成立的話，我們一定會嚴肅跟進，包括以行政制裁的手法，對於一些不守規定的僱主施以懲罰。

大家見到有60多宗投訴，只有一宗成立，這不代表說機制運行得不好，反而大家要這樣看，大家只要有任何擔心、有疑惑的，作出投訴是好事來的。但政府作為執行公權力的機構，我們是要公平公正地調查，所以每一宗我們都會仔細去看。事實上，我們現正跟進調查一些投訴，如果發現當中有任何違反規定要求的話，我們會毫不留手進行行政制裁，但整個過程是要本着公平公正的方針去跟進處理。謝謝。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-20 18:30,2025-10-20 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000687.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 20), one new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

  The case involves a 48-year-old female living in Yuen Long District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Shanwei and Jieyang in Guangdong on October 10 and 11. She developed a fever, joint pain and rash since October 17. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tin Shui Wai Hospital and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment yesterday (October 19). She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

The patient's two household contacts, who travelled with her to Shanwei and Jieyang, are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

Since the patient stayed in Guangdong Province during her incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 42 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 086 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 12 to 18), showing a decrease compared to the previous week, which reported 2 257 cases (October 5 to 11). Most of the cases (795 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (241 cases), Shenzhen (202 cases) and Guangzhou (189 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The Government attaches great importance to youth development. The HYAB promulgated the Youth Development Blueprint in end-2022, which states that the Government will further strengthen the breadth and depth of the Mainland and international internship and exchange programmes with a view to enhancing young people's understanding of the country and supporting their integration into the overall development of the country. Through the HYAB Funding Scheme for Youth Internship in the Mainland, the HYAB and the YDC provide funding for NGOs to organise youth internship projects on the Mainland for young people to experience the actual workplace environment there first-hand and deepen their understanding of the Mainland's employment market, workplace culture and development opportunities. It will help young people set their future career goals, accumulate work experience, build interpersonal networks and boost their employment prospects.

SFST speaks on quick-win measures proposed by Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime (with video),2025-10-20 17:58,2025-10-20 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000640.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, on quick-win measures proposed by the Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime today (October 20):

Reporter: We would like to ask if the Government would consider mobilising the senior civil servants accountability mechanism if human error was identified among such kind of civil servants. And would you elaborate a little bit on the role of the new Procurement Management Audit Section (Procurement and Stores Management Audit Section) of the GLD (Government Logistics Department) compared to its previous roles? Thank you.

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: I'll address the second part of your question first. Basically, if you look at the current setup or the role of the GLD's audit team, it's more about the goods, also inspection of goods and services being available, and at the same time to ensure compliance with the relevant government regulations in the procurement process. But as I said at the outset, one of the key elements that we've identified in this current exercise is that the importance of due diligence is something we need to pay more attention to. That's why, in line with this discovery and also in line with this revelation, the scope of work of this audit team was expanded to cover and to ensure that the due diligence work of our colleagues is being well taken care of in the process of their procurement efforts. And that's why, to couple with that, we also have clear guidelines being set out in such a way that they know what to do. The audit team will, on a random checking basis, identify those high-risk areas and also high-risk items, and look at those items to ensure that proper due diligence is being looked into. This is the response to your second question.

For the first question about the interface of this investigation with the accountability system set out in the Policy Address: As you may appreciate, the accountability system set out in the Policy Address needs certain legislative amendments to be effective. This is something to be done by our Civil Service Bureau. So this current exercise is undertaken in the context of the current regime with no regard to the future regime because that future regime is yet to be effective.

Reporter: Firstly, what was the issue with the past due diligence checks and what way can the Government rectify the problem, if you could elaborate more. And secondly, on the disciplinary investigation, how many people are subject to this investigation? Why is Ms Lau the right person to be in charge? Did the Government consider having a retired judge to head the probe? Could the internal disciplinary investigation eventually lead to any criminal proceedings? Thank you.

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: If you look at how the current procurement is being done, as I said earlier and also responded to some of the questions asked, basically we very much relied on submissions or documents being presented to us. But in this fast-changing world, in light of the fact that fraud can take different forms, I think we need to take a more proactive approach in terms of enhancing our due diligence capabilities. That's why, throughout these interim measures I just introduced, which are being implemented, one of the key areas that we look into is how we can enhance that area. Like, for example, we already issued guidelines to make sure that our colleagues on the procurement side are here to do due diligence work, including not just the paper exercise, but also checking of information online. And also, at the same time, if there's a need, they could do on-site inspection to really look into the information being available to them, to see if they are genuine or not. At the same time, there will also be provisions being given to them to allow third-party checking of the information that they're given, so they don't really have to rely solely on the source of information to verify the information but rather they can resort to third-party checking to ensure that information that they are given is genuine. So what we are trying to do is to ensure first of all, our colleagues are being empowered with the right tools and means to enhance their due diligence work. At the same time, in terms of mindset, they have the ability and also have the willingness to exercise those rights and powers. That's exactly one of the key areas that we emphasise.

In terms of your second question about the scope of work of the investigation, as I said and also as Alice (Administrative Officer Staff Grade A1 Ms Alice Lau) just mentioned, taking into account the scope of the current work, it will include around more than 10 of our GLD and also our FSTB (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau) colleagues. At the same time, regardless of whether they are retired or not, they are also subject to the investigation. For those that involved criminality, these will be taken care of by our law enforcement agencies. This is not something that we are looking into. But rather, as said by Alice, we will look into potential disciplinary and also management issues and deal with them head-on in light of the current regime.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"

That's why, in line with this discovery and also in line with this revelation, the scope of work of this audit team was expanded to cover and to ensure that the due diligence work of our colleagues is being well taken care of in the process of their procurement efforts. And that's why, to couple with that, we also have clear guidelines being set out in such a way that they know what to do. The audit team will, on a random checking basis, identify those high-risk areas and also high-risk items, and look at those items to ensure that proper due diligence is being looked into. This is the response to your second question.

For the first question about the interface of this investigation with the accountability system set out in the Policy Address: As you may appreciate, the accountability system set out in the Policy Address needs certain legislative amendments to be effective. This is something to be done by our Civil Service Bureau. So this current exercise is undertaken in the context of the current regime with no regard to the future regime because that future regime is yet to be effective.

Reporter: Firstly, what was the issue with the past due diligence checks and what way can the Government rectify the problem, if you could elaborate more. And secondly, on the disciplinary investigation, how many people are subject to this investigation? Why is Ms Lau the right person to be in charge? Did the Government consider having a retired judge to head the probe? Could the internal disciplinary investigation eventually lead to any criminal proceedings? Thank you.

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: If you look at how the current procurement is being done, as I said earlier and also responded to some of the questions asked, basically we very much relied on submissions or documents being presented to us. But in this fast-changing world, in light of the fact that fraud can take different forms, I think we need to take a more proactive approach in terms of enhancing our due diligence capabilities. That's why, throughout these interim measures I just introduced, which are being implemented, one of the key areas that we look into is how we can enhance that area. Like, for example, we already issued guidelines to make sure that our colleagues on the procurement side are here to do due diligence work, including not just the paper exercise, but also checking of information online. And also, at the same time, if there's a need, they could do on-site inspection to really look into the information being available to them, to see if they are genuine or not. At the same time, there will also be provisions being given to them to allow third-party checking of the information that they're given, so they don't really have to rely solely on the source of information to verify the information but rather they can resort to third-party checking to ensure that information that they are given is genuine. So what we are trying to do is to ensure first of all, our colleagues are being empowered with the right tools and means to enhance their due diligence work. At the same time, in terms of mindset, they have the ability and also have the willingness to exercise those rights and powers. That's exactly one of the key areas that we emphasise.

In terms of your second question about the scope of work of the investigation, as I said and also as Alice (Administrative Officer Staff Grade A1 Ms Alice Lau) just mentioned, taking into account the scope of the current work, it will include around more than 10 of our GLD and also our FSTB (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau) colleagues. At the same time, regardless of whether they are retired or not, they are also subject to the investigation. For those that involved criminality, these will be taken care of by our law enforcement agencies. This is not something that we are looking into. But rather, as said by Alice, we will look into potential disciplinary and also management issues and deal with them head-on in light of the current regime.

Dr Kevin Lau (Founding Convenor of the Hong Kong Youth Professional Global Advocacy), distinguished guests, young leaders, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my pleasure to join you all today at the Global Youth Powerhouse Summit 2025. Let me begin by extending my heartfelt congratulations to the Hong Kong Youth Professional Global Advocacy for your unwavering commitment to empowering young talent and building bridges across borders. Bringing together such a vibrant and diverse group from over 30 nationalities is a remarkable achievement and a testament to your vision.

  Standing here in Hong Kong, a city where East meets West, and where tradition meets innovation, I am reminded of our city's unique role as a global crossroads. Just as Hong Kong has long been connecting people and ideas from across the world, today's summit brings together bright minds and ambitious spirits, symbolising the energy and promise of Hong Kong and our youth.

  This is a time of both challenges and opportunities for young professionals. The world you are navigating is fast changing. Geopolitical shifts, economic uncertainties, rapid advances in technology, and issues like climate change, gender and public health are reshaping the global landscape. The digital revolution has further hastened the pace and impact of changes. What happens in one corner of the world can quickly ripple across the globe.

  For young people nowadays, these changes may spark unease. But they also create new horizons. For example, in Hong Kong, our city's unique position under ""one country, two systems"" gives us unmatched advantages in connecting with both the Mainland and the wider world. With national strategies like the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the Greater Bay Area, there are new opportunities in fields such as finance, healthcare, technology, and the creative industries. The future is not just something to wait for. It is something our younger generation is already helping to shape.

  But to seize these opportunities, I encourage you to keep an open and forward-looking mindset. Think beyond your own field and even your own city. Engage with the pressing issues of our times, whether it is the rise of AI, the need for sustainable development, or the need to bridge divides among cultures. By telling your stories, listening to and seeking to understand others, you can help build a global community founded on respect, innovation, and shared purposes.

  Let me share a quick example from my own field, the legal profession, which has undergone profound changes thanks to lawtech and AI. Tasks that once took hours, like document review or drafting contracts, can now be completed in minutes. This has brought significant gains in efficiency, affordability, and access to justice. But it also challenges us to rethink our roles and responsibilities, to safeguard trust, privacy, and fairness even as we embrace innovation.

 Regardless of your professional fields or interests, the lesson is the same: Technology is a powerful tool, but it cannot replace the human qualities that matter most, such as empathy, judgment, and integrity. As you move forward, keep learning, stay open to new ideas, and remember the value of your own voice.

  Dear friends, the future truly is in your hands. Think big, think boldly. Don't be afraid to reach beyond what seems possible. Your determination and creativity will be the impetus for the future development of our city and the world.

 I wish you all a rewarding and enjoyable Summit. Thank you very much."

尊敬的魏地春團長（中華全國總工會副主席）、劉松林部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室社會工作部部長）、李新宇處長（中央港澳工作辦公室、國務院港澳事務辦公室五局二處處長）、各位代表團成員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天十分高興，和大家一同熱烈歡迎中華全國總工會率領全國勞動模範和大國工匠代表團到訪香港。我衷心感謝中央港澳辦、國務院港澳辦的全力支持，促成代表團這次的訪問，充分體現國家對香港的重視和愛護。今年是中華全國總工會成立100周年，成就非凡，意義重大。我祝賀全總邁向新征程，功業更輝煌。

這次訪港代表團中，共有七位全國勞動模範和先進工作者，其中更有兩位同時獲頒授國家表揚勞工最高等榮譽的大國工匠。我感謝你們專程訪問，為廣大香港勞工打氣及為社會注入正能量。你們在不同領域，包括航天、航空、人工智能、航運、金融、餐飲及文化藝術，以百折不撓的精神攻堅克難、守正創新、建功立業，為國家繁榮和社會進步作出卓越的貢獻，我和香港市民都為你們取得的突出成就感到驕傲，熱切期待了解更多你們的奮鬥事跡和成功故事。

代表團訪港的活動包括：與本地傑出勞工分享；與職業訓練局學員及世界技能大賽香港代表隊成員交流；深入社區與中學生和市民分享；參觀立法會；以及考察數碼港及啟德體育園等。我深信這些交流會啟迪香港的勞工，也希望能增進你們對香港在各領域最新發展的了解。

勞動力是推進歷史的主體，勞工為社會經濟發展的基礎。特區政府及社會各界非常重視勞工的價值，並舉辦不同活動及比賽，嘉許在工作、工藝及專業領域有突出表現的僱員。我期望通過這次訪港活動，不但增強港人的民族自豪感與愛國情懷，更激發各行業的僱員在工作上迎變求變、敬業樂業；正接受培訓的學員在技藝上努力鑽研、追求卓越；求學中的學生在擇業上認清目標、勇於追夢；以及廣大市民在社會上群策群力、發光發熱。

香港當前正處於經濟轉型的關鍵時期，挑戰和機遇並存。獅子山精神是香港的精神象徵，代表自強不息、靈活應變和團結互助。獅子山精神與勞模精神、勞動精神和工匠精神一脈相承。我堅信憑藉香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，只要我們堅持信念，同心同德，一定可以跨越挑戰，再創高峯。

最後，我預祝代表團訪港之行順利圓滿，取得豐盛成果。我亦祝各位勞動模範代表繼續發揮專長、再立新功，共同為國家作出新的貢獻！"

Employers and employees should make prior work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-10-20 17:20,2025-10-20 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000254.htm,"  As the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 (T3) is now in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (October 20) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of establishments, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements and contingency measures for periods during and after tropical cyclone warnings and rainstorm warnings, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees, as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or when the extreme conditions come to an end, and when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when a tropical cyclone warning, rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.
 
  When a Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement is issued during working hours, within two hours before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is expected to take effect, employers should release employees from workplaces or from work in stages or arrange for them to work remotely according to the agreed work arrangements. To ensure the safety of employees and to enable them to arrive home before suspension of public transport services, employees who have mobility problems (for example, pregnant employees or those with a disability), employees who rely on transport services which are prone to being affected by adverse weather conditions (for example, ferry services) to get home, and those who work in or are living in remote areas (for example, outlying islands) should be given priority to leave. Other employees should be released from workplaces or from work in stages according to their travelling distance or the time required for returning home.
  
  If an Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.
   
  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance on the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) or higher, Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.
  
  The spokesman also reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.

  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when there is a T8 signal or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

僱主僱員應預先訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-10-20 17:20,2025-10-20 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000257.htm,"由於三號熱帶氣旋警告信號現已生效，勞工處今日（十月二十日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主在擬訂及執行在熱帶氣旋及暴雨警告下及其後的工作安排和應變措施時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。

當天文台在工作時間內、預計八號熱帶氣旋警告信號生效前的兩小時內發出預警，僱主應按協定的工作安排讓僱員分批離開工作地點、下班或遙距工作。為確保僱員安全和趕及在公共交通服務停止前回家，一些行動不便的僱員（例如懷孕或殘疾僱員）、須依靠容易受惡劣天氣影響的交通服務（例如渡輪服務）返回居所的僱員，以及於偏遠地點工作或居住的僱員（例如離島），應獲准優先離開。僱主亦應安排其他僱員按返家路程的距離或所需時間分批離開工作地點或下班。

如果黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外及空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣或極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號、黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。

另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2025-10-20 17:10,2025-10-20 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000620.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（十月二十日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在十月十二日至十八日期間，衞生防護中心錄得三宗退伍軍人病個案，當中兩宗屬社區感染，一宗屬輸入個案。詳情如下：

社區感染個案：

41歲男病人，有長期病患，居於大埔區；及
68歲男病人，過往健康良好，居於觀塘區。


輸入個案：

69歲男病人，有長期病患，居於中國內地。


衞生防護中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這三宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至十月十八日，今年錄得132宗退伍軍人病個案。本港於二○二四年及二○二三年分別錄得135及121宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：

避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2025-10-20 17:10,2025-10-20 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000622.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (October 20) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From October 12 to 18, the CHP recorded three LD cases. Among them, two were community-acquired cases and one was an imported case. The details of the cases are as follows:

Community-acquired cases:

a 41-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living in Tai Po District; and
a 68-year-old male patient with good past health living in Kwun Tong District.


Imported case:

a 69-year-old male patient with underlying illnesses living on the Chinese Mainland.


The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that these are sporadic cases. No epidemiological linkages have been established between these three cases and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of October 18, 132 LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2024 and 2023, there were 135 and 121 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpools and spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or vessels.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpools and spas, water fountains and home apparatus that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


âThe public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.

Director of Health attends WHO Western Pacific Regional Committee meeting and DH elected as official rapporteur for current session (with photos),2025-10-20 17:05,2025-10-20 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000561.htm,"  âThe Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, today (October 20) led a delegation from the Department of Health (DH) to attend the meeting of the 76th session of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Committee for the Western Pacific in Fiji. He engaged in in-depth discussions with representatives from other countries and regions on major health issues of common concern. They explored practical response strategies and ways to strengthen the resilience of health systems. Dr Lam also shared on public health and medical reforms and achievements in Hong Kong, China.

  During the opening session today, Dr Lam reported on the latest developments and challenges in public health in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). ""The HKSAR has established a resilient public health system. We have enjoyed one of the best indices in terms of life expectancies, maternal and infant mortality rates, etc, as well as quality healthcare services. These achievements are attributed to a solid foundation established across various public health areas, including disease surveillance, disease prevention, and responsive medical services. At the same time, the HKSAR shares many challenges with other member states of the WHO, such as an ageing population, the ongoing strain on the healthcare workforce, the dual threats of non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases, and rising healthcare expenditure,"" Dr Lam said.

  To address the abovementioned issues, ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that Hong Kong, China is deepening its healthcare reform and enhancing the sustainability of the Hong Kong healthcare system through a series of measures. These include enhancing the public healthcare system, promoting healthcare manpower development, strengthening primary healthcare services, enhancing cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment, promoting the development of Chinese Medicine (CM), promoting mental health, and developing an international health and medical innovation hub.

  ""Hong Kong, China is pressing ahead with targeted, far-reaching health reforms. We are transforming our primary health care from a treatment focus to a prevention focus and tailoring it to individual health needs; exploring systemic solutions to alleviate healthcare workforce pressures; accelerating the responsible adoption of artificial intelligence and smart and digital healthcare systems to enhance the efficiency and coverage of our services; taking forward health promotion and disease prevention initiatives in a life-course approach; and mobilising resources to tackle health issues of vulnerable groups,"" Dr Lam added.

  He emphasised that the theme of the WHO Western Pacific Region, ""Weaving Health for Families, Communities and Societies in the Western Pacific Region (2025-2029)"", closely aligns with the healthcare reform objectives outlined in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"". Hong Kong, China will continue to collaborate closely with the WHO to advance global and Western Pacific regional health objectives.

  The five-day meeting runs until October 24. During the meeting, participants will also discuss mental and psychological health care, the impact of climate change on health system safety and resilience, oral health, alcohol control, artificial intelligence in healthcare systems, hypertension control, safer surgery and tobacco control, among other topics. The Controller of Regulatory Affairs of the DH, Dr Fung Ying, will introduce the HKSAR's new phase of tobacco control measures at the meeting. The DH was unanimously elected by all member states and regions of the WHO Western Pacific Region to serve as the official rapporteur for this session, responsible for ensuring that the resolutions adequately reflect the views of member states and regions to promote the effective implementation of the regional programme.

  With the support of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, the DH has actively collaborated with and supported the WHO in addressing various public health challenges and contributing to global public health over the years. The DH has been designated by the WHO as a Collaborating Centre for Traditional Medicine and a Collaborating Centre for Smoking Cessation and Treatment of Tobacco Dependence, assisting the WHO in formulating global strategies for traditional medicine. Furthermore, the DH regularly provides training programmes on tobacco controland training in smoking cessation treatment for healthcare professionals as well as tobacco control and smoking cessation practitioners in the HKSAR, on the Chinese Mainland and throughout the entire Western Pacific Region. The DH also conducts CMAcupuncture Smoking Cessation Training Workshops to help frontline CM practitioners enhance their knowledge and skills in delivering cessation treatment. Regarding training, to date, over 1 000 individuals have participated in these programmes and training.
