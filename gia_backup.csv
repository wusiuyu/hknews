衞生署舉辦「香港牙科服務新里程」研討會　慶祝牙科服務成立八十周年（附圖）,2025-06-14 17:00,2025-06-14 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400526.htm,"​衞生署今日（六月十四日）於香港故宮文化博物館演講廳舉辦題為「香港牙科服務新里程」的研討會，邀請內地和海外知名牙科學者和本地業界探討促進口腔健康的路向和措施，為香港牙科服務的可持續發展注入新動能，同時慶祝衞生署牙科服務成立八十周年的重要里程碑。

醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授、衞生署署長林文健醫生、現任衞生署牙科服務主任顧問醫生許美賢醫生，聯同衞生署四位前任牙科服務主任顧問醫生一同為研討會的開幕式主禮。

盧寵茂教授在致辭時說：「口腔健康是整體健康不可或缺的一環。政府去年底公布的口腔健康及牙科護理工作小組總結報告，引領香港將口腔健康及牙科護理體系由『重治療、輕預防』，扭轉為『重預防、早發現、早治療』。通過『做闊做淺』的策略廣泛向所有年齡層市民推廣以預防為重的基層口腔健康護理，並以『做窄做深』的策略聚焦為弱勢社群提供必需的治療性牙科護理服務。」

他強調，政府今年三月推出的「青少年護齒共同治理先導計劃」正是「做闊做淺」的項目，鼓勵青少年預防牙患；而上月剛推出的「社區牙科支援計劃」則屬於「做窄做深」的措施，為弱勢社群（包括有經濟困難的長者）加強提供牙科服務。政府期望與牙科專業界別、培訓機構、非政府組織，以及市民大眾攜手合作，共同迎接香港牙科服務的新紀元，持續推進各項措施，共同推動全民口腔健康。

林文健醫生致歡迎辭時說：「衞生署牙科服務自一九四五年成立，八十年來有長足發展。從戰後初期以提供緊急脫牙服務為主，到一九六一年香港食水加入氟化物以應對及預防牙患，至一九八○年為全港小學生推出以預防為本、深受家長歡迎的學童牙科保健服務，以及後來為有特殊口腔護理需要的人士提供的醫院牙科專科服務，夯實各項針對長者及社會弱勢社群的各項社區牙科護理計劃等，衞生署牙科服務正不斷擴展，迎合社會需求，提質提量。」

他指出，衞生署牙科服務致力與香港一同成長，日後會繼續以政策革新、善用科技及社會協作，積極落實各項口腔健康行動計劃，重點為市民提供預防性護理，並為弱勢群體推行專項社區牙科服務，促進全港市民的口腔健康，保存牙齒。

世界衞生組織（世衞）西太平洋區域主任Saia Ma'u Piukala醫生亦為研討會發表視像致辭。世界衞生組織口腔健康科學轉化合作中心主任小川祐司教授、北京大學口腔醫學院口腔預防保健科主任鄭樹國教授及英國倫敦大學學院特殊護理牙科顧問醫生Navdeep Kumar則擔任主講嘉賓，分別闡述了世衞的《口腔衞生全球戰略和行動計劃（2023-2030年）》、內地在促進全球口腔健康的政策和實踐工作、為有特殊需求的成年患者提供牙科護理的挑戰與創新等議題。

研討會亦邀請了十六間一直積極參與「長者牙科外展服務計劃」、「護齒同行」及「特殊口腔護理服務」等政府資助牙科項目的非政府組織及合作夥伴出席，分享他們在服務長者及有特殊需要社群方面的豐碩成果。

除研討會外，衞生署口腔健康促進科以牙科服務成立八十周年為主題佈置的陽光笑容流動教室，將會巡迴全港各區向全民推廣口腔健康。詳情稍後將於「愛牙 Love Teeth HK」Facebook專頁公布。"

Renowned dental academics from the Mainland and overseas, as well as local dental professionals explored the way forward and measures to promote oral health and foster the sustainable development of the dental services in Hong Kong. The symposium also celebrated the important milestone of the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the DH's Dental Services.

The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau; the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; the incumbent Consultant in-charge of the Dental Services of the DH, Dr Kitty Hse; and four former Consultant in-charge of the Dental Services of the DH officiated at the opening ceremony of the symposium.

In his address, Professor Lo said, ""Oral health is vital to overall health. At the end of last year, the Government released the final report of the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care, shifting the focus of Hong Kong's oral health and dental care system from treatment-oriented to an approach targeting prevention, early identification and timely intervention. The Government adopts the strategies of widely promoting among citizens across all age groups prevention-oriented primary oral healthcare, and provides essential curative dental care services targeting underprivileged groups.""

He stressed that the Primary Dental Co-care Pilot Scheme for Adolescents launched by the Government in March 2025 is an initiative of widely promoting among citizens, encouraging adolescents to prevent dental diseases while the Community Dental Support Programme launched last month is an initiative focusing on enhancing dental services for the underprivileged (including elderly who have financial difficulties). The Government looks forward to collaborating with the dental professionals, training institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the members of the public to usher in a new era of dental services in Hong Kong, and continue to enhance various initiatives to promote oral health for all.

Dr Lam said in his welcoming speech, ""Since its establishment in 1945, the Dental Services of the DH has achieved significant development over the past 80 years. From providing emergency dental extraction service during the post-war period to introducing fluoridation of drinking water in Hong Kong in 1961 to combat and prevent dental diseases; to rolling out the prevention-oriented School Dental Care Service for all primary school students in Hong Kong in 1980, which has been well-received by parents; to providing specialist dental services to patients with special healthcare needs; and to implementing various community dental care programmes to cater for the needs of the elderly and underprivileged, etc. The Dental Services is expanding to meet the needs of the society, enhancing both the quality and quantity of services."" 

He added that the Dental Services of the DH endeavours to grow alongside Hong Kong, and will continue to actively implement the Oral Health Action Plan through policy innovations, leveraging on technology and community collaboration, with emphasis on providing preventive care to the public and special community dental services to underprivileged groups, in order to promote oral health and the retention of natural teeth.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for the Western Pacific, Dr Saia Ma'u Piukala, also delivered a video message for the symposium. The keynote speakers were Professor Hiroshi Ogawa, the Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Translation of Oral Health Science; Professor Zheng Shuguo, the Chairman of the Department of Preventive Dentistry of the School of Stomatology of Peking University; and Dr Navdeep Kumar, Consultant in Special Care Dentistry of University College London. They shared insights on topics such as the WHO Global Strategy and Action Plan on Oral Health (2023-2030), the Mainland's policy and efforts to promote global oral health, and the challenges and innovations in providing dental care to adult patients with special needs.

Sixteen NGOs and partners who have been actively participating in government-subsidised dental programmes such as Outreach Dental Care Programme for the Elderly, Healthy Teeth Collaboration and Special Oral Care Service, were invited to attend the symposium to share their fruitful achievements in serving the elderly and persons with special needs.

Apart from the symposium, the Bright Smiles Mobile Classroom of the DH's Oral Health Promotion Division, decorated with a theme celebrating the 80th anniversary of the establishment of the Dental Services, will tour around Hong Kong districts to promote oral health to the public. Details will be announced on the Facebook fan page of ""æç Love Teeth HK"" later. "

Customs officers intercepted the 35-yer-old incoming female passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (June 13) and seized about 44 200 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $181,000 and a duty potential of about $146,000 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

The event offers unparalleled access to industry leaders, cutting-edge fintech trends, and high-growth opportunities for positioning companies at the forefront of innovation.

  Mr Ng said, ""The visit was highly fruitful, underscoring the strong economic relationship and vibrant investment exchanges between Hong Kong and Canada. It highlighted Hong Kong's distinctive role as a 'super connector' linking global markets, offering Canadian businesses valuable pathways for expansion into Asia. This engagement not only reinforced ties between the two markets but also unlocked exciting collaborative opportunities.""

  Participants at the events expressed keen interest in Hong Kong's business environment and connectivity. Investor Relations Officer, Velocity Incubator, University of Waterloo, Mr Andrew Martinko, said, ""We learned from Invest Hong Kong about their strong commitment to driving tech innovation through action. They presented a dynamic and expanding start-up ecosystem, clearly focused on welcoming talented Canadian founders and connecting them with high-potential Asian markets and diverse funding opportunities, all within close geographic reach.""

  Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of XSIM AI Canada Inc, Ms Shan Tao, said ""Participating in the StartmeUpHK Festival was a pivotal moment for XSIM AI Canada Inc. The support and insights from InvestHK and the Hong Kong-Canada Business Association helped us uncover the unique opportunities within Hong Kong's ecosystem. It ultimately led to a conditional offer from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation's Soft Landing Programme, and the establishment of our business there. Hong Kong is where our vision for practical, scalable, purpose-driven industrial AI found both strategic alignment and real momentum - advancing economic value and environmental impact.""

  Partner at DS Avocats and Honorary Secretary of the Federation of Hong Kong Business Associations Worldwide, Ms Cindy Ho, facilitated high-level connections during the trip and shared her insights. She said, ""Canada and Hong Kong share a robust and time-tested business relationship, driving trade, investment, and innovation. With Hong Kong serving as a vital hub for Canadian businesses expanding into Asia, and Canadian expertise fuelling innovation in Hong Kong, this dynamic exchange is unlocking new opportunities and reinforcing bilateral trade and investment in the global economy. As a legal professional working closely with international businesses, I have seen firsthand how Canada and Hong Kong businesses can benefit namely through the Hong Kong-Canada Income Tax Agreement. Together, we are building a future of shared prosperity and ambition, backed by strong trade and investment agreements and a long-term commitment to sustainable growth."""

Employers and employees should make prior work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-06-14 12:20,2025-06-14 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400350.htm," As the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 (T3) is now in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (June 14) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of establishments, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

 ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements and contingency measures for periods during and after tropical cyclone warnings and rainstorm warnings, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

 To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees, as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or when the extreme conditions come to an end, and when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions.

 ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when a tropical cyclone warning, rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

 When a Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement is issued during working hours, within two hours before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is expected to take effect, employers should release employees from workplaces or from work in stages or arrange for them to work remotely according to the agreed work arrangements. To ensure the safety of employees and to enable them to arrive home before suspension of public transport services, employees who have mobility problems (for example, pregnant employees or those with a disability), employees who rely on transport services which are prone to being affected by adverse weather conditions (for example, ferry services) to get home, and those who work in or are living in remote areas (for example, outlying islands) should be given priority to leave. Other employees should be released from workplaces or from work in stages according to their travelling distance or the time required for returning home.

If an Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance on the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) or higher, Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

The spokesman also reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

 ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.

Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when there is a T8 signal or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
僱主僱員應預先訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-06-14 12:20,2025-06-14 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061400346.htm,"由於三號熱帶氣旋警告信號現已生效，勞工處今日（六月十四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主在擬訂及執行在熱帶氣旋及暴雨警告下及其後的工作安排和應變措施時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。

當天文台在工作時間內、預計八號熱帶氣旋警告信號生效前的兩小時內發出預警，僱主應按協定的工作安排讓僱員分批離開工作地點、下班或遙距工作。為確保僱員安全和趕及在公共交通服務停止前回家，一些行動不便的僱員（例如懷孕或殘疾僱員）、須依靠容易受惡劣天氣影響的交通服務（例如渡輪服務）返回居所的僱員，以及於偏遠地點工作或居住的僱員（例如離島），應獲准優先離開。僱主亦應安排其他僱員按返家路程的距離或所需時間分批離開工作地點或下班。

如果黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外及空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣或極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號、黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。

另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

截至今年五月底，系統於短時間內有效偵察到該路段共16宗交通事故，大部分為輕微交通意外。當中11宗於10秒內偵察到，並即時發出警示予管控人員跟進，較以往主要由管控人員透過閉路電視定時排查以識別交通事故，大幅縮短偵察時間近九成，提升了效率和應對能力。

運輸署發言人表示：「為進一步檢視先導計劃的成效，我們將於今年六月二十一日中午時段進行操作測試，評估駕駛人士是否遵從管制燈號正確使用路肩，並收集相關操作的數據，作為優化先導計劃及制定未來推展智慧公路策略的參考。」

運輸署會聯同相關部門持續監察先導計劃，按實際情況適當調整系統及運作安排，確保道路和行車安全。"

Motorists should heed special traffic arrangements during smart motorway operational test at Ting Kau Bridge southbound at noon on June 21 (with photos/video),2025-06-14 10:00,2025-06-14 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/14/P2025061301147.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (June 14) announced that a smart motorway operational test will be conducted at the road section of Ting Kau Bridge southbound (Tsing Yi bound) at noon on June 21 (Saturday) for about 15 minutes.

During the test, the fast lane of Ting Kau Bridge southbound will be temporarily closed while the hard shoulder will be open for traffic for the first time. The speed limit will also be reduced to 50 km/h accordingly at the above road section. The TD reminds motorists to pay heed to the lane control signals and speed limits on site when passing through the road section at the above time, and follow the instructions for safe driving.

The trial of the Smart Motorway Pilot Scheme at Ting Kau Bridge southbound launched from December 29, 2024 has been operating smoothly to date. With the application of artificial intelligence technologies, the newly installed Automatic Incident Detection System effectively assists operation staff of the Tsing Ma Control Area in detecting and handling traffic incidents more expeditiously, allowing traffic to resume normal as soon as possible.

As of end-May 2025, the System has effectively detected a total of 16 traffic incidents occurred at the road section within a short time, most of which were minor traffic accidents. Among them, 11 incidents were detected within 10 seconds and immediate alerts were issued to operation staff for follow-up. Compared to the past where operation staff mainly relied on regular CCTV checks to identify traffic incidents, the detection time has now been significantly reduced by nearly 90 per cent, raising the efficiency and capability to respond to incidents.

A spokesman for the TD said, ""To further evaluate the effectiveness of the Pilot Scheme, we will conduct the operational test at noon on June 21, 2025 to assess motorists' compliance with the control signals and their proper use of the hard shoulder, and collect relevant operational data as reference for optimising the Pilot Scheme and formulating the implementation strategy of smart motorways in future.""

The TD will continue to monitor the Pilot Scheme in collaboration with relevant departments, and make suitable refinements to the System and operational arrangements with regard to actual circumstances to ensure road safety and safe motoring."

In his keynote speech at a seminar and networking reception themed ""From Hong Kong to the World: Embarking on the New Journey of Innovation"" organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), Professor Sun said Hong Kong is forging ahead with a clear vision to develop as an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre, and is committed to pushing boundaries, embracing change, and seizing global opportunities.

Professor Sun said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been introducing agile policies, building world-class infrastructure and facilitating global I&T collaboration. He noted the flagship research and development (R&D) initiative, InnoHK, fosters global R&D collaboration. Hong Kong is also carrying out meticulous planning for building artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, including AI Supercomputing Centre opened last year and the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute to be established, together with $10 billion dollars-worth Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund channeling more market capital to turbocharge strategic industries, with AI at the core.

Highlighting that Hong Kong being an ideal gateway for global enterprises to enter the Mainland market, Professor Sun said the HKSAR Government has been actively attracting overseas and the Mainland I&T enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. Companies choosing HK for the international headquarters exemplify Hong Kong’s important role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world, serving as a two-way springboard for attracting overseas enterprises and helping Mainland enterprises to ""go global"".

During the seminar and networking reception, Professor Sun also exchanged views with members of the local I&T sector, investors and start-ups' founders on I&T development and collaboration.

Professor Sun also visited the Hong Kong Tech Pavilion. Twenty start-ups from the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation and Cyberport participated this year, showcasing cutting-edge solutions and innovations in areas of AI, robotics, HealthTech, sustainable and ClimateTech, and Fintech. At the same time, Professor Sun toured the Canada Pavilion set up by Canada which was selected as country of the year for VivaTech 2025, the China Pavilion and pavilions set up by other leading enterprises and start-ups where he had a brief exchange with representatives of the participating organisations to learn more on their innovative solutions.

In the evening, Professor Sun met with Mr Emmanuel Carcassonne, the Chairman of La French Tech Hong Kong-Shenzhen, a community dedicated to supporting the development of the French startup ecosystem both in France and internationally. Professor Sun said that Hong Kong is a reliable partner for French startups to settle and expand businesses in Hong Kong.

In the afternoon, Professor Sun paid a courtesy call on Minister Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in France Mr Chen Li, to brief him on the work of developing Hong Kong into an international I&T centre, enhancing the I&T ecosystem, fostering co-ordinated development among upstream, midstream and downstream, as well as the city's continuous efforts in integrating into national I&T development.

Professor Sun will continue his visit to Paris today (June 14, Paris time) and depart for the Netherlands on June 15 (Amsterdam time)."

Shirley (Special Representative for Hong Kong Economic and Trade Affairs to the European Union, Ms Shirley Yung), Christopher (Director of France, Spain and Portugal of the HKTDC, Mr Christopher Lai), distinguished speakers, guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon! Bonjour! What an honour to stand before you at VivaTech 2025, where the future unfolds in the heart of Paris, a city that has long been a powerhouse of creativity and innovation.

Walking through the exhibition earlier, I could sense the electric energy of young entrepreneurs, the boldness of the start-ups, and the sheer drive for innovation in every corner. It is a spirit Hong Kong knows well. Today, I am here to share how Hong Kong is not only keeping pace with this tech revolution, but also helping to lead it.

Driving innovation: Hong Kong's grand vision

Hong Kong is forging ahead with a clear vision – to become a leading international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. Guided by our I&T development blueprint (Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint) promulgated in December 2022, we have introduced a series of targeted measures to consolidate our research and development (R&D) strengths, accelerate transformation of R&D outcomes and promote the development of tech industries of strategically importance to us including life and health sciences, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, as well as advanced manufacturing and new energy. These efforts have significantly strengthened the I&T ecosystem in Hong Kong, putting us firmly on the right track to unlocking new possibilities.

But vision alone is not enough, we believe in action. Just as VivaTech embodies a spirit of exploration, Hong Kong is committed to pushing boundaries, embracing change, and seizing global opportunities. That's why we are introducing agile polices, developing world-class infrastructure, and forging partnerships that span the globe.

Global Collaboration: InnoHK's expanding reach

You may have heard of InnoHK, our flagship R&D initiative that fosters global R&D collaboration. Currently, we host 30 labs in partnership with 30 top-notch universities and research institutes from 12 economies under two research clusters focusing on AI and robotics, and health technologies. And today, I am thrilled to share that we are launching a third cluster focusing on sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing, and materials. France, with your leadership in green energy, is the natural partner. I am confident that, together, we can turn research into real-world impact.

AI: Powering the next frontier and the future

AI is spearheading a new wave of technological revolution and industrial transformation. It is not just the future, it is happening right now. Hong Kong is all in. The solid R&D capabilities and world class talent we have are the best asset supporting our city's AI aspiration. Five of our universities rank among the world's top 50 for data science and AI, positioning Hong Kong as a leading AI hub in Asia.

Our robust AI infrastructure, including the AI Supercomputing Centre which opened last year and the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute to be established, provides solid support to the industry on AI-related research and application. Furthermore, a $10 billion Hong Kong dollars-worth Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund, equivalent to around 1.1 billion euros, will be there to channel more market capital to turbocharge strategic industries, with AI at the core. We are not just adopting AI, but we are investing in shaping the future.

Hong Kong: A gateway for global enterprises

To bolster downstream industry development, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been actively attracting I&T enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong. For example, companies like BeyonCa, a premium electric vehicle start-up backed by the Renault Group and Dongfeng Motor Group, has chosen Hong Kong for its international headquarters and final assembly plant. This decision is a testament to Hong Kong's strategic location, favourable business environment, and growing potential in advanced manufacturing. It also exemplifies Hong Kong's important role as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world, serving as a two-way springboard for attracting overseas enterprises and helping Mainland enterprises to ""go global"".

Hong Kong's next chapter: shaping the future together

Ladies and gentlemen, innovation is not about incremental steps - it is about leaps. At the Hong Kong Tech Pavilion in Hall 1, you will see 20 pioneering start-ups from our two I&T flagships - Hong Kong Science Park and Hong Kong Cyberport proving just that. From AI to life and health tech, they are redefining what is possible.

Before I close, let me leave you with words from Lei Jun (é·è»), who transformed Xiaomi into a global tech leader: ""Dream big, start small, and act fast. The speed of execution is everything in innovation."" To every innovators and entrepreneurs here: whether you are from France or beyond, your next big idea deserves a launchpad that moves as fast as you do. Let's make it happen in Hong Kong!

Thank you. Merci."
禁毒綜藝電視節目　回顧60年禁毒歷史　展望無毒香港（附圖／短片）,2025-06-13 23:04,2025-06-13 23:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300353.htm,"禁毒常務委員會（禁常會）呈獻的大型禁毒綜藝電視節目《一齊企硬．唔Take嘢》今日（六月十三日）晚上在將軍澳電視廣播城舉行。政務司司長陳國基在節目上致辭，並聯同保安局局長鄧炳強、禁常會主席李國棟醫生、保安局副局長卓孝業等為節目主禮，為一連串精彩禁毒表演揭開序幕。

陳國基致辭時表示，在上世紀六十年代，香港深受毒品問題困擾。自禁常會成立以來，一直匯聚政府和社會各界力量同心抗毒。從一九七七年有記錄以來至二○二四年，被呈報吸毒者總人數跌幅高達七成。而去年涉及嚴重毒品案而被捕的21歲以下青少年人數，創下有記錄以來的新低。香港的禁毒工作取得驕人成就，禁常會功不可沒。

他說：「今年是禁毒常務委員會成立60周年，我很高興能夠在這個重要時刻，參與今日的節目，和大家一起回顧本港禁毒工作的發展……我代表特區政府向所有曾參與禁毒工作的人士，致以衷心的謝意……我呼籲各位市民幫忙宣揚『一齊企硬 唔Take嘢！』的決心，一同攜手邁向無毒未來，守護好每一位市民的健康。」

在開幕禮上，陳國基帶領一眾主禮嘉賓啓動裝置，七款象徵不同毒品的道具隨即掉進一象徵銷毀裝置的機關，代表害人不淺的毒品皆被銷毀。陳國基帶領一眾主禮嘉賓宣讀禁毒口號「一齊企硬 唔Take嘢！」，起動一連串的精彩禁毒表演。

李國棟醫生通過錄影短片為節目致辭時表示，香港的禁毒工作取得進展，實在有賴全港市民積極參與，60年來幾代人齊心嚴厲打擊毒品。他感謝各位前人對禁毒工作作出的貢獻。他又說：「我邀請電視機前的你，繼續踴躍參與禁毒工作。我相信有你們的參與，無毒香港，指日可待。」

於節目上，一眾青春偶像及歌手獻唱正向歌曲，包括禁毒主題曲《青春作風》，以輕快的節奏帶出正能量，鼓勵年輕人堅守正向人生觀。

香港海關的「香港海關青年發展計劃」成員於一歌唱環節中，演奏豎琴及表演舞蹈，透過古典音樂及現代舞的衝擊，帶出正向興趣不但能擴闊視野、展現才能，更能鞏固禁毒決心。

香港警務處的「禁毒領袖學院」成員表演花式跳繩和富活力的嘻哈舞蹈，告訴觀眾透過運動鍛煉出強健體魄和堅毅意志，是抵抗毒品誘惑的其中一個最佳途徑。武術運動員莫宛螢及乒乓球運動員黃鎮廷亦分別於此環節中，以他們的拿手好戲——剛柔並濟的武術（套路）和以速度見稱的乒乓球球藝，為年輕人打氣。

懲教署的「更生先鋒領袖」成員，以街頭音樂表演模式，彈奏夏威夷小吉他、電子琴及吉他，希望藉此引起年輕人共鳴，並希望透過演奏的歌曲表達，健康的精神狀態是遠離毒品的必要元素。

另外，節目亦安排藝人演出以成功戒毒人士經歷改編而成的短劇，並由該戒毒人士參與演出。

節目由禁常會及保安局禁毒處合辦、電視廣播有限公司製作，以回顧香港60年來的禁毒歷史，並凝聚社會力量，共同打擊毒禍，展望無毒香港。節目有來自不同界別，包括學生、青少年團體、教育及社福等代表參與。此節目為禁常會成立60周年紀念活動之一。

節目將於六月二十一日晚上九時在無綫電視翡翠台播出，歡迎市民收看，一起傳遞禁毒信息，共同建設無毒香港。"
Anti-drug variety TV programme reviews 60 years of anti-drug history envisioning drug-free Hong Kong (with photos/video),2025-06-13 23:04,2025-06-13 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300474.htm,"  The large-scale anti-drug variety TV programme ""Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!"" presented by the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) was held at TVB City in Tseung Kwan O this evening (June 13). The Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, delivered a speech at the programme and officiated at the kick-off ceremony of a series of spectacular anti-drug performances along with the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung; the Chairman of ACAN, Dr Donald Li; the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk, and other guests.

  Mr Chan said in his speech that Hong Kong was previously plagued by drug problems in the 1960s. Since the establishment of ACAN, the Government and various sectors of the community have been working together to combat drug problems. From 1977, when records started to be kept, to 2024, the total number of reported drug abusers has dropped by as much as 70 per cent. Last year, the number of young people under the age of 21 arrested for serious drug offences was at a record low. ACAN has been instrumental in the success of Hong Kong's anti-drug efforts.

  He said, ""This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of the Action Committee Against Narcotics. I am glad to be able to take part in the programme today and review with everyone the development of the anti-drug efforts in Hong Kong on this important occasion...On behalf of the HKSAR Government, I would like to express heartfelt gratitude to all those who have participated in the anti-drug cause...I would like to appeal to all members of the public to help spread the steadfast message of 'Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!' and work together towards a drug-free future to safeguard the health of every member of the public.""

  At the opening ceremony, Mr Chan led the officiating guests in activating a device, after which seven props symbolising different drugs were dropped into a machine symbolising the destruction of pernicious drugs. Mr Chan led the officiating guests to read out the anti-drug slogan ""Let's Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!"" to launch a series of spectacular anti-drug performances.

  Delivering a speech through a recorded short video for the programme, Dr Li said that the progress of Hong Kong's anti-drug efforts owed a lot to the active participation of members of the public in Hong Kong and the concerted efforts of several generations in the fight against drugs over the past 60 years. He thanked everyone who had participated in anti-drug work before for their contributions. ""I invite you, in front of the TV, to continue to participate actively in the anti-drug efforts. I believe that with your participation, a drug-free Hong Kong is just around the corner,"" he added.

  In the programme, various young idols and singers performed songs with positive messages, including an upbeat anti-drug theme song that shares with young people positive energy and encourages them to hold dear to positive values in life.

  Members of Hong Kong Customs' ""Customs YES"" played the harp and danced in a musical segment. Through the impact of classical music and modern dance, a message was conveyed that positive hobbies not only broaden one's horizons and let one's talents shine, but also strengthen one's determination against drugs.

  Members of the Hong Kong Police Force's ""Leadership Institute on Narcotics"" performed rope skipping and hip hop dance with energetic vibes, letting the audience know that one of the best ways to resist the temptation of drugs is to build a strong body and a determined mind through sports. Wushu athlete Juanita Mok and table tennis athlete Wong Chun-ting also cheered for youngsters in this segment with their respective fortes - Wushu (Taolu) that combines strength and flexibility, and table tennis, which is known for its speed.

  Members of the Correctional Services Department's ""Rehabilitation Pioneer Leaders"" performed in the form of busking with ukulele, electric piano and guitars, in the hope of striking a chord with young people and expressing through the songs that a healthy state of mind is essential for staying away from drugs.

  In addition, the programme has arranged for artists to re-enact short plays based on the true stories of rehabilitees who have successfully quit drugs. The rehabilitees have participated in the plays themselves.

  Co-organised by the Narcotics Division of the Security Bureau and ACAN, and produced by Television Broadcasts Limited, the programme aims to review Hong Kong's anti-drug history over the past 60 years and rally community support for combating drug problems. Audience members from different sectors, including students, youth groups and representatives from the education and social welfare sectors, attended the programme. This programme is one of the eventsheld in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of ACAN.

  The programme will be broadcast on TVB Jade at 9pm on June 21. Members of the public are welcome to watch and disseminate anti-drug messages for building a drug-free Hong Kong together."
"Two property owners fined over $110,000 in total for carrying out unauthorised building works",2025-06-13 22:42,2025-06-13 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061301064.htm,"âTwo owners of detached houses on Redhill Peninsula pleaded guilty at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts yesterday (June 12) for carrying out unauthorised building works (UBWs), contravening section 14(1) of the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123) (BO), namely, knowingly carrying out building works without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD). They were fined over $110,000 in total by the court.

The BD discovered certain UBWs at the two detached houses during a large-scale operation in September 2023 to inspect houses along the coastal area of Redhill Peninsula. Investigation by the BD found that the owners of the two houses had knowingly carried out the concerned building works without the prior approval and consent from the BD, contravening section 14(1) of the BO. Hence, the BD instigated prosecution action against the two owners under section 40(1AA) of the BO in August last year. The two owners were convicted and fined $30,000 and $82,980 respectively yesterday.

A spokesman for the BD said today (June 13), ""The Redhill Peninsula incident reveals that coastal detached houses with UBWs or illegal occupation of government land can pose safety hazards and risks to nearby slopes. If such contraventions are discovered, the BD will take vigorous enforcement actions and instigate prosecution actions. Property owners should consult building professionals before carrying out building works to ensure compliance with the BO.""

The spokesperson said that these are the first two convictions for contravening section 14(1) of the BO in relation to the Redhill Peninsula incident. The BD has already instigated prosecutions against 30 detached houses on Redhill Peninsula, including the above two houses. Court hearings for these cases are being rolled out.

Ice cream sample detected with coliform bacteria count exceeding legal limit,2025-06-13 22:34,2025-06-13 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061301075.htm,"âThe Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (June 13) that a sample of locally manufactured pistachio-flavoured ice-cream was found to contain coliform bacteria and its count exceeding the legal limit. The CFS is following up on the incident.

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a licensed frozen confection factory in Sha Tin for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 260 coliform bacteria per gram, exceeding the legal limit.""

""The CFS has informed the frozen confection factory concerned of the irregularity and instructed it to stop selling and to dispose all the affected ice-cream immediately. The CFS has also provided health education on food safety and hygiene to the staff of the frozen confection factory, who have also been requested to carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises,"" the spokesman said.

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

The CFS will continue to follow up on the incident and take appropriate action to safeguard food safety and public health. An investigation is ongoing."

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

歡迎大家出席由香港特區政府舉辦的「中華文化節2025」開幕酒會。

香港是國際城市，薈萃中西，具備深厚中華文化底蘊。特區政府去年成立弘揚中華文化辦公室，通過多元化的展覽、交流、合作、推廣活動等，讓市民體會中華文化的精髓，加強國家認同，傳承和宣揚家國精神。

弘揚中華文化辦公室去年舉辦首屆「中華文化節」，成功舉辦超過250場演出和活動，吸引高達90萬的參與人次。多項節目大獲好評，有效提升民族和文化自信，而為培育年輕一代而設的「普及中華文化藝術專場」，更惠及超過7 000名師生及社區人士，成績令人鼓舞。

今年的「中華文化節」將呈獻超過280場節目及活動，為廣大市民和旅客帶來豐富精彩的中華文化藝術演出。文化節的開幕節目是由中國東方演藝集團演出的現代舞詩劇《詩憶東坡》，以充滿創意的現代舞蹈，展現蘇軾這位著名文學家的詩詞與人生。表演融會詩詞、國畫、書法、古琴等中華傳統文化元素，通過嶄新手法演繹蘇東坡廣為傳誦的詩篇，為觀眾帶來耳目一新的體驗。

政府會充分發揮香港在「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，向世界弘揚優秀的中華傳統文化，透過香港的國際網絡向世界說好中國故事。

政府去年公布的《文藝創意產業發展藍圖》，以弘揚中華傳統優秀文化為重要的工作方向。我有信心「中華文化節」會成為香港的年度文化品牌活動，將博大精深、絢爛多彩的中華文化，以創新手法呈現觀眾眼前。我們會繼續向香港市民和來自海外及內地的旅客傳揚中華文化的精粹，實現「以文塑旅、以旅彰文」，達致文旅共融、相互帶動的作用。

但願人長久，千里共嬋娟。蘇東坡精練的詩句，寫出了千百年來世人的美好願望。就讓我們藉「中華文化節」繼續傳承及發揚中華文化！多謝大家。"

I would now like to turn to our English-speaking friends.

Welcome to the opening reception of the Chinese Culture Festival 2025.

Launched last year by the Government, the Chinese Culture Festival aims to showcase the remarkable virtues of traditional Chinese culture to the world. In 2024, we successfully presented over 250 performances and activities, attracting a substantial attendance of 900 000.

This year, the second edition of the Chinese Culture Festival will present more than 280 programmes and activities. To kick-start the Festival, this evening we are presenting a contemporary dance drama to you. Titled ""Dongpo: Life in Poems"", this performance is brought to you by the China Oriental Performing Arts Group, and uses a variety of innovative means to present Chinese poetry, calligraphy, painting and music.

Other Festival programmes include Chinese operas, local performances as recognised by the China National Arts Fund, as well as specially curated programmes co-organised with the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Hong Kong Member Association and arts and cultural organisations.

Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. We will make full use of Hong Kong's position as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange to promote the beauty of Chinese culture.

An important strategic direction featured in the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development, published by the Government last year, is on the promotion of the profound traditional Chinese culture. I am confident that the Chinese Culture Festival will become a new major annual cultural event in Hong Kong, attracting not only local residents but also Mainland and overseas tourists with its vibrant programme.

I wish the Festival a resounding success, and all of you an enjoyable evening. Thank you."
兩名紅山半島業主因僭建被法庭定罪和判罰款合共逾十一萬元,2025-06-13 19:45,2025-06-13 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300815.htm,"​兩名紅山半島獨立屋業主由於進行僭建工程，違反《建築物條例》（第123章）第14（1）條，即明知未事先獲得屋宇署批准及同意便進行建築工程，昨日（六月十二日）在東區裁判法院表示認罪，被法院判處罰款共逾十一萬元。

屋宇署於二○二三年九月開展大規模行動，巡查紅山半島臨海一帶獨立屋，在涉事兩幢獨立屋發現僭建物。屋宇署調查發現，兩幢獨立屋的業主明知未事先獲得屋宇署批准及同意便進行有關建築工程，違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條。屋宇署遂於去年八月根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條對業主提出檢控。兩名業主昨日分別被定罪及判處罰款三萬元及八萬二千九百八十元。

屋宇署發言人今日（六月十三日）說:「紅山半島事件揭示沿海獨立屋如有僭建或非法佔用政府土地情況，會對周遭斜坡構成安全隱患和風險。如發現違規情況，屋宇署會嚴正執法並提出檢控。業主在物業進行建築工程之前，應先諮詢建築專業人士的意見，確保建築工程符合《建築物條例》的規定。」

發言人表示，這是紅山半島獨立屋僭建事件首兩宗違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條被定罪個案。計及涉事兩幢獨立屋，屋宇署已先後向紅山半島30幢獨立屋提出檢控，法院正陸續展開聆訊。

根據《建築物條例》第40（1AA）條的規定，任何人明知而違反《建築物條例》第14（1）條（即在未事先獲得屋宇署的批准及同意，展開或進行任何建築工程），即屬犯罪，一經定罪，可處罰款四十萬元及監禁兩年；及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款二萬元。

政府早前提出修訂《建築物條例》的建議，當中包括針對未依時遵辦法定通知或命令和嚴重僭建物的罪行增加罰則以加強阻嚇力。政府正草擬修訂法例，目標是在二○二六年上半年向立法會提交草案。"

李國棟主席（禁毒常務委員會主席）、各位禁毒常務委員會委員、各位嘉賓、各位觀眾：

大家好！禁毒常務委員會在一九六五年成立，一直為政府就禁毒策略方面出謀獻策。今年是禁毒常務委員會（禁常會）成立60周年，我很高興能夠在這個重要時刻，參與今日的節目，和大家一起回顧本港禁毒工作的發展，並且宣傳禁毒的信息。

在上世紀六十年代，香港深受毒品困擾。自從禁常會成立以來，一直匯聚政府和社會各界力量同心抗毒。經過大家多年的努力，以及透過宣傳教育、治療及康復服務、立法和執法等多管齊下的策略，香港的毒品問題大幅改善。

從一九七七年有紀錄以來至二○二四年，被呈報吸毒者總人數跌幅高達七成。而去年涉及嚴重毒品案而被捕的21歲以下青少年人數亦創下有紀錄以來的新低。香港的禁毒工作取得驕人成就，禁常會實在是功不可沒。在這裏，我代表特區政府向所有曾參與禁毒工作的人士，致以衷心的謝意！

毒品形勢日新月異，政府抗毒的工作當然要與時並進。近來大家最關注的毒品問題，相信一定是「太空油毒品」。政府已經在今年二月修例，將「太空油毒品」的主要成分列為毒品，令執法部門可以更有效執法，提升阻嚇力，進一步打擊「太空油毒品」的禍害。

政務司司長出席大型禁毒綜藝電視節目《一齊企硬．唔Take嘢》致辭（只有中文）,2025-06-13 19:40,2025-06-13 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300820.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（六月十三日）在大型禁毒綜藝電視節目《一齊企硬．唔Take嘢》的致辭：

李國棟主席（禁毒常務委員會主席）、各位禁毒常務委員會委員、各位嘉賓、各位觀眾：

大家好！禁毒常務委員會在一九六五年成立，一直為政府就禁毒策略方面出謀獻策。今年是禁毒常務委員會（禁常會）成立60周年，我很高興能夠在這個重要時刻，參與今日的節目，和大家一起回顧本港禁毒工作的發展，並且宣傳禁毒的信息。

在上世紀六十年代，香港深受毒品困擾。自從禁常會成立以來，一直匯聚政府和社會各界力量同心抗毒。經過大家多年的努力，以及透過宣傳教育、治療及康復服務、立法和執法等多管齊下的策略，香港的毒品問題大幅改善。

從一九七七年有紀錄以來至二○二四年，被呈報吸毒者總人數跌幅高達七成。而去年涉及嚴重毒品案而被捕的21歲以下青少年人數亦創下有紀錄以來的新低。香港的禁毒工作取得驕人成就，禁常會實在是功不可沒。在這裏，我代表特區政府向所有曾參與禁毒工作的人士，致以衷心的謝意！

毒品形勢日新月異，政府抗毒的工作當然要與時並進。近來大家最關注的毒品問題，相信一定是「太空油毒品」。政府已經在今年二月修例，將「太空油毒品」的主要成分列為毒品，令執法部門可以更有效執法，提升阻嚇力，進一步打擊「太空油毒品」的禍害。

除了立法和執法，我們亦非常重視預防教育和宣傳，提高市民的抗毒意識。今天這個節目，動員了一眾藝人、紀律部隊以及成功戒毒的朋友，透過舞蹈、戲劇等不同元素，將禁毒信息帶入家家戶戶，希望大家觀賞節目後，可以學到實用的禁毒知識，一起「向毒品說不」！

最後，我呼籲各位市民幫忙宣揚「一齊企硬．唔Take嘢」的決心，一同攜手邁向無毒未來，守護好每一位市民的健康。多謝各位！"

署理財經事務及庫務局局長在2025財新夏季峰會「內地與香港金融合作：新聯通、新動能」專題討論發言全文（只有中文）,2025-06-13 18:55,2025-06-13 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300740.htm,"以下是署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂今日（六月十三日）在2025財新夏季峰會「內地與香港金融合作：新聯通、新動能」專題討論發言全文：

各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家好！很榮幸能夠參加2025財新夏季峰會，與各位共同探討內地與香港金融合作的新聯通、新動能。

香港在「一國兩制」的制度下，憑藉資金自由進出、穩健的法治基礎、完善的金融基建以及與國際接軌的監管制度，已發展成為亞洲領先的國際金融中心。在最新一期《全球金融中心指數》中，香港繼續排名全球第三，亞洲第一；香港並在投資管理、保險業與融資等多個領域名列全球第一，充分反映香港的綜合實力與國際信心。

我們一直致力於深化內地與香港金融市場的聯通，促進資金、產品、機構和人才的雙向流動，讓香港更好地發揮「引進來、走出去」的雙重平台角色。

在資本市場方面，我們見證着令人鼓舞的增長。今年五月底，香港股票市場總市值達到40.9萬億港元，較去年同期上升百分之二十四；今年首五個月平均每日平均成交額超過2,400億港元，較去年同期上升超過一倍。今年首五個月的首次公開招股集資金額達到777億港元，較去年同期上升超過七倍。當中有26家來自內地的新上市公司，凸顯香港把國際資金「引進來」投資內地企業的重要功能。

今年截至五月，「滬港通」和「深港通」的北向交易平均每日交易額為1,760.8億人民幣，較去年同期上升百分之三十三；而南向交易平均每日交易額則達1,088.8億港元，較去年同期上升百分之一百九十一。這不僅體現出國際投資者對利用「互聯互通」透過香港投資內地市埸的高度信任，也反映香港為內地投資者多元化配置資產中的獨特作用，進一步發揮香港重要的橋樑功能。

在債券市場方面，二○二四年香港是亞洲區最大的亞洲國際債券發行中心，連續17年排名區內第一。二○二四年相關發行總額超過1,300億美元，按年增長百分之五十。同時，香港已成為離岸人民幣債券發行的首選平台。二○二四年，在港發行的離岸人民幣債券總額達10,716億人民幣，按年增長超過百分之三十六。事實上，自二○○九年起，財政部已連續17年在港發行人民幣主權債券，而多個內地省市政府亦選擇在港發債，包括深圳、海南及廣東等地。

為進一步促進發行，我們已將在香港發行的所有內地各級地方人民政府債務票據納入利得稅豁免範圍。這一舉措安排大大提升內地地方政府在港發債的吸引力，進一步鞏固香港在人民幣國際化進程中，作為國家金融開放的「試驗田」角色。

為進一步推動市場開放與互聯互通，我們正在積極與內地監管機構合作，推動一系列措施落地。

例如，我們計劃在香港推出內地政府債券期貨，並研究擴大南向債券通的投資者資格，納入更多非銀行金融機構如證券公司與保險公司。

我們也積極推動「互換通」的深化發展。中國人民銀行、香港證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）與香港金融管理局已於今年五月共同宣布，將延長利率互換合約期限至30年，並推出以貸款市場報價利率（LPR）為基準的新產品，進一步拓展風險管理工具的深度與廣度。

在流動性支持方面，我們亦與人民銀行合作推出人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排，總額度為1,000億人民幣，協助銀行為企業提供跨境人民幣融資服務。此舉將進一步支持實體經濟發展，強化人民幣作為國際貿易與投資貨幣的功能。

各位嘉賓，作為國家的國際金融中心，香港與內地的金融合作正處於加速深化的新階段。我們有信心，透過持續擴大市場聯通、提升人民幣產品流動性、推動資本雙向流動與風險管理工具創新，香港將繼續擔當好「超級聯繫人」與風險緩衝的角色，為國家金融改革開放與高質量發展注入新動能。

我們將繼續以開放、創新、穩健的原則，鞏固香港作為中國與世界之間的資本橋樑，並攜手內地共同推動亞洲以至全球金融市場的可持續發展。謝謝！"

Beware of fraudsters posing as HKMA staff,2025-06-13 18:37,2025-06-13 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061300752.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

âThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has received enquiries from members of the public about fraudsters posing as HKMA senior staff, issuing forged documents falsely claiming that certain securities or investment companies are ""recognised financial institutions"", in an attempt to deceive members of the public into placing funds with these securities companies as a prerequisite for loan approval.

The HKMA wishes to clarify that the above schemes are fraudulent, and the HKMA will not contact individual members of the public regarding personal financial matters.

Should members of the public wish to verify whether an institution is authorized by the HKMA, they should refer to the Register of Authorized Institutions and Local Representative Offices available on the HKMA website.

SFST made positive progress with signing of CDTA with Norway during his visit  (with photos),2025-06-13 18:33,2025-06-13 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061200721.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said during his visit to Oslo, Norway, on June 11 and 12 (Oslo time) that Hong Kong and Norway could create a powerful synergy to address global challenges with regards to climate change and digital transformation, leveraging the complementary strengths of the two places. He was also pleased that after his meeting with the Norwegian Ministry of Finance, positive progress was made with the early signing of a comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreement (CDTA) between Hong Kong and Norway.

Over a meeting with the Norwegian State Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Mr Torgeir Micaelsen, and the Director General of Tax Law Department, Mr Omar G Dajani, on June 12 (Oslo time), Mr Hui urged for an early signing of a CDTA between the two places. Mr Micaelsen responded positively and indicated that they will look into the matter to expedite the process. Mr Hui also told the gathering that Hong Kong had just been confirmed by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation as being among the initial set of jurisdictions having set a target of fully adopting the ISSB Standards. This affirms Hong Kong's efforts and determination in supporting and promoting a common international language in sustainability disclosures.

 To unlock new opportunities in the area of maritime finance, Mr Hui met with the Chief Customer Officer, Ms Line Dahle, and Vice President and Head of Analytics, Mr Sigvald Fossum, of Norwegian marine and energy insurance provider Gard, which has a strong presence in Hong Kong's marine insurance market and provides services to manage maritime risk for clients. He also met with the Vice-President and Director of Group Government and Public Affairs of DNV, Mr Lars Almklov. The global assurance and risk management company DNV has been recognised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority as an approved external reviewer for the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme.

 Mr Hui told management members of the two companies that Hong Kong and Norway possess complementary strengths that can create a compelling case for financial co-operation. While Norway's maritime industry is the cornerstone of its economy, Hong Kong's maritime services industry is also a valued brand in the international arena. Joint ventures in maritime insurance could combine Norway's expertise in marine risk management with Hong Kong's accessibility, creating comprehensive solutions for the sector and addressing the new demands arising from geopolitical and climatic challenges. He highlighted that Hong Kong has a sophisticated ecosystem for ship financing and leasing, supported by tax incentives and its strategic location along global trade routes.

On June 12 (Oslo time), Mr Hui paid a courtesy call to the Chinese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Norway, Ms Hou Yue.

He also had a meeting with the Director of Politics and Society of Finance Norway, Mr Jan Erik Fane, and other management staff. Finance Norway is the industry organisation for the financial sector in Norway, representing banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions on regulatory, policy and industry developments.

 Mr Hui noted that the Norwegian sovereign fund is one of the largest funds in the world and is positioned as a pioneer in responsible investing with a strong emphasis on Environmental, Social and Governance principles. He said that the shared focus of Hong Kong and Norway on sustainability creates significant opportunities for collaboration.
 At a dinner reception co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, London, and the Norway-Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce on June 11 (Oslo time), Mr Hui said that even though there is a geographical distance of around 8 600 kilometres between Norway and Hong Kong, the two places share more commonalities in the financial market than perceived.

 The first one is the commitment to green and sustainable developments. Hong Kong is striving to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, and the Government launched a roadmap last December to require publicly accountable entities (PAEs) to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards) and to provide a well-defined pathway for large PAEs to fully adopt the ISSB Standards no later than 2028.

 Just last week, Hong Kong issued a new round of Government green bonds and infrastructure bonds to channel market capital to support green projects and promote sustainable developments in Hong Kong. This round of bonds amounts to a total of around US$3.5 billion, denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Renminbi, US dollars and euros. The offering attracted participation from a wide spectrum of investors from more than 30 markets across Asia, Europe, Middle East, and the Americas, with total orders amounting to an equivalent of around US$30 billion, representing a subscription ratio of almost nine times.

 The other commonality is expertise in wealth management. Mr Hui noted that Norway's expertise in long-term asset management driven by its sovereign fund aligns seamlessly with Hong Kong's position as Asia's premier wealth management centre. Capitalising on Hong Kong's advantages of having a solid financial infrastructure and an extensive international client base, abundant co-investment opportunities are available for Norwegian capital in the Asian markets, particularly in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

 More commonalities lie in fintech and digital finance. Norway is a highly digitalised economy that has fostered advancements in mobile payment systems, blockchain technology, and digital asset management. At the same time, Hong Kong is home to around 1 100 fintech companies and start-ups. The Government endeavours to boost fintech developments through measures such as enhancing fintech infrastructures, nurturing talent, establishing regulatory regimes for digital assets such as the stablecoin regulatory regime to be enacted on August 1. The second edition of a policy statement on digital assets will also be promulgated soon. By combining Norway's technological innovation with Hong Kong's access to Asian markets, the partnership could drive cutting-edge solutions that redefine digital finance on a global scale.

 Mr Hui has returned to Hong Kong in the evening of June 13."
財庫局局長挪威之行推動簽訂全面性避免雙重課稅協定取得正面進展（附圖）,2025-06-13 18:32,2025-06-13 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/13/P2025061200718.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇六月十一及十二日（奧斯陸時間）出訪挪威奧斯陸時表示，香港與挪威透過互補優勢，可形成強大的協同效應，共同應對氣候變遷和數碼轉型等全球挑戰。他也很高興在與挪威財政部會面後，就盡早簽訂香港與挪威的全面性避免雙重課稅協定取得正面進展。

在六月十二日（奧斯陸時間）與挪威財政部國務秘書Torgeir Micaelsen和稅法司秘書長Omar G Dajani會面時，許正宇促請盡早簽訂兩地之間的全面性避免雙重課稅協定。Torgeir Micaelsen反應正面，並表示會研究加快相關程序。許正宇也提到香港剛獲國際財務報告準則基金會確認為首批以全面採用ISSB準則為目標的司法管轄區，印證香港在支持和推動國際共通可持續披露信息的努力和決心獲得認同。

為拓展海事金融領域的新機遇，許正宇與一家挪威海事及能源保險供應商Gard的客戶服務總監Line Dahle 和副總裁兼市場分析部主管Sigvald Fossum會面。該公司為客戶提供海事風險管理服務，佔有香港海事保險市場相當的份額。許正宇也與全球審計及風險管理公司DNV的副總裁兼集團政府及公共事務通訊總監Lars Almklov見面。該公司為香港金融管理局「綠色和可持續金融資助計劃」的認可外部評審機構。

許正宇向兩家公司的管理人員表示，香港和挪威擁有互補優勢，在金融領域的合作空間極具潛力。挪威的航運業是其經濟基石，而香港的航運服務業在國際舞台上亦是「金漆招牌」。合營航運保險可以將挪威在航運風險管理方面的專業知識與香港的通達性相結合，為航運業打造全面的解決方案的同時，也能照顧地緣政治和氣候挑戰帶來的新需求。他特別提到，香港擁有完善的船舶融資和租賃生態圈，還有稅務優惠和位處全球貿易航線戰略要地的優勢。

許正宇於六月十二日（奧斯陸時間）禮節性拜會了中國駐挪威王國特命全權大使侯悅。

他亦與挪威金融協會政治及社會事務總監Jan Erik Fane及該協會管理人員會面。該協會是挪威金融業的業界組織，就監管、政策和產業發展代表銀行、保險公司和其他金融機構發聲。

許正宇提到，挪威主權基金是全球最大的基金之一，是負責任投資的先驅，高度重視環境、社會和管治原則。他表示，香港與挪威同樣關注可持續發展，為兩地合作創造無限機遇。

許正宇六月十一日（奧斯陸時間）在香港駐倫敦經濟貿易辦事處與挪威香港商會聯合舉辦的晚宴上致辭時表示，挪威與香港雖然在地理上相距約八千六百公里，但兩地在金融市場的共同點卻比意想中多。

首先是兩地對綠色和可持續發展的承諾。香港致力在二○五○年前達致碳中和，政府並在去年十二月推出路線圖，要求公眾責任實體採用國際財務報告可持續披露準則（ISSB準則）的方針，並就不遲於二○二八年大型公眾責任實體全面採用ISSB準則提供清晰的路徑。

上週，香港發行新一輪政府綠色債券及基礎建設債券，以引導巿場資金支持綠色項目和推動香港的可持續發展。此輪基金發行總額約35億美元，以港元、人民幣、美元和歐元計價。是次發行吸引了來自亞洲、歐洲、中東和美洲逾30多個市場的環球投資者廣泛參與，錄得總認購金額約300億美元等值，認購額差不多達發行額的九倍。

另一個共同點是財富管理的優勢。許正宇指出，挪威以其主權基金為主導，在長期資產管理方面有深厚經驗，與香港作為亞洲首要財富管理中心的地位完美契合。憑藉香港穩固的金融基礎設施和廣泛的國際客戶群，挪威資本在亞洲市場，尤其是粵港澳大灣區，可享有龐大的共同投資機會。

金融科技和數碼金融領域也是兩地有共同點之處。挪威是一個高度數碼化的經濟體，一直大力推動行動支付系統、區塊鏈技術和數碼資產管理。與此同時，香港擁有約1100家金融科技公司和初創企業。政府致力促進金融科技發展，推出不同措施去強化金融科技基礎設施、培養人才、建立數碼資產監管制度等，其中八月一日便會實施穩定幣監管制度，而第二份數碼資產政策宣言亦發布在即。透過結合挪威的科技創新與經香港進入亞洲市場的便利性，兩地合作可望推動尖端解決方案，為全球重新定義數碼金融。

許正宇六月十三日傍晚已返抵香港。"
