Mr Lee said he is pleased to meet Mr Sam again following Mr Sam's earlier visit to Hong Kong. He said that establishing the Guangdong-Macao In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin demonstrates the key strategic planning to enrich the practice of ""one country, two systems"", benefitting Macao's long-term prosperity and stability and integration into the overall national development. Noting that Hong Kong and Macao are the country's special administrative regions that enjoy distinctive advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Mr Lee said that the two cities enjoy close geographical ties, with frequent people-to-people and cultural exchanges, alongside solid economic and trade relations, while Hong Kong and Macao have been working closely in such areas as economy, cross-boundary infrastructure, tourism and culture.

Mr Lee pointed out that Hong Kong and Macao are both integral parts of the GBA and will continue to promote the development of the GBA together. By firmly upholding the principle of ""one country"" and leveraging the benefits of ""two systems"", Hong Kong and Macao will achieve complementarity and jointly seize development opportunities, and continue to strengthen co-operation between the two cities, contributing to the promotion of the high-quality development of the GBA.

Government departments drive all-out efforts to cope with rainstorm impacts,2025-08-05 18:22,2025-08-05 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500853.htm,"A Government spokesman said today (August 5) that the persistent rainstorm has caused flooding and landslides across extensive areas of Hong Kong. Relevant government departments have responded promptly, making every effort to minimise the impacts of the heavy rain.

Since late last night (August 4), the Government's Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre has been operating continuously, with directorate officers from relevant departments closely monitoring the situation across Hong Kong in real time. They have been swiftly co-ordinating responses and actions, remaining on high alert and efficiently orchestrating all government departments to fully mobilise in addressing flooding, landslides, fallen trees, and road blockages, striving to minimise the impact of adverse weather on the public.

The Drainage Services Department (DSD) has been maintaining close liaison with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and making preparations. The DSD activated the Emergency Control Centre at 10.35pm last night and deployed emergency response teams to proactively inspect flooding-prone locations, including Chai Wan and Wong Tai Sin. Various locations experienced flooding due to the heavy rainfall. The DSD mobilised a total of 180 emergency response teams, involving about 620 personnel and several powerful pumping robots, including three Mobile Powerful Pumping Robots, and worked closely with other works departments to handle flooding cases and clear drainage channels across the territory. As of 3pm today, 29 flooding cases have been confirmed, with 24 of them resolved, including the case at Queen Mary Hospital. The affected roads have mostly resumed normal operation. The DSD emergency response teams are working at full capacity to handle the remaining flooding cases.

The Emergency Control Centre of the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) was activated soon after the HKO issued a landslip warning. As of 2.30pm today, a total of 15 reports of landslides were received in areas including Sai Kung, Tai Po, Kwai Chung, Lantau, Southern, Mid-levels, Wan Chai, Sha Tin and Peng Chau. The GEO has arranged inspections of the reported landslide locations and contacted relevant departments for necessary emergency slope works.

During rainstorm warnings, the Fire Services Department, by 4pm today, handled a total of 42 reports of people trapped in lifts, 175 reports from automatic fire alarm systems, 36 reports of fallen trees, seven reports of landslides, and 69 reports of flooding incidents. Among these, assistance was provided to six people to safe places in two of the flooding incidents.

The Urban and New Territories Emergency Control Centres of the Highways Department were activated after the Red Rainstorm Warning Signal was in force last night to co-ordinate the handling of road emergencies, including clearing debris at road sections in Southern District, Tai Po and Sai Kung where landslides occurred, with the goal of reopening at least one traffic lane for public use as soon as possible while continuing to follow up urgent slope repair works; and quickly clearing roadside gullies blocked by muddy water and debris in various districts where flooding occurred, with affected road sections reopened immediately afterwards.

The Emergency Transport Coordination Centre (ETCC) of the Transport Department (TD) continues to operate round the clock and escalated its operational level when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is in force to closely monitor the traffic and transport conditions of important routes including trunk roads, tunnels and bridges across the territory. The ETCC expedites assessment of the impact of the rainstorm on traffic and maintains close liaison with relevant departments and public transport operators to steer and co-ordinate public transport services to meet passenger demand.

The TD conducts ongoing review of various trunk roads and link roads in locations without alternatives, aiming to promptly identify locations affected by flooding or obstructed by objects requiring higher priority clearance. This facilitates the clearance work of departments concerned, with a view to reopening blocked roads and resuming public transport services, thereby minimising impact on the public's commute.

During the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, frontline police officers remained steadfast in assisting members of the public affected by the heavy rain across multiple districts. They also handled vehicles stranded due to flooding and cleared blocked drains in rural areas to ensure smooth traffic flow.

The Government urges members of the public to stay away from slopes as the landslip warning is still in force. Drivers should avoid driving in hilly areas or parking their vehicles below slopes. Residents living close to slopes should stay in rooms furthest from the slopes or on high floors if possible. When a notification to evacuate is received, members of the public should follow rescuers' instructions and move immediately to a safe shelter. If they witness a landslide, they should leave immediately and call the Police when safe to do so.

The Home Affairs Department (HAD) has so far opened a total of 15 temporary shelters for people in need. The Emergency Co-ordination Centre of the HAD has been in operation since the early hours to co-ordinate work and information dissemination in 18 districts as well as prompt follow-up on various incident reports. District Offices have immediately initiated relevant response measures, including co-ordinating with other departments and organisations to provide support. They have also mobilised District Council members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to pay attention to safety.

The Housing Department (HD) Communication Centre was promptly activated to handle emergencies after the Red Rainstorm Warning Signal was in force. As of 4pm, the Centre received 49 enquiries from residents, which were immediately relayed to relevant teams for follow-up to provide swift assistance. This included a case of temporary power failure in a block of Kwai Shing West Estate, where power supply has since been resumed after emergency repair. Frontline staff of the HD also remained dedicated to their duties, taking precautionary measures against the heavy rain and stepping up patrols. The overall operation of housing estate facilities remained unaffected. The HD will continue to work with other departments to ensure the safety of public housing residents.

Hong Kong's weather conditions remain unstable. The Government reminds the public to stay updated on the latest weather and traffic reports. Government departments will continue to make every effort to carry out coping measures and relief work, while Care Teams will provide ongoing support to members of the public in need."

A male passenger, aged 20, arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds concealed inside vacuum-sealed bags in his check-in suitcase. He was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (August 6).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

醫院管理局（醫管局）宣布，轄下的普通科門診診所夜間門診服務會於黑色暴雨警告信號取消後的兩小時內陸續恢復服務。

早前已在普通科門診診所、專科門診診所、專職醫療及其他日間服務預約覆診日期的慢性疾病或專科門診病人，如因暴雨影響而未能應診，請依照覆診紙上的指示處理預約安排。至於經電話預約系統或手機應用程式「HA Go」預約普通科門診的病人，請於黑色暴雨警告信號取消一小時後，重新預約診症。

醫管局發言人說：「部分病人受惡劣天氣影響未能應診，預計未來幾日求診的病人數目會增加。醫管局已採取不同措施加強人手及服務，以應付需求，會盡量為有需要的病人提供協助。」"
衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案,2025-08-05 17:30,2025-08-05 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500709.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月五日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱個案，屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。除基孔肯雅熱外，市民亦需提防登革熱，兩者同樣可由本地普遍存在的白紋伊蚊傳播。今年登革熱持續在眾多鄰近旅遊地點流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已分別錄得超過20 000宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過3 000宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得308宗本地感染病例。

 市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）已加強確診病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪地點的防蚊滅蚊工作。同時，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

各監察地區最新的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器及密度指數，可參考以下網址：www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Ovitrap_Index_Update.html#。

中心聯同食環署會於今日晚上八時至八時半在Facebook專頁舉行網上直播講座，講解有關預防蚊叮及控制蚊患的資訊及健康建議，並回應市民的相關查詢。歡迎市民參與。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。

Hospital Authority resumes service arrangements,2025-08-05 17:30,2025-08-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500734.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) announced that its general out-patient clinics (GOPCs) will resume evening services gradually within two hours after the cancellation of the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal.

  Chronic illness or specialist out-patient clinic patients who have scheduled appointments at GOPCs, specialist out-patient clinics, allied health or other day services can follow the instructions listed on the appointment slips for the arrangements if their appointments are affected by the rainstorm. Patients who booked their GOPC appointments via the telephone system or the mobile app ""HA Go"" can make a new appointment one hour after the cancellation of the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal.

  The HA spokesman said, ""Due to the bad weather, some patients were unable to attend their consultations. It is anticipated that the number of patients will increase in the coming few days. The HA has adopted different measures to enhance its manpower and service capacity to cope with the demand and to render assistance to patients in need."""
CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today,2025-08-05 17:30,2025-08-05 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500708.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 5) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF case. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of one CF case has been recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Apart from CF, members of the public should also stay vigilant against dengue fever (DF), as both can be transmitted by the Aedes albopictus, which is ubiquitous in Hong Kong. DF continues to be prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations this year. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases. Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 308 locally infected cases so far this year.

If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has intensified anti-mosquito measures at the residence of the confirmed patient and the locations visited after the onset of illness. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces as well as removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The latest gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas are available on the department website at:www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Ovitrap_Index_Update.html#.

The CHP will collaborate with the FEHD to hold an online live seminar on itsFacebook pagetonight from 8pm to 8.30pm, to provide information and health advice on preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquito breeding, as well as addressing related public enquiries. Members of the public are welcome to attend.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

​政府各部門全力應對暴雨對本港造成的影響,2025-08-05 17:16,2025-08-05 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500721.htm,"政府發言人今日（八月五日）表示，本港廣泛地區持續受到暴雨影響，多區出現水浸及山泥傾瀉，各相關部門迅速應對，全力將暴雨影響減至最低。

自昨晚（八月四日）深夜起，政府的緊急事故監察及支援中心一直持續運作，由各相關部門的首長級人員實時密切監察全港市面的情況，迅速作出協調應變及行動，嚴陣以待並高效統籌協調各政府部門全力出動，處理水浸、山泥傾瀉、塌樹和道路阻塞等情況，致力減低惡劣天氣對市民的影響。

渠務署一直與天文台保持密切聯繫並作好準備，於昨晚十時三十五分啓動緊急事故控制中心，並派出緊急應變隊伍主動巡查過去容易水浸的地點，包括柴灣及黃大仙。由於持續暴雨，多個地方出現水浸，渠務署共派出180隊緊急應變隊伍，動用約620人及多部強力排水機械人，包括三部「龍吸水」，與其他政府工務部門緊密合作，在全港各區處理水浸個案及清理渠道。至今日下午三時，已確認29個水浸個案，並完成處理其中24個個案及清除水浸，當中包括瑪麗醫院的水浸個案，受水浸影響的道路亦得以大致回復正常運作。渠務署緊急應變隊伍正全力處理餘下地點的水浸個案。

土力工程處亦於天文台發出山泥傾瀉警告後，迅速啓動緊急控制中心。截至今日下午二時三十分，土力工程處接獲共15宗位於西貢、大埔、葵涌、大嶼山、南區、半山、灣仔、沙田及坪洲等地區的山泥傾瀉報告；已安排人員視察山泥傾瀉事故地點，並已聯絡相關部門安排所需的斜坡緊急工程。

在暴雨警告信號期間，消防處截至今日下午四時共處理了42宗有人被困升降機報告、175宗自動報火警系統報告、36宗樹木倒塌報告、七宗山泥傾瀉報告，以及69宗水浸事故報告；在其中兩宗水浸事故共協助了六名市民到安全地方。

路政署轄下的市區和新界緊急控制中心在昨晚紅色暴雨警告信號生效後啓動，協調處理緊急道路事故的工作，包括在南區、大埔和西貢等發生山泥傾瀉的路段清理山泥，以盡快開通最少一條行車線予公眾使用，並繼續跟進斜坡緊急復修工作；以及在各區出現水浸的路段，迅速清理受泥水和雜物造成淤塞的路旁集水溝後，即時重開受影響路段。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間繼續24小時運作，並提升級別，密切監察全港各區主要幹道、隧道和橋樑等重要道路的交通及運輸情況。協調中心加快評估暴雨對交通造成的影響，並與相關部門和公共運輸服務營辦商緊密溝通，督導和協調公共運輸服務，應對乘客需求。署方持續檢視各主要幹道及沒有替代路線地點的連接道路清單，務求快捷分辨出須優先清理水浸和路面障礙物的位置，便利相關部門執行清理工作，盡快開通阻塞道路，盡早全面恢復公交服務，將對市民出行的影響減至最低。

在黑色暴雨警告信號生效期間，前線警務人員堅守崗位，在多區協助受暴雨影響的居民，處理因水浸被困的車輛和清理鄉郊淤塞的渠口，疏導交通。

政府呼籲市民，山泥傾瀉警告現時仍然生效，市民應遠離斜坡；駕駛人士亦應避免駛經山區或在斜坡下停泊車輛。居住在靠近斜坡地方的市民，應盡量留在遠離斜坡的房間，並盡量逗留在較高的樓層。如市民收到通知需要疏散，應配合救援人員的指示，即時撤離到安全地方暫避。如市民發現所處地點附近發生山泥傾瀉，應立即離開，並在安全的情況下報警。

此外，民政事務總署至現時合共開放了15個臨時庇護中心，供有需要市民入住。民政事務總署緊急事故協調中心已由凌晨時分開始運作，協調各區工作及傳遞信息，迅速跟進各項緊急事故報告。各區民政事務處亦已啓動相關應對工作，包括協調其他部門和機構作出支援，並動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新的天氣資訊，提醒他們注意安全。

房屋署聯絡中心於紅色暴雨警告信號發出後迅速啓動，處理突發事故。截至今日下午四時，聯絡中心收到49宗住戶查詢，已即時通知相關組別跟進處理，迅速提供協助。其中葵盛西邨一座大廈短暫停電的個案，經搶修後現時電力供應已恢復。房屋署前線同事亦緊守崗位，作出應對暴雨防範措施，加強巡查，各屋邨設施整體運作未受影響。房屋署會繼續與各部門協作，保障公共屋邨居民的安全。

現時本港天氣仍然不穩定，政府提醒市民留意最新天氣消息及交通情況報告。政府各部門人員會繼續全力進行應對及善後工作，而關愛隊亦會繼續向有需要市民提供支援。"

CHP appeals for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions,2025-08-05 12:08,2025-08-05 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500502.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 5) appealed to members of the public for heightened vigilance against melioidosis infection following adverse weather conditions and urged them to maintain personal and environmental hygiene. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

  Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Burkholderia pseudomallei is widespread in soil and muddy water, particularly common in moist clay soil. Humans can become infected through contact with contaminated soil and surface water (especially through skin abrasions/wounds); inhalation of contaminated dust/water droplets; and ingestion of contaminated water. Those with underlying diseases or immunosuppression have higher risks of contracting the disease.

According to overseas literature and local data, Burkholderia pseudomallei in the soil and muddy water may be exposed to the ground after typhoons or storms, and the bacteria would spread more easily with strong wind and storms. As such, infection cases are more common after typhoons or storms.

In view of the recent disturbance caused by typhoon andconsecutive days of torrential rain, the CHP again reminded members of the public, in particular high-risk groups such as those with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water as far as practicable, to prevent melioidosis infection.

Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong and human infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. As of yesterday (August 4), eight melioidosis infection cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded. In light of the cluster of melioidosis cases recorded in Sham Shui Po in 2022, the CHP and the Water Supplies Department have implemented a series of precautionary and monitoring measures, including the installation of high efficiency particulate air filters at the ventilators of all fresh water service reservoirs in Hong Kong, enhancing residual chlorine levels in drinking water, continual monitoring of residual chlorine level of fresh water in service reservoirs and consumers' taps, as well as health education and surveillance of infection cases. No abnormalities were detected from all surveillance results so far, including those conducted after typhoons and heavy rain, while the drinking water quality monitoring results have consistently been in compliance with the Hong Kong Drinking Water Standards.

A spokesman for the CHP explained that person-to-person transmission andanimal-to-human transmission are rare but may occur through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Melioidosis may present with localised infection (such as cutaneous abscess), pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, sepsis, or chronic suppurative infection. Depending on the site of infection, common symptoms of melioidosis include fever, headache, localised pain or swelling, ulceration, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, and swelling of regional lymph nodes. The CHP appealed again to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromised conditions, in order to receive appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

The CHP reminded members of the public to take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. usinggloves and wearing boots;
If exposure to contaminated water or soil is inevitable, high-risk individuals should wear a mask, gloves and boots;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soilor gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

衞生防護中心呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺預防類鼻疽感染,2025-08-05 12:08,2025-08-05 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/05/P2025080500500.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（八月五日）呼籲市民在惡劣天氣下提高警覺，保持個人及環境衞生，預防感染類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

類鼻疽是一種由類鼻疽伯克氏菌引致的疾病。類鼻疽伯克氏菌廣泛存在於土壤和泥水中，特別是濕潤的黏土。人類可能通過接觸受污染的土壤和水源（尤其是經皮膚損傷／傷口）、吸入受污染的微塵／水滴和飲用受污染的水而受到感染。長期病患者及免疫力弱人士有較大機會受感染。

根據海外文獻和本地數據，在颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令類鼻疽病菌更容易散播，令感染個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。

因應近期本港受颱風以及連日暴雨影響，中心發言人再次提醒市民，特別是高風險群組例如長期病患者，盡量避免接觸土壤或泥水，以免受類鼻疽病菌感染。

類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得人類感染類鼻疽個案。截至昨日（八月四日），本港今年錄得八宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。 因應二○二二年深水埗出現的類鼻疽群組個案，中心及水務署已採取一系列的預防及監察措施，包括在全港所有配水庫的通風口加裝高效能空氣過濾網、加強食水的餘氯含量、持續監測配水庫及用戶水龍頭食水的餘氯含量，並加強健康教育和監測感染個案。至今包括於颱風及暴雨後所進行的監測結果未有出現異常情況，而食水水質監測的結果亦一直符合香港食水標準。

中心發言人解釋，類鼻疽病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可以透過接觸患者的血液或體液而傳播。類鼻疽的病人可出現局部感染（例如皮膚膿腫）、肺炎、腦膜腦炎、敗血症或長期化膿性感染。視乎感染的部位，類鼻疽常見的病徵包括發燒、頭痛、局部痛楚或腫脹、潰瘍、胸痛、咳嗽、咳血及局部淋巴結腫大。中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。

中心再次提醒市民應採取以下措施預防感染：

避免接觸受污染的土壤；
進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿著適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴；
高風險人士如不能避免接觸受污染的水或土壤，應佩戴口罩和手套，並穿上水靴
接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。
