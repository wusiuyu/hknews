商經局局長在格魯吉亞出席第比利斯絲綢之路國際論壇（附圖）,2025-10-22 20:35,2025-10-22 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200598.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺由土耳其轉抵格魯吉亞第比利斯，於十月二十二日（第比利斯時間）出席第五屆第比利斯絲綢之路國際論壇。

論壇匯聚逾2 000名來自超過60國的代表，包括國家元首、部長、全球行政總裁及國際組織和思想領袖，旨在加強東西方合作，並就區域和全球聯通面對的挑戰提出可行方案。

在題為「重塑全球貿易」的專題討論環節上，丘應樺向與會者分享香港以多管齊下的策略，在當前地緣政治急劇變化，以及保護主義、單邊主義和供應鏈重整正重塑全球貿易流向之際，克服挑戰和把握新機遇。

他表示，香港廣闊的自由貿易協定（自貿協定）及經濟夥伴網絡，對減緩地緣政治對貿易的影響發揮關鍵作用。香港至今已與21個經濟體簽署九份自貿協定，其中包括14個「一帶一路」國家，並與33個經濟體簽訂24份促進和保護投資協定。他指出，自香港與格魯吉亞簽署的自貿協定於二○一九年生效以來，兩地雙邊商品貿易穩步增長，二○一九年至二○二四年間的年均增長率達8.7%。

丘應樺指，除了全球貿易體制轉變，監管制度碎片化和物流瓶頸亦對貿易流動構成窒礙。他表示，香港一直致力優化清關程序以便利貿易，並正推出「貿易單一窗口」，把貿易文件提交方式電子化。

談到數字化，丘應樺強調，穩健且完善的數字基礎設施框架對迎接轉型亦至關重要，香港一直積極推動企業及貿易的數字化改革。其中，香港持續推動國際社會參與有關數字經濟發展的討論，並在雙邊貿易協定談判中探討在協定內加入相關條文，以促進數字貿易和跨境電商的發展。

除了出席論壇，丘應樺亦藉今次格魯吉亞之行與當地商界會面，推廣香港優越的營商環境。

丘應樺與當地葡萄酒業界舉行商業圓桌會議，介紹香港作為葡萄酒及烈酒貿易樞紐的優勢，以及透過引進雙層烈酒稅制調低烈酒稅，促進高價值烈酒貿易和拍賣。雙方亦就探討兩地在葡萄酒和烈酒推廣方面進一步合作交換意見，讓格魯吉亞酒商利用香港作為平台，開拓中國內地市場。

丘應樺亦與格魯吉亞工商會的代表會面，向他們介紹香港的最新發展及各項吸引投資和推動經濟發展的措施，包括北部都會區發展，以及成立內地企業出海專班以協助內地企業拓展海外業務。他強調香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的獨特角色，並鼓勵格魯吉亞企業透過香港，把握「一帶一路」倡議和粵港澳大灣區帶來的龐大商機。

丘應樺在十月二十一日（第比利斯時間）抵達第比利斯後，隨即出席論壇歡迎酒會，期間與中華人民共和國駐格魯吉亞特命全權大使周謙交流，簡介香港的最新經貿發展，並了解格魯吉亞的社會及經濟狀況。

丘應樺將於十月二十三日（第比利斯時間）轉赴北京，參與由財政司司長陳茂波率領的代表團進行訪問。"
SCED attends Tbilisi Silk Road Forum in Georgia (with photos),2025-10-22 20:35,2025-10-22 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200599.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, proceeded to Tbilisi, Georgia, from Türkiye to attend the 5th Tbilisi Silk Road Forum on October 22 (Tbilisi time).

 The Forum brought together over 2 000 delegates from more than 60 countries, including heads of state, ministers and global chief executive officers, as well as international organisation and thought leaders to strengthen East-West co-operation and foster practical solutions for regional and global connectivity challenges.

 At a panel session entitled ""Rewiring global trade"", Mr Yau shared with participants Hong Kong's multifaceted approach to overcome challenges and leverage new opportunities when the world is undergoing profound geopolitical shifts, with protectionism, unilateralism and supply chain realignments reshaping the global trade flows.

 He said that Hong Kong's extensive network of free trade agreements (FTAs) and economic partnerships has been instrumental in mitigating the geopolitical impacts on trade. So far Hong Kong has signed nine FTAs with 21 economies, including 14 Belt and Road countries, and 24 investment promotion and protection agreements with 33 economies. He highlighted that since the FTA signed between Hong Kong and Georgia entered into force in 2019, there has been a steady growth in bilateral merchandise trade between the two places, with an average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent recorded between 2019 and 2024.

 Mr Yau noted that apart from changes in the global trade regime, regulatory fragmentation and logistical bottlenecks also obstruct trade flows. He said that Hong Kong has always strived to facilitate trade by improving customs clearance procedures and is also launching the Trade Single Window to digitalise the submission of trade documents.

 Turning to digitalisation, Mr Yau stressed that a robust and well-established framework for digital infrastructure is also essential for embracing transformation. Over the past years, Hong Kong has been actively advancing reforms in the digitalisation of enterprises and trade. He added that specifically, Hong Kong has been fostering international community participation in discussions on the development of the digital economy and exploring the inclusion of relevant provisions in bilateral trade agreements during negotiations, aiming to promote digital trade and cross-border e-commerce.

 In addition to attending the Forum, Mr Yau also took the opportunity to meet with Georgia's business sector to promote Hong Kong's favourable business environment during his visit to the country.

 Mr Yau held a business roundtable with local wine practitioners to brief them on Hong Kong's advantages as a wine and liquor trading hub, and the city's reduction of liquor duty by introducing a two-tier liquor duty system to encourage the trade and auctions of high-end liquor. They also exchanged views on exploring further collaboration between the two places on wine and liquor promotion, using Hong Kong as a platform for Georgian wine merchants to tap into the Chinese Mainland market.

 Mr Yau also met with representatives of the Georgian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to brief them on Hong Kong's latest developments and various initiatives to attract investment and drive economic developments, such as the Northern Metropolis development and the setting up of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global to assist Mainland enterprises in expanding business overseas. He highlighted Hong Kong's unique role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" and encouraged Georgian enterprises to grasp the vast business opportunities brought about by the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area via Hong Kong.

 Upon arrival in Tbilisi on October 21 (Tbilisi time), Mr Yau attended the welcome reception of the Forum during which he had exchanges with the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to Georgia, Mr Zhou Qian, to give him an update on the latest economic and trade developments of Hong Kong and learn more about the social and economic situation of Georgia.

 Mr Yau will proceed to Beijing on October 23 (Tbilisi time) to join a delegation to be led by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, for a visit."
連續三日錄得兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案  衞生署呼籲學校按照「預防傳染病指引」執行防控措施和處理爆發個案,2025-10-22 20:30,2025-10-22 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200768.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月二十二日）再接獲一宗嚴重個案，是本周第三宗。鑑於學校流感爆發個案處於高水平，中心再次去信全港學校，敦促校方按照「預防傳染病指引」執行防控措施和處理爆發個案，同時呼籲學校盡早完成疫苗接種活動，會繼續積極提供可行協助。

最新嚴重個案涉及一名過往健康良好的11歲女童。她十月十九日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和喉嚨痛，十月二十一日到仁濟醫院急症室求醫，其後被轉送瑪嘉烈醫院留院治理，目前情況嚴重。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎。女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，她就讀的學校近日有另外十名不同班別的學生感染流感，十人均病況輕微，無需留院。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港現時正處於夏季流感季節，今季與流感相關的嚴重或死亡個案和以往一樣，主要影響『一老一幼』。然而，對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童尤其受到影響，嚴重個案亦較多。計及今日的最新一宗個案，由九月開學至今，有十三宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎2至17歲，其中十人過往的健康狀況良好。學校爆發方面，開學至今共有602宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（64宗）、小學（320宗）及中學（218宗），呈報數目遠高於今年初整個冬季流感季節錄得的88宗。」

中心除了繼續全力協助學校安排疫苗接種活動外，今日亦再次去信學校，提醒學校加強防控措施，包括使用正確方法有效清潔消毒校園、適當開啓窗戶以改善校宿的空氣流通情況、提醒師生時刻注意個人及手部衞生。中心亦建議師生每天返校前檢查體溫，如出現病徵或發燒，不應回校上學。若懷疑出現爆發個案（如呼吸道感染），學校應立即呈報，以便中心跟進。

徐樂堅醫生提醒家長，兒童患上流感後，情況有機會迅速惡化。家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。高危人士方面，如果到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

季節性流感疫苗接種計劃方面，為提高接種率，中心今年已提早於六月初開始接受學校報名參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃。在政府和社會各界（包括醫療界和學校等）的共同努力下，目前已有約2 300間學校（總數的99%）會舉行流感疫苗學校外展活動，當中超過1 330間學校（58%）會於本月底或之前進行外展活動，而約2 170間學校（94%）則會於下月（十一月）底或之前進行，分別較去年的45%和83%為高。

徐樂堅醫生補充：「在學校和醫療機構的通力合作下，學校外展活動普遍將早於上一季度完成。開學至今，已有約710間學校已舉行季節性流感疫苗學校外展外展活動，較上一季度同期約560間為高。另外，有23間學校近日已應中心呼籲，將原訂於今年十二月或明年一月舉行疫苗接種活動學校，提前至下月底前舉行疫苗接種活動。我們明白參與計劃的學校在安排外展活動時，需考慮校曆、人手安排等不同客觀因素，與參與計劃的醫療團隊協商合適的時間進行。倘若學校有意提前外展活動而遇有任何困難，可於辦公時間內致電中心（電話：3975 4872），我們會全力提供協助。」

目前，季節性流感疫苗接種計劃下各個計劃已接種超過77萬劑疫苗，接種率較去年增加約5.2%，但6個月至2歲以下兒童的接種率仍然相對偏低。

徐樂堅醫生表示，政府開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間家庭醫學診所和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

更多有關季節性流感疫苗接種計劃的資料，可瀏覽疫苗接種計劃專頁或於辦公時間內致電衞生防護中心（電話：2125 2125）查詢。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-22 19:56,2025-10-22 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200729.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 22), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a cumulative total of 42 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. Among them, a 77-year-old male patient with chronic illnesses previously announced has passed away today after his condition deteriorated. He returned to Hong Kong on October 13 from the Chinese Mainland and developed a fever and joint pain on the same day. He developed a rash on October 14 and sought medical attention at a private hospital where he was admitted for treatment. His condition subsequently deteriorated, leading to his transfer to the intensive care unit of Ruttonjee Hospital. The clinical diagnosis was CF complicated with multi-organ failure.

  Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in a thousand. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under one-year-old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
立法會：署理發展局局長就「改革滲水問題處理機制」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-10-22 19:48,2025-10-22 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200723.htm,"以下是署理發展局局長林智文今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上就陳恒鑌議員動議的「改革滲水問題處理機制」議案的總結發言：

主席：

我再次感謝提出議案的陳恒鑌議員，以及其他多位議員剛才的發言。大家表達的意見將會是令我們的工作做得更好的寶貴參考。不過剛才提到有幾個範疇可能都跟屋宇署在技術支援方面有較大關係，我也想在此作扼要回應，主要是關於程序所需時間、我們利用的科技、現時的外判制度、工程上的監管或者如何尋找合適人士進行工程，以及一些給予業主的支援。

跟進滲水個案機制

剛才有議員指出，其實滲水的原因有很多，可以是污水、食水或雨水。現在滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處（聯辦處）的結構是食物環境衞生署（食環署）加上屋宇署，可聯同其他不同部門，就着不同的個案有不同的工具及法例去處理，譬如我們可以引用《公眾衞生及市政條例》、《建築物條例》或者《水務設施條例》。其實這樣正正可以針對不同情況作出有效處理。所以如果說所需時間長，是否因為目前聯辦處的結構呢？就着加快處理個案，其實我們在程序優化方面着手，可能更加有效處理這個問題。所以為了加快程序，今年的《施政報告》都提到一些將程序優化的措施。我舉一個例子，譬如以往第一、第二階段由食環署去做，之後由屋宇署做第三階段檢查。一般來說，我們現在需要90個工作天完成，所以，現在屋宇署會提早做第三階段，可以將時間縮短大概三分之一至64個工作天。這正是利用程序優化令速度提速。當然我們亦已做了一些工作加快處理，譬如剛才提到食水方面，如果滴水情況嚴重，即是在表面也看到是食水喉滲漏，聯辦處會馬上將個案交予水務署處理，這亦加快了處理速度。

檢測技術

第二，就是技術方面。剛才我在開場發言已提及，現時我們在第一階段已經會盡量使用輕便的紅外線去加快，另外在第二及第三階段，在技術可行的情況下，我們都會使用一些新科技，包括微波斷層掃描和紅外線熱成像分析。當然，在有些情況會有限制，譬如有假天花或者飾面，我們當然未必可以使用，但在可行情況下我們會盡量使用。使用了這些新科技不單更加準確、更加快捷，其實可能對整個流程的速度都有幫助。舉個例子，我們用傳統色水，可能要到樓上單位做測試，如果用微波斷層掃描，其實我們在樓下受滲水困擾的單位已經作出判斷，整個檢測過程會更流暢，亦有加速作用。當然，屋宇署會持續留意各地檢測技術發展，會不停考慮如何引入一些適合香港的新技術，希望可以令我們更加快、更加準確和快捷地處理滲水問題。

外判顧問公司的監管制度

剛才提到屋宇署的外判公司制度會否有花紅制度。外判公司受政府委託後必須要做好其工作本份。其實，我們都有監察制度，做得好的公司，我們都有獎勵。我們每次聘請顧問或者聘用相關服務都會看其以往工作表現。好的工作表現紀錄對它將來投標政府顧問合約會有幫助。所以我剛才說過，現有監察機制包括工作會議、周年報告，甚至是評核報告。如果表現欠佳，我們會發出提示、預警信、警告信及給予負評報告，希望可以糾正。如果同一個顧問在同一個合約內連續接多過一份表現欠佳報告，我們還可以禁止它投標屋宇署的顧問合約三至十二個月。另外，我們每次考慮新的招標時，相關顧問公司在過去三年的所有合約評核都會影響他們投標新顧問合約的評分，以及成功投得合約的機會。所以，我們事實上都有獎罰機制，鼓勵顧問做得好，亦防止他們做得不好。當然，我需要指出，調查滲水進度其實受制於很多因素，亦有其複雜性，可能多於一個滲水源頭，或者滲水的情況特別，有重覆或有間段，以及業主是否合作，所以有些範疇並非全屬顧問公司可以控制的範疇。所以我們利用監察制度，每一個個案去看它是否真的盡力去做，會更加準確反映和公平反映該顧問公司的表現。

防水工程註冊制度

另外，剛才提到市民如何得知找哪些人進行防水工程，以及工程是否有監管。其實，我們一直有就工程進行監管，其中一個重要合作夥伴——建造業議會，有個「註冊專門行業承造商制度」（制度）就不同工種作規管和註冊。當中亦包括防水層及防水工程的相關工種，已納入分包商名冊，現時已有約300家註冊公司，這些資訊讓大家知悉名冊上有甚麼公司做防水及防水層工程。為了更能協助市民和業主，屋宇署現時正與業界人士商討，探討提供一份有意提供這類防水工程的人士和參考價格的資料，上載到一個資料庫，令市民和業主有需要時更容易找到參考。

向業主提供財政支援

雖然業主是負責樓宇維修和處理滲水的主要責任人，但政府亦會提供支援。正如我剛才在開場發言提到，市區重建局就有需要業主的資助計劃，或者屋宇署就樓宇安全的貸款計劃，均是在財政上為有需要的業主提供援助，令他們能加快做好處理樓宇方面的問題，包括滲水問題。這些都是政府會提出的支援。

總結

總結來說，有效解決滲水問題需要凝聚社會共識，以及大家努力。秉持本屆政府做實事、做成事的決心，發展局及屋宇署會全力協助推動落實《施政報告》宣布的處理樓宇滲水問題的優化程序，為香港居民創造一個更美好的居住環境。

我謹此陳辭。多謝。"
立法會十二題：精神健康的支援,2025-10-22 19:42,2025-10-22 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200584.htm,"  以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上梁毓偉議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見認為，近年來學業、家庭及人際關係等壓力，加上不斷改變的社會環境，令青年出現精神健康的問題越來越普遍。據報有研究更指出，在15歲至24歲人口中，有多達16.6%的受訪者出現精神健康問題，但他們大多並未尋求協助。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年公營醫院的精神科專科門診的兒童及青年新症及覆診個案數目，以及佔整體個案數目的百分比分別為何，並按涉及青少年的年齡組別（即六歲以下、六歲至12歲以下、12歲至18歲以下、19歲至24歲以下，以及25歲至29歲）；有關新症個案的平均輪候時間為何；

（二）自「情緒通」18111精神健康支援熱線啓用至今，每年共接獲多少宗求助個案，其中透過該熱線作出轉介及獲支援的個案中，有多少宗涉及30歲或以下的青年；

（三）現時全港共有多少名具備精神健康資歷及曾接受相關培訓的基層醫生、輔助醫療人員及相關人士能在社區層面為青年提供識別、介入及初步提供心理治療的工作；當局現時在社區層面向在校及在職青年提供的精神健康支援措施，以及其成效分別為何；

（四）鑑於有意見指出，儘管近年學校和社區增加了青年在精神健康上的預防、評估及介入服務，惟有關服務很多時透過不同計劃及平台推出，青年要認識有關計劃並作出求助並不容易，當局會否考慮為青年提供一個結合地區支援的一站式服務平台，令青年更易作出諮詢、求助及獲得支援；及

（五）當局有何針對青年群體的措施，以減少有精神健康問題的青年因精神病患者被污名化而未有向外求助的問題？

答覆：

主席：

政府非常重視市民的精神健康。政府透過教育局、醫務衞生局（醫衞局）、衞生署、醫院管理局（醫管局）、勞工及福利局（勞福局）、社會福利署（社署）、非政府組織和社區內其他持份者之間的協調和合作，採用一個綜合模式推廣精神健康，為有精神健康需要人士（包括兒童及青少年）提供跨專業及跨界別的服務，包括精神健康的促進、預防、及早識別、介入、治療和康復服務，以及社區支援。

就梁毓偉議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署、教育局、醫管局、勞福局和社署後，現綜合回覆如下︰

（一）醫管局的精神科專科門診診所實施設有既定的新症分流制度，以確保病情緊急並需要及早診治的病人獲得優先跟進及治療。新轉介個案通常先由護士甄別，再經有關專科醫生覆核，然後分為第一優先（緊急）、第二優先（半緊急）和例行（穩定）類別個案。一般而言，有急切醫療需要的病人（如有嚴重暴力傾向或自殺傾向的患者），精神科專科門診會為他們安排第一優先（緊急）類別個案跟進，以確保他們能在合理的時間內盡早得到診治。於輪候期間，如病人的精神狀況有變，可返回所屬的精神科專科門診再次接受評估以判斷是否需要提前診期，或到急症室求診。

醫管局會繼續加強精神科專科門診的服務，改善緊急個案及半緊急個案的新症輪候時間，包括增加診症名額；亦會增強精神科護士診所的服務，讓患者在輪候專科門診或覆診期間亦會獲得跟進。

下表列出二○二二／二三年度、二○二三／二四年度及二○二四／二五年度醫管局精神科專科門診（臨床）首次就診人次，覆診人次及總人次：

註：由二○二二年十月一日起，綜合診所被納入精神科專科門診診所的新症輪候時間。

鑑於二○二○年初香港出現2019冠狀病毒病疫情，醫管局調節其服務以應對疫情。故在比較相關年度的醫管局服務量時，亦應將以上情況納入考慮當中。隨着各項防疫措施於二○二三年年初撤銷，醫管局服務已逐步回復正常。

（二）醫衞局推出「情緒通」18111精神健康支援熱線（「情緒通」），每日二十四小時一站式支援受情緒困擾的人士，為來自任何背景、任何年齡的市民提供情緖及精神健康支援，並因應個別來電者的需要提供服務資訊或轉介到適切的服務機構。

自二○二三年十二月二十七日啓動至二○二五年九月三十日，「情緒通」共接聽約208 000宗來電（即平均每日約330宗來電），提供即時支援，並轉介了510宗個案予社署精神健康綜合社區中心（綜合社區中心）、社署照顧者支援專線、醫管局精神健康專線及其他非政府機構，其中23宗屬較緊急個案，需要即時轉介警方跟進。在願意透露年齡的來電者中，11歲或以下、12至17歲、18至24歲及25至34歲人士分別佔約<1%、4%、9%及18%，而在轉介個案中，其相應比例則分別約為0%、2%、6%及22%。

（三）至（五）政府以綜合和跨專業模式提供精神健康服務，跨專業團隊包括醫生、護士、臨床心理學家、醫務社工和職業治療師等，在社區層面為青年提供精神健康相關支援。由於涉及眾多相關人員，而他們通常需要支援多項服務，因此無法獨立計算在社區層面為青年人提供精神健康支援所涉及的人力資源。

政府因應在校及在職青年的精神健康需要，在社區層面推出多項措施，以便有效幫助各群組應付其特定精神健康需要。

政府於二○二四年八月起，在三個地區康健中心／站推出了「健康心靈先導計劃」，為18歲或以上的會員提供免費的精神健康初步評估。被初步評估為有輕微抑鬱或焦慮症狀的會員將獲建議前往同區服務機構，由受過精神健康培訓的心理健康主任進行跟進，提供進一步情緒評估及低密度心理治療。根據《行政長官2025年施政報告》，政府計劃於二○二六年增加六個中心，提供更全面的後續服務。

此外，社署自二○一○年起在全港設立24間綜合社區中心，為精神復元人士、有精神健康需要人士（服務對象已擴展至15歲以下中學生）及其家人、照顧者和區內居民，提供由預防以至危機管理的一站式、地區為本的社區精神健康支援服務。為應對邊緣和隱蔽青少年的需要，政府於二○一八年起津助非政府機構設立五支網上青年支援隊，主動在網上平台搜尋並接觸邊緣和隱蔽青少年，以在線及離線模式適時提供介入、諮詢、支援，輔導和跟進服務。社署亦通過青少年情緒健康網上支援平台「Open噏」，為有情緒困擾及即時危機的青少年提供24小時即時網上輔導服務，讓他們可以隨時隨地得到適切的支援。另外，教育局的一站式學生精神健康資訊網站「校園‧好精神」除了提供有關提升學生精神健康的多元化資訊外，網站載有相關的社區資源和求助熱線，以協助學校、學生及家長更深入了解有關精神健康的資訊、服務和求助渠道。

在精神健康的宣傳和公眾教育方面，政府已推行「陪我講Shall We Talk」精神健康推廣及公眾教育計劃。計劃目標旨在提升公眾對精神健康推廣的參與程度；提高公眾對精神健康的了解並鼓勵巿民及早尋求協助；及減低公眾對有精神健康需要人士的誤解及歧視。「陪我講Shall We Talk」亦通過一站式網站，不同媒體專頁及線下活動等方式傳遞有關精神健康的訊息。為了接觸更多青年人，該計劃於各區中小學及大專院校舉行巡迴活動，又在社交媒體平台播放分享短片，鼓勵公眾正視精神健康，推廣精神健康信息。

如上述提及，政府已推出多項針對精神健康的工作，並推行三層應急機制，即預防、識別、介入及治療，支援青年精神健康。這些需要政府、社會和家庭等的共同努力，以減少污名化的影響，鼓勵青年在面對精神健康問題時積極尋求幫助。"
LCQ12: Support for mental health,2025-10-22 19:42,2025-10-22 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200585.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  There are views that in recent years, pressures from academic studies, families and interpersonal relationships, etc, coupled with the ever-changing social environment, have led to increasingly common mental health issues among young people. It has been reported that a study has even pointed out that among those aged 15 to 24 of the population, as many as 16.6per cent of the respondents have mental health issues, yet most of them have not sought assistance. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of new and follow-up cases involving children and young people at psychiatric specialist outpatient services in public hospitals in each of the past three years, as well as their respective percentages in the total number of cases, broken down by age group of the young people involved (i.e. under 6, 6 to under 12, 12 to under 18, 19 to under 24, and 25 to 29); the average waiting time for such new cases;

(2) of the total number of requests for assistance received each year since the launch of the ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" and, among the cases referred and supported through the hotline, the number of those involving young people aged 30 or below;

(3) of the current total number of primary care physicians, paramedical staff and relevant personnel with mental health qualifications and relevant training over the territory who can provide identification, intervention and preliminary psychological treatment for young people at the community level; the mental health support measures currently provided by the authorities at the community level for young people in school and at work, as well as their respective effectiveness;

(4) as there are views pointing out that despite the increase in mental health prevention, assessment and intervention services for young people in schools and communities in recent years, such services are often delivered through different programmes and platforms, making it not easy for young people to learn about these programmes and seek assistance, whether the authorities will consider providing young people with a one-stop service platform integrated with district support, thereby making it easier for young people to seek consultation and assistance as well as receive support; and

(5) of the measures put in place by the authorities targeted at the youth community to reduce the problem of young people with mental health issues not seeking assistance due to the stigma against patients with mental illnesses?

Reply:

President,

  The Government attaches great importance to the mental health of the public. Through co-ordination and collaboration among the Education Bureau (EDB), the Health Bureau (HHB), the Department of Health (DH), the Hospital Authority (HA), the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB), the Social Welfare Department (SWD), non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and other community stakeholders, the Government adopts an integrated approach to promote mental health. This approach provides multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral services to people with mental health needs (including children and adolescents), encompassing mental health promotion, prevention, early identification, intervention, treatment, rehabilitation services, and community support.

  In consultation with the DH, EDB, HA, LWB and SWD, the consolidated reply in response to the question raised by the Hon Kenneth Leung is as follows:

(1) The HA psychiatric specialist outpatient clinics (SOPCs) implemented an established new case triage system to ensure that patients with urgent conditions requiring early diagnosis and treatment receive priority follow-up and treatment. New referrals are typically screened by nurses first and reviewed by the relevant specialists before cases are being classified as Priority 1 (urgent), Priority 2 (semi-urgent), and Routine (stable) cases. Generally speaking, psychiatric SOPCs will classify patients with urgent medical needs as Priority 1 (urgent) cases for follow-up to ensure they will receive treatment within reasonable time. Patients may return to their respective psychiatric specialist outpatient services to receive assessment again if their mental conditions have changed during the waiting time, so that an assessment could be made as to whether there is a need to advance their consultation, or they may consider seeking treatment from the accident and emergency services.

  The HA will continue to strengthen the services of its psychiatric SOPCs, improve waiting times for urgent and semi-urgent new cases, including by increasing the number of consultation slots. The services of psychiatric nurse clinics will also be enhanced to ensure that patients receive follow-up care while waiting for specialist outpatient appointments or during follow-up appointments.

  The tables below set out the number of first, follow-up and total attendances of the psychiatric specialist outpatient (clinical) services in the HA in 2022/23, 2023/24 and 2024/25:

Notes:
(1) Age groups are delineated according to the age attained as of June 30 of the respective year.
(2) Individual figures may not add up to the total due to rounding and the inclusion of unknown age groups.

  The HA has implemented a triage system on specialist outpatient (SOP) services to determine the priority of patients attending SOPCs based on their clinical condition. Statistics on waiting time for new cases at SOPCs by age group are not available.

  In 2022/23, 2023/24 and 2024/25, the number of new cases triaged as Priority 1 (urgent), Priority 2 (semi-urgent) and Routine (stable) cases and their respective median (50th percentile) waiting time in the HA for child and adolescent psychiatric SOP service and adult psychiatric SOP service are tabulated below:

Note: With effect from October 1, 2022, the waiting time for new case bookings at integrated clinics has been incorporated in that at psychiatric SOPCs.

  In view of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in Hong Kong in early 2020, the HA adjusted its services to cope with the outbreak. This should be taken into consideration when comparing the service capacity of the HA in the respective years. With the cessation of anti-epidemic measures in early 2023, the HA has been gradually resuming the provision of all of its services.

(2) The HHB launched the ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" (MHSH) to provide one-stop, round-the-clock support for people with mental health needs, rendering emotional and mental health support to persons from all backgrounds and of all ages. Callers will be provided with service information or referred to appropriate service organisations based on their individual needs.

  Since its launch on December 27, 2023, up to September 30, 2025, MHSH has handled a total of around 208 000 calls (an average of around 330 calls per day) and provided immediate support. Of these, 510 cases were referred to the Integrated Community Centre for Mental Wellness (ICCMW)of the SWD, Designated Hotline for Carer Support of the SWD, the Mental Health Direct hotline of the HA and other NGOs. Among these referrals, 23 cases were more urgent and required immediate referral to the Police for follow-up. Among callers willing to disclose their age, those aged 11 or below, 12 to 17 years, 18 to 24 years and 25 to 34 years constituted approximately <1 per cent, 4 per cent, 9 per cent and 18 per cent respectively, while these groups constituted about 0 per cent, 2 per cent, 6 per cent and 22 per cent of the referral cases, respectively.

(3) to (5) The Government adopts an integrated and multidisciplinary approach when providing mental health services. The multidisciplinary teams, including doctors, nurses, clinical psychologists, medical social workers, and occupational therapists, provide mental health-related support to young people at the community level. Due to the participation of numerous individuals who typically provide support across multiple services, it is thus not feasible to have separate breakdowns of the human resources allocated solely to deliver mental health support to young people at the community level.

  The Government has introduced a number of measures at the community level to address the mental health needs of young people in education and employment, effectively helping each group managing their specific mental health needs.

  From August 2024, the Government launched the Healthy Mind Pilot Project at three District Health Centre (DHC)/ Expresses, to offer free initial mental health assessments to members aged 18 or above. Members initially assessed to have mild symptoms of depression or anxiety will be referred to service providers in the same district for follow-up by trained Wellbeing Practitioners, providing further emotional assessment and evidence-based low-intensity psychological therapy. As outlined in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, the Government will extend the project to cover six more DHCs in 2026 to provide more comprehensive follow-up services.

  In addition, the SWD has since 2010 established 24 ICCMWs in the territory to provide one-stop, district-based community mental health support services ranging from prevention to risk management for persons in mental recovery, persons with mental health needs (target group has been extended to cover secondary school students aged below 15), their families, carers, and local residents. To meet the needs of at-risk and hidden youths, the Government has since 2018 provided subventions to NGOs to set up five Cyber Youth Support Teams to proactively search and reach out to at-risk and hidden youths through online platforms, providing timely intervention, counselling, support, guidance and follow-up services through both online and offline modes. The SWD also provides 24-hour online counselling services for youth experiencing emotional distress and immediate crises through the real-time youth emotional health support platform ""OpenUp"", allowing them to receive support anytime, anywhere. Furthermore, the EDB's one-stop student mental health information website, ""Mental Health @ School"", not only provides diverse information on improving student mental health, but also includes relevant community resources and helplines to help schools, students, and parents gain a deeper understanding of mental health information, services, and help-seeking channels.

  In terms of mental health publicity and public education, the Government has launched the ""Shall We Talk"" mental health promotion and public education program. The programme aims to step up public engagement in promoting mental well-being, enhance public awareness of mental health with a view to encouraging help-seeking and early intervention, and reduce stigma towards people with mental health needs. Through the one-stop website, social media pages and offline events, ""Shall We Talk"" delivers messages on mental health. In order to reach out to more young people, the programme held tours at primary and secondary schools across different districts, as well as tertiary institutions, and broadcast videos on social media platforms to encourage the public to recognise mental health issues, to promote mental health messages.

  As mentioned above, the Government has launched a number of mental health initiatives and implemented a three-tier response mechanism, i.e. prevention, identification, intervention and treatment, to support youth mental health. This requires concerted efforts from the Government, society and families to reduce stigmatisation and encourage young people to actively seek help when facing mental health issues."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-22 19:25,2025-10-22 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200675.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十二日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

本港今年累計錄得42宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。其中，一名早前公布的77歲有長期病患的男患者今日情況轉差病逝。他於十月十三日由中國內地回港，同日出現發燒及關節痛，十月十四日出現皮疹，到私家醫院求醫並入院接受治療，其後病情惡化被轉送律敦治醫院深切治療部。他的臨床診斷為基孔肯雅熱併發多個器官衰竭。

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：
• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
立法會二十一題：地區康健中心,2025-10-22 19:20,2025-10-22 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200622.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上陳凱欣議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

政府於二○一九年起開始在全港18區設立地區康健中心和地區康健站（統稱「康健中心」），提供慢性疾病篩查和管理，以及精神健康評估等服務。據悉部分康健中心的營運服務合約已陸續約滿，而基層醫療署亦已重新招標。政府於今年三月二十六日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，基層醫療署已調整康健中心的營運服務合約，包括調整服務目標分類，並在與營運機構簽訂新營運服務合約或續約時，加入新的表現評估指標，並正逐步加強康健中心的表現監察機制，以評估各所康健中心的表現。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每所康健中心在調整其營運服務合約前落實服務目標的情況分別為何，以及政府為未達標的康健中心提供何等協助或跟進；

（二）根據調整後的營運服務合約及表現監察機制，現時每所康健中心落實（i）服務目標、（ii）表現評估指標及（iii）表現監察機制下不同監察範疇的情況分別為何；政府有否制訂時間表定期檢視康健中心落實第（i）至（iii）項的情況，並按相關檢視結果向康健中心提供適切協助或跟進；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）自第一所康健中心成立至今，曾約滿的康健中心名單為何，包括其中（i）獲得續約，以及（ii）須重新公開招標的康健中心名單，以及相關康健中心未獲續約的原因；

（四）自第一所康健中心成立至今，每所康健中心每年（i）物理治療、（ii）職業治療、（iii）營養服務，以及（iv）藥劑服務的使用人次分別為何；自政府於今年一月起新增專屬護士診所及專職醫療服務以來，有關服務的每月平均使用人次分別為何；

（五）鑑於三所康健中心於去年八月十五日起推行「健康心靈先導計劃」（該計劃），至今共為多少名市民進行精神健康初步評估，當中有多少名參加者分別獲轉介接受低密度心理治療和轉介至精神健康綜合社區中心進行跟進；有否統計，在完成該心理治療的參加者中，有多少名再度透過該計劃接受心理治療，或尋求其他公營心理治療服務；

（六）鑑於該計劃是以試行性質由去年八月至明年一月運作18個月，現距離該計劃結束尚餘不足半年，政府有否就該計劃進行階段性評估；如有，詳情為何；及

（七）政府會否考慮在康健中心的營運服務合約中，加入更多服務目標分類，例如提供社區藥房、驗眼服務，以及情緒健康支援等；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因及所涉的困難為何？

答覆：

主席：

作為基層醫療健康資源樞紐，地區康健中心和地區康健站（統稱為康健中心）提供包括慢性疾病篩查及管理、家庭醫生配對、健康推廣、健康風險評估和社區復康等服務。

就陳凱欣議員提問的各部分，經諮詢基層醫療署後，現回覆如下：

（一）、（二）、（三）及（七）基層醫療署對每間康健中心均設有設施和服務要求，載列於營運服務合約中，包括主要人員的資歷和相關經驗、設立附屬中心／服務點的地區和數目、中心人手編制，以及服務量目標等。康健中心營運機構須根據營運服務合約提供服務。基層醫療署一直監察、評核營運機構的工作，並適時向營運機構提出改善建議，如建議增加外展服務、加強社區宣傳與推廣等。基層醫療署會在考慮續約時將相關評核結果納入考慮，以鼓勵營運機構持續提升服務水平。如營運機構未能履行合約要求，政府亦有權終止營運服務合約。

三年新冠疫情無可避免影響康健中心的籌備和開展，以及啓用後招募會員和提供服務的進度，而在起步階段的康健中心亦需要營運一定時間方能提升會員數目及服務量。隨着新冠疫後復常，以及康健中心達到「18區全覆蓋」後，康健中心已逐漸在社區建立初具規模的基層醫療健康服務網絡。康健中心協助推廣「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」（「慢病共治計劃」）以強化「一人一家庭醫生」概念，並透過今年新設立的三間「樂妍站」加強婦女健康相關的推廣和教育，進一步擴闊社區基層醫療網絡。政府正分階段擴展《基層醫療指南》以涵蓋更多專職醫療人員（現時西醫、牙醫、執業中醫師、職業治療師和物理治療師已有分支名冊），以推動跨專業團隊為市民提供全面的基層醫療服務。

截至二○二五年六月三十日，康健中心的累計會員人數已經超過42萬名。為強化康健中心統籌社區基層醫療服務及個案經理的角色，基層醫療署已調整康健中心的營運服務合約，包括調整服務目標分類，如為市民配對家庭醫生和提供護士診所服務，以配合康健中心服務優化。經過調整合約要求及康健中心運作累積經驗後，各康健中心的服務人次亦持續增加（見附件一）。所有康健中心於二○二四至二五年度均符合服務量目標要求。

地區康健中心營運服務合約的首營運期為營運日起計三年及另附帶可續約三年條款；而地區康健站營運服務合約的首營運期為三年及另附帶可多次延長營運期限的條款。基層醫療署會按合約條款，於首營運期完結前並視乎營運機構的表現，安排續約或進行公開招標物色營運機構。自第一間康健中心開始營運至今，所有首營運期已完結的康健中心均已獲續約或延長營運期限。其中，葵青地區康健中心獲續約後，其共六年（三年首營運期加三年續約期）的合約期限已屆滿，因此基層醫療署已經重新公開招標，並已批出營運服務合約。另外，為擴充個別地區康健站（包括中西區、油尖旺、東區）為地區康健中心，基層醫療署已經公開招標，並已批出營運服務合約。

由於過往營運服務合約所定的目標主要着重服務量，隨基層醫療服務模式和規模持續發展和演進，基層醫療署已在訂立新營運服務合約或續約時，更新服務目標分類，涵蓋藥物諮詢服務、新會員參加「慢病共治計劃」的指標、精神健康推廣及教育等，並會就主要服務目標進行重點監察。基層醫療署會因應各區新建地區康健中心工程進度或現有營運服務合約期限，與營運機構簽訂新營運服務合約或續約。現時，九間地區康健中心（包括中西區、油尖旺、東區、葵青、深水埗、屯門、黃大仙、元朗及南區）的營運機構已簽訂新營運服務合約或續約。

（四）基層醫療署對每間康健中心均設有第一類和第二類服務目標要求（註一），當中已包括不同專職醫療服務人次（物理治療、職業治療、營養服務，及藥劑服務的服務人次）。各康健中心的服務模式視乎各區的服務需求亦會有所不同，因此，基層醫療署會根據服務合約條款內的第一類及第二類服務目標，監察各康健中心營運機構的表現及達標情況。有關各康健中心的第一類及第二類服務截至二○二四至二五年度的累計服務人次見附件二。

政府在二○二五年一月二十日透過策略採購，增設「慢病共治計劃」專屬護士診所及專職醫療服務，為「慢病共治計劃」的參加者提供涵蓋範圍更廣、連貫性更好的醫療服務。截至二○二五年九月三十日（臨時數據），約有11 800人次已接受相關專屬護士診所及專職醫療服務。

註二：數字調整至最接近的百位數，因此單項總和未必與總計相同。

（五）及（六）現時三間康健中心（屯門地區康健中心、油尖旺地區康健站和東區地區康健站）自二○二四年八月推出「健康心靈先導計劃」，試行在社區層面為市民提供免費精神健康評估和安排跟進。

「健康心靈先導計劃」目前成效良好。截至二○二五年九月三十日，三間指定的康健中心已為約30 500名市民進行先導計劃的精神健康初步評估。經初步評估後，有輕微抑鬱或焦慮症狀的會員會獲建議到與先導計劃同區的服務提供機構（服務機構），由曾接受精神健康培訓的心理健康主任跟進。加上透過服務機構舉辦的活動參與先導計劃的市民，共有約4 900位完成進一步評估。適合和同意接受治療的參加者中，約有1 700位正接受／已完成低密度心理治療，當中約有180位需轉介至專科或高密度精神健康服務（例如精神健康綜合社區中心）跟進。另外，在完成低密度心理治療的參加者中，按服務數據顯示並沒有參加者再度透過計劃接受治療。

如《行政長官2025年施政報告》所述，政府會於二○二六年增加六個康健中心作為試點（即共於九間康健中心），由具備心理學或輔導學等學歷背景及訓練的人員提供跟進服務。為確保「健康心靈先導計劃」順利進行，基層醫療署已成立工作小組，負責持續推行有關計劃。

註一：第一類服務包括健康推廣／教育。第二類服務包括健康風險因素評估、糖尿病及高血壓篩查、慢性疾病管理、社區復康及婦女健康服務。"
LCQ21: District Health Centres,2025-10-22 19:20,2025-10-22 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200642.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  The Government has set up District Health Centres (DHCs) and DHC Expresses (collectively referred to as ""DHCs"") in all 18 districts over the territory since 2019 to provide services such as chronic disease screening and management, as well as mental health assessments. It is learnt that the operating service contracts of some DHCs have gradually expired, and the Primary Healthcare Commission has conducted tenders again. In its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on March 26 this year, the Government advised that the Primary Healthcare Commission had adjusted the operating service contracts of DHCs, including adjusting the categorisation of service targets and adding new performance assessment indicators when entering into new or renewed operating service contracts with the operators, and was progressively enhancing the performance monitoring mechanism of DHCs to assess the performance of various DHCs. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective status of achieving the service targets of each DHC prior to the adjustment to their operating service contracts in the past five years, and the assistance offered to or follow-up made with those DHCs that failed to meet the targets set by the Government;

(2) under the adjusted operating service contracts and performance monitoring mechanism, of the current status of each DHC in (i) achieving the service targets, (ii) meeting the performance assessment indicators, and (iii) various monitoring aspects under the performance monitoring mechanism; whether the Government has set a timetable for regularly reviewing the performance of DHCs in (i) to (iii), and providing appropriate assistance to or making follow-up with DHCs in the light of the outcome of the reviews; if so, the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) of the list of DHCs of which the contracts had expired since the launch of the first DHC, including (i) those with contracts renewed and (ii) those requiring open tender again and the reasons why the DHCs concerned were not granted contract renewal;

(4) since the launch of the first DHC, of the respective annual usages of (i) physiotherapy, (ii) occupational therapy, (iii) dietitian services, and (iv) pharmacy services at each DHC; and the respective average monthly usages of the new dedicated nurse clinic and allied health services since their introduction in January this year;

(5) given that the Healthy Mind Pilot Project (HMPP) has been launched at three DHCs since August 15 last year, of the number of members of the public who have undergone preliminary mental health assessments to date, and the respective numbers of those who were referred for low-intensity psychological therapy and those referred to Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness for follow-up; whether statistics have been compiled on the number of those who, after completing the said psychological therapy, subsequently have received psychological therapy again through HMPP or sought other public psychological therapy services;

(6) given that HMPP is running on a trial basis for 18 months from August last year to January next year, with less than half a year remaining before its conclusion, whether the Government has conducted a phased assessment of HMPP; if so, of the details; and

(7) whether the Government will consider incorporating more service target categorisation into the operating service contracts of DHCs, such as the provision of community pharmacies, eye examination services, and emotional health support; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that and the challenges involved?

Reply:

President,

  As primary healthcare resource hubs, District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) provide services including chronic disease screening and management, family doctor pairing, health promotion, health risk assessment and community rehabilitation.

  In consultation with the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission), the replies to the respective parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan are as follows:

(1), (2), (3) and (7) The PHC Commission stipulates facility and service requirements for each DHC, as specified in the operation service contract, including the qualifications and relevant experience of key staff, the districts and number of ancillary centres/service points to be set up, the staffing establishment of the centres and service volume targets. The DHC operators shall provide services in accordance with the operation service contract. The PHC Commission continuously monitors and evaluates the operators' performance, and will make timely recommendations to the operators for improvement, such as recommending increased outreach services and enhanced community publicity and promotion. The PHC Commission will take into account the relevant assessment results when considering contract renewal, with a view to encouraging the operators to continuously enhance service standards. The Government shall have the right to terminate the operation service contract if an operator fails to comply with the contract requirements.

  The three years of COVID-19 epidemic inevitably affected the preparatory work and commencement of the DHCs, as well as their progress in recruitment of members and service provision after commencement. At the initial stage, the DHCs also needed to operate for a certain period before they could accumulate membership numbers and increase service capacity. With the resumption of normalcy after the COVID-19 epidemic, coupled with the establishment of DHCs covering all 18 districts, the DHCs have been gradually building a primary healthcare service network which begins to take shape in the community. The DHCs assist in promoting the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme (CDCC Pilot Scheme) to reinforce the concept of ""Family Doctor for All"", and in strengthening women's health promotion and education through the three Women Wellness Satellites newly established this year, thereby further expanding the community primary healthcare network. The Government is expanding the Primary Care Directory in phases to cover more allied health professionals (sub-directories are developed for doctors, dentists, practising Chinese medicine practitioners, occupational therapists and physiotherapists currently), with a view to promoting multidisciplinary collaboration in providing comprehensive primary healthcare services to citizens.

  As at June 30, 2025, the cumulative number of DHC members was more than 420 000. To strengthen the role of DHCs as the co-ordinators of community primary healthcare services and case managers, the PHC Commission has adjusted the terms of the operation service contracts of DHCs, including adjusting the categorisation of service targets, such as the pairing of family doctors with citizens and the provision of nurse clinic services, in order to tie in with the enhancement of DHC services. With the adjustments to contract requirements and the accumulation of operational experience of DHCs, the numbers of service attendances at all DHCs have continued to increase (see Annex I). All DHCs attained the service volume targets in 2024-25.

  The initial operation period of the District Health Centre operation service contracts is three years from the date of operation with an option for contract extension of up to further three years, whereas the initial operation period of the District Health Centre Express operation service contracts is three years with the option for multiple operation period extensions. The PHC Commission will, in accordance with the terms of the contract and subject to the performance of the operator, arrange for contract renewal or conduct an open tender exercise to identify an operator before the expiry of the initial operation period. Since the operation commencement of the first DHC, all DHCs whose initial operation periods have expired have had their contracts renewed or their operation periods extended. Among them, following the renewal of the Kwai Tsing District Health Centre's service contract, its six-year term (comprising an initial three-year operation period plus a three-year renewal period) has expired. Subsequently, the PHC Commission has conducted a new open tender exercise and awarded the operation service contract. Separately, in order to upgrade certain District Health Centre Expresses (including Central and Western District, Yau Tsim Mong District and Eastern District) into District Health Centres, the PHC Commission has conducted the open tender exercises and awarded the operation service contracts.

  The targets set under previous operation service contracts primarily focused on service volume. With the ongoing development and evolution of primary healthcare service models and scale, the PHC Commission has updated the classification of service targets when establishing new or renewed operational service contracts. These include drug advisory services, indicators for new members joining the CDCC Pilot Scheme, mental health promotion and education. Key service targets will be subject to particular monitoring. Depending on the progress of the construction works of the new District Health Centres in various districts or the expiry date of the current operation service contracts, the PHC Commission will enter into new or renewed operation service contracts with the operators. Currently, the operators of nine District Health Centres (including Central and Western District, Yau Tsim Mong, Eastern District, Kwai Tsing, Sham Shui Po, Tuen Mun, Wong Tai Sin, Yuen Long and Southern District) have signed new operation service contracts or renewed their contracts.

(4) The PHC Commission has set Category 1 and Category 2 service targets (Note 1) for each DHC, including service volume target for different allied health disciplines (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetic services and pharmacist service attendances). The service model of each DHC may vary depending on the service demand of different districts. As such, the PHC Commission will monitor the performance and achievement of targets by individual DHC operators in accordance with the Category 1 and Category 2 service targets specified in the service contracts. The cumulative number of Category 1 and Category 2 service attendances for all DHCs as at 2024-25 is at Annex II.

  On January 20, 2025, the Government introduced dedicated nurse clinic and allied health services through strategic purchasing to offer a broader scope of healthcare services with better coherence to the CDCC Pilot Scheme participants. As at September 30, 2025 (provisional figures), about 11 800 service attendances have received the relevant dedicated nursing clinic and allied health services.

Dietitian

Total

Note 2: Figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred, so the sum of individual items may not necessarily equal the grand total.

(5) and (6) At present, three DHCs (Tuen Mun District Health Centre, and Yau Tsim Mong District Health Centre Express and Eastern District Health Centre Express) have launched the Healthy Mind Pilot Project (Pilot Project) since August 2024, to offer free mental health assessments and follow-up for members of the public on a trial basis at the community level.

  Currently, the Healthy Mind Pilot Project has been producing satisfactory results. As of September 30, 2025, the three designated DHCs have conducted preliminary mental health assessments for approximately 30 500 members of the public. Members preliminarily assessed to have mild symptoms of depression or anxiety will be recommended to service providers of the Pilot Project in the same district for follow-up by Wellbeing Practitioners who had received mental health training. Including members of the public who participated in the Pilot Project through activities organised by the service providers, about 4 900 individuals completed the further assessment. Of those eligible participants who consented to intervention, about 1 700 individuals are currently receiving or have completed low-intensity psychological intervention (LIPI). Among them, around 180 individuals required referral to specialist or high-intensity mental health services (such as Integrated Community Centres for Mental Wellness) for further follow-up. Additionally, among participants who completed LIPI, service data indicates that none subsequently re-enrolled in the Pilot Project for treatment.

  As outlined in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", the Government will extend the Pilot Project to cover six more DHCs in 2026 (i.e. a total of nine DHCs), with follow-up services provided by practitioners with an academic background and training in fields such as psychology or counselling. To ensure the smooth implementation of the Healthy Mind Pilot Project, the PHC Commission has established a working group responsible for the ongoing implementation of the Pilot Project.

Note 1: Category 1 service includes health promotion/education. Category 2 service includes health risk factor assessment, screening for diabetes mellitus and hypertension, chronic disease management, community rehabilitation and women's health services."

​立法會二題：保護學生視力健康,2025-10-22 18:55,2025-10-22 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200672.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上林順潮議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

根據衞生署的資料，二○二三至二○二四學年有百分之五十三點八的小六學生配戴眼鏡，而中學生配戴眼鏡的比例更高達百分之六十三。兒童及青少年患上深近視人數的百分比亦呈上升趨勢，情況令人擔憂。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否擴展衞生署學生健康服務提供的視力測試範圍，包括為學生進行詳細的視力度數檢查，而非只進行視力篩查檢測，讓學生能及早了解視力和近視情況並預防近視惡化；

（二）據報由於部分家長未能抽空帶子女參加由學生健康服務提供的視力測試，以致該測試的覆蓋率僅約百分之六十五，政府有否研究如何提升有關覆蓋率；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）會否研究在基層醫療健康系統中，推廣新興的控制近視方法，例如離焦鏡片、角膜矯形鏡（俗稱「OK鏡」）、低濃度阿托品眼藥水等治療，並建立相關的公私營轉介及基層家庭兒童資助機制？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直致力保護兒童和青少年視力健康，其中衞生署透過母嬰健康院和學生健康服務中心為全港兒童和青少年由出生至中學畢業每年提供免費的視力檢查服務，從而及早識別有視力問題的學生，並為他們適時提供建議和介入服務。

就林順潮議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署和醫院管理局（醫管局），現回覆如下：

（一）衞生署母嬰健康院免費為初生嬰兒作詳細的身體檢查，當中包括眼睛檢查，從而抽出一些患有先天性眼部問題的嬰兒。其後，母嬰健康院會為四至五歲學前兒童提供免費的「學前兒童視力普查」，從而及早發現有弱視、斜視或嚴重屈光等問題的幼童。以二○二四年為例，有超過23 600名學前兒童參加該免費的視力普查，而我們轉介了15%視力有問題的兒童至眼科專科醫生作進一步跟進。

當步入就學階段，衞生署為全港約40萬中小學生每年提供免費且全面的周年健康檢查服務。其中，不論他們有沒有配戴眼鏡，都會獲安排接受視力篩查。衞生署提供的視力篩查內容及標準均符合世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二三年所制定的最新指引。

就林順潮議員的第一條提問，其實我們的周年健康檢查又「點止篩查咁簡單」？在篩查後，衞生署有跟進作詳細的眼科檢查，例如在二○二三／二四學年，於接受免費周年健康檢查的約257 000名小學生當中，約35%需要配戴眼鏡。經檢查後發現，接近20%的小學生，即約51 000人未能通過初步視力測試篩查。他們獲轉介至衞生署轄下健康評估服務的視光師作進一步視力評估。在上述約51 000人當中，超過60%，即約32 000人最終接受了衞生署視光師的進一步視力評估，包括視力度數檢查、瞳孔檢查、眼底鏡檢查及斜視檢查等。另外亦有家長選擇私人執業視光師為其子女作評估及跟進。患有一般屈光問題的學生應配置正確度數的眼鏡以矯正視力，其他患眼疾的學生會獲轉介至醫管局眼科專科跟進。

（二）就第二條問題，林議員提到（學生健康服務提供的視力測試）總覆蓋率為65%，是因為家長未能抽空帶子女參加。我要在此澄清，這是一個不正確的資料。因為參加周年健康檢查需要家長同意，但不需要陪同子女參加。數據顯示，在二○二三／二四學年，全港98.8%的中小學校參與衞生署免費周年健康檢查，當中包括視力測試。我們看到非常高、接近百分百的學校參與率，我們很感謝學校的積極參與和重視學生健康。

不過，在學生覆蓋率方面，涉及家長同意，事實上覆蓋約257 000名小學生，覆蓋率僅為78.6%）。中學生的服務覆蓋率則更低，涉及約173 000名，覆蓋率只有53.6%。其中，中一學生的覆蓋率為71%，而到中三下降至56.3%，到中六更下降至30.9%。簡單而言，愈高年級、愈年長的學生，愈不喜歡接受身體檢查。至於為何高年級學生參與率較低，我相信有很多因素，包括可能學業更趨緊張、課外活動愈來愈多，又或長大後自覺身體狀況良好，而家長亦未能着子女參與，因此參與率絕對無關家長未能抽空陪同子女參加。

習近平主席曾說，健康是「1」，其他是後面的「0」，沒有「1」，後面再多的「0」也沒有意義。學生不能看清楚黑板，又如何學習和上學呢？周年健康檢查需時只約90分鐘，便能為學生的健康帶來深遠益處。我在此希望學校，以及特別是家長更盡力配合，共同守護孩子健康成長。

我再次重申，參加周年健康檢查需要家長同意，但衞生署並沒有要求家長陪同子女參加。多年來，衞生署為學校安排周年健康檢查服務的時間，更為參與周年健康檢查服務的學校提供免費穿梭巴士接載服務，以便學校安排更多學生集體參加衞生署學生健康服務。衞生署於二○二四／二五學年更推出網上報名方式，以便利更多學生參加周年健康檢查服務。

（三）預防勝於治療，要有效預防近視及避免近視加深，保持良好的護眼習慣和定期進行視力檢查才是治本之道。世界上多個地區，包括內地和新加坡，均主張透過健康教育、增加戶外活動和減少使用電子屏幕等方法預防及控制近視。衞生署將繼續透過周年健康檢查及健康促進教育，鼓勵學生建立健康的生活方式，包括按世衞建議，每天進行最少60分鐘中等至劇烈強度的體能活動，減少使用電子屏幕產品時間及遵守護眼守則等。

近年有部分視光中心提倡一些聲稱有助控制或減低近視的產品和治療方案，但有關產品和治療方案的成效因人而異，採用與否視乎很多因素，例如家長與學童的選擇、時間安排、經濟能力，以至整體社會的成本效益。家長在決定是否為子女選擇一般眼鏡或新產品和治療方案時，應考慮多方面因素，並諮詢註冊視光師和註冊眼科專科醫生的專業意見。

多謝主席。"
LCQ2: Protecting students' vision health,2025-10-22 18:55,2025-10-22 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200673.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Dennis Lam and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

According to the information from the Department of Health (DH), in the 2023-2024 school year, 53.8 per cent of Primary Six students wore glasses, while the proportion of secondary school students wearing glasses was even higher, at 63 per cent. The percentage of children and adolescents suffering from high myopia is also on the rise, which is a cause for concern. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will expand the scope of the visual acuity tests provided by DH's Student Health Service (SHS) to include detailed refraction tests for students, instead of conducting only screening tests, so as to enable students to understand their visual and myopia conditions at an early stage and prevent the progression of myopia;

(2) as it has been reported that some parents are unable to spare the time to bring their children to undergo the visual acuity tests provided by SHS, resulting in a coverage rate of only about 65 per cent for such tests, whether the Government has studied how to raise the coverage rate; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it will study the promotion of emerging myopia control therapies in the primary healthcare system, such as defocus lenses, orthokeratology lenses (commonly known as ""OK lenses"") and low-concentration atropine eye drops, and establish relevant public-private referral and subsidy mechanisms for children from grass-roots families?

Reply:

President,

The Government has been safeguarding the visual health of children and adolescents. Among others, the Department of Health (DH) has been providing free visual assessment services for children and adolescents annually in Hong Kong from birth until secondary school graduation through Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) and Student Health Service (SHS) Centres. These services enable the early identification of students with visual acuity problems, as well as timely provision of advice and intervention.

In consultation with the DH and Hospital Authority (HA), the reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Dennis Lam is set out below:

(1) The MCHCs of the DH offer free and detailed physical examinations, including eye examinations, for newborn babies to rule out those with congenital visual defects. After that, the MCHCs offer free Pre-school Vision Screening for pre-school children aged 4 to 5, so as to identify those with problems, such as amblyopia, squint or significant refractive errors, as early as possible. For instance, in 2024, more than 23 600 pre-school children took part in the free vision screening, and we referred 15 per cent of them with visual acuity problems to ophthalmologists for follow-ups.

When children enter the school years, the DH offers free and comprehensive annual health assessment services, including vision screening, for approximately 400 000 primary and secondary school students annually. Regardless of whether the students wear glasses, they will be arranged to undergo vision screening. The vision screening tests and standards provided by the DH are consistent with the latest guidelines published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2023.

In response to Dr the Hon Dennis Lam's first question, our annual health assessments is far more than just screening. After the initial screening, the DH follows up with detailed ophthalmic examinations. For example, in the 2023/24 school year, among the some 257 000 primary school students who received free annual health assessments, approximately 35 per cent of them wore glasses. Following assessment, it was found that nearly 20 per cent, approximately 51 000 students failed the preliminary visual acuity test screening. They were referred to optometrists in the DH's health assessment services for further visual assessment. Among the aforementioned some 51 000 students, more than 60 per cent, i.e. about 32 000, of them underwent further assessments provided by optometrists of the DH, including diopter tests, pupil examination, retinoscopy and testing for squint. Meanwhile, some parents chose to consult private optometrists for assessments and follow-ups for their children. Students with common refractive problem should wear glasses with the correct prescription to improve their vision, while others identified with vision problems will be referred to the HA Ophthalmology for follow-ups.

(2) Regarding the second question, Dr the Hon Dennis Lam mentioned that the overall coverage rate (for the vision screening provided by the SHS) was 65 per cent as parents were unable to spare time to accompany their children to join the screening. I have to clarify that this piece of information is incorrect, because participation in the annual health assessments requires parental consent, but parents are not required to accompany their children. As revealed in the statistics, in the 2023/24 school year, 98.8 per cent of primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong participated in the DH's free annual health assessment services, which include vision tests. We see a very high, near full school participation rate, and we are grateful for schools' active involvement and emphasis on students' health.

However, in terms of student coverage, there were 257 000 primary school students with parental consent, the coverage rate for primary school students was just 78.6 per cent. The service coverage rate for secondary school students was even lower, involved about 173 000 students, rated at only 53.6 per cent. Among them, the coverage rate for Secondary One students was 71 per cent, which dropped to 56.3 per cent by Secondary Three, and further dropped to 30.9 per cent by Secondary Six. In short, the higher grade and the older the students, the less interest for them to join the health assessments. As for why participation is lower among higher grade students, I believe there are many factors, including increasing academic pressure, more extracurricular activities, or self-perception of good health after grown-up while parents are unable to persuade their children to take part. Therefore, the participation rate has definitely nothing to do with parents being unable to spare time to accompany their children to join the screening.

As President Xi Jinping said that health is the ""1"", and everything else is the ""0"" that follows. Without the ""1"", no matter how many ""0s"" follows, it has no meaning. If students cannot see the blackboard clearly, how can they learn and attend school? An annual health assessment takes only about 90 minutes and brings significant benefits to students' health. I hope schools, and especially parents should be more committed to working together to safeguard the healthy growth of children.

I would like to reiterate that, participation in the annual health assessments requires parental consent, but the DH does not require parents to accompany their children. For many years, the DH arranges time for annual health assessments for schools, and even provide free shuttle bus services to participating schools of the annual health assessment services, facilitating schools to arrange more students to attend the annual health assessment services. The DH has even implemented online enrolment starting from the 2024/25 school year to facilitate student participation in the annual health assessment services.

(3) Prevention is better than cure. Maintaining good eye care habits and having regular vision examinations are essential to preventing myopia and slowing its progression. Many regions in the world, including the Chinese Mainland and Singapore, advocate myopia prevention and control through ways including health education, promoting outdoor activities and reducing the use of electronic screen products. The DH will continue to encourage students to develop healthy lifestyles through annual health assessments and health promotion education. This includes accumulating at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily, as recommended by the WHO, reducing the use of electronic screen products and observing to guidelines on eye health.

In recent years, some optometry centres have promoted products and treatments claiming to help control or slow the progression of myopia. However, the effectiveness of these products and treatments varies among individuals, and whether to adopt them depends on many factors, such as the preferences of parents and students, time arrangements, financial ability and the overall cost-effectiveness to society. Parents should consider multiple factors and seek professional advice from registered optometrists and ophthalmologists when deciding whether to choose the prescription glasses or new products and treatments for their children.

Thank you, President."

立法會六題：支援有輕生風險的學生,2025-10-22 18:05,2025-10-22 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200527.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上陸頌雄議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的答覆︰

根據教育局資料，二○二○年至二○二四年共有130多名學童輕生。此外，據報二○二四至二○二五學年患有抑鬱症及焦慮症等精神疾病的中、小學生人數較五年前大幅增加。關於支援有輕生風險的學生，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，有多少宗學生輕生死亡及輕生未遂的個案，以及當中有多少名學童有特殊教育需要、或患有抑鬱症或焦慮症，並按學生的年齡組別（包括0至6歲、7至12歲、13至18歲，以及18歲以上）列出分項數字；

（二）有否就過去數年的學生輕生個案進行詳細研究，並分析其成因；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於政府自二○二三年於中學推行「三層應急機制」，以及早識別及支援有較高輕生風險的學生，現時每層機制所涉及的個案數目為何；鑑於二○二五年《施政報告》提出將該機制擴展至在小學四至六年級試行，具體的推行時間表為何，以及會否考慮將其進一步擴展至初小，並增加學校社工、訓輔教師的比例，同時加強家校合作？

答覆：

主席：

教育局非常重視學生的身心健康，積極為學校提供支援，協助學校採用全校參與模式，以「普及性」、「選擇性」、「針對性」三個層面，照顧學生的精神健康，並且與其他政策局／部門和不同持份者合作，以跨部門、跨專業及跨界別合作，透過優化課程、資訊、活動、培訓及專業支援等，促進學生全人發展，以及加強支援有精神健康需要，包括有高輕生風險的學生。就陸頌雄議員提出的問題，教育局經諮詢醫務衞生局（醫衞局）、勞工及福利局（勞福局）及社會福利署（社署），現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）教育局一直要求中、小學匯報學生懷疑輕生身亡個案，以便向有關學校提供合適的專業支援，但沒有強制學校呈報曾試圖或有計劃輕生的學生個案，亦沒有收集大學生懷疑輕生身亡的個案。過去三年，即二○二二至二○二四年），全港中、小學向教育局匯報的學生懷疑輕生身亡個案數字分別為25、32及28宗。在過去三年的個案當中，中學生佔總數約百分之九十三，而小學生個案則佔約百分之七。

二○一六年，政府成立防止學生自殺委員會（委員會），以全面了解學生輕生的問題。委員會的研究顯示，學生輕生行為是多方面的因素互相影響而成，包括精神健康問題、心理因素、人際關係、適應和學業壓力等。輕生是複雜的行為，每個個案發生的原因不盡相同，我們不能歸因於單一因素，例如有特殊教育需要或精神病，或簡化輕生的原因。

政府在二○一七年成立跨決策局／部門的防止青少年自殺工作小組，跟進青少年輕生問題，並檢視委員會提出的建議的落實情況，研究如何加強有關現有的措施和服務。另外，自二○一三年起，兒童死亡個案檢討委員會先後發布了六份報告，闡述關於兒童死亡個案（包括自殺等）個案的觀察和建議。政府會按需要適時進行相關研究，以加強支援的成效。

（三）政府透過教育局、醫衞局和社署的跨部門合作，由二○二三年十二月起在全港中學推行以學校為本的「三層應急機制」。教育局透過第一層機制為老師、家長和學生提供「守門人」訓練，裝備他們及早識別和應對有較高輕生風險的學生。截至二○二五年八月三十一日，社署的「校外支援網絡」隊伍透過第二層機制共接獲418宗學校轉介個案，而醫院管理局精神科透過「三層應急機制」共接獲444宗校長轉介個案和173宗電話諮詢。《行政長官2025年施政報告》宣布政府會恆常化在中學實施的第三層機制，並且擴展至在小學四至六年級試行，我們會密切留意機制的運作情況，適時檢視機制的相關安排。

另外，自二○二四年開始，教育局與警務處及社署合作，在家長／監護人的同意下，警方會轉介在校外企圖輕生的學生到就讀的學校或由社署安排合適的社會服務單位接受跟進服務。即使家長不同意學生接受轉介，警方亦會為學生及家長／監護人提供尋求支援或求助的資料，盡力為有關學生及家長／監護人提供支援。

就支援有精神健康需要的學生，學校設有不同範疇的專業人員，包括學校社工、學生輔導人員、校本教育心理學家等，為有需要的學生提供適切的支援，也為家長提供諮詢服務。

教育局亦由二○一八／一九學年起在公營小學推行「一校一社工」政策，並發放額外津貼，以資助學校購買諮詢、督導或其他支援學校社工的相關服務。中學方面，為提升青少年精神健康及抗壓能力，社署自二○一九／二○學年起實行「一校兩社工」政策，以加強對學校社工在處理複雜個案方面的督導支援。社署亦於二○二一／二二學年起為全港中學學校社會工作服務增加支援人手，協助學校社工處理行政工作及推行活動，讓學校社工能為有需要的學生提供更深入的輔導及小組活動。

由於全校參與的模式及跨專業協作能提供全面的學生輔導及支援服務，現時每所學校已有跨專業團隊，加上目前為學校提供的社工人手、校外支援，以及發放津貼的安排一方面保障學校能提供具專業質素的服務，另一方面能給予學校充足的資源和彈性購買額外的輔導服務，政府暫時無計劃在學校增加學校社工人手。我們會持續檢視及適當強化學校的輔導服務，促進學生的全人發展。

家長在支援子女的成長和學習方面非常重要。教育局在全港推行「正向家長運動」，並制訂《家長教育課程架構》，讓家長更有系統地學習培育子女所需的知識和技能。同時，為幫助家長及早識別及支援子女在精神健康方面的需要，教育局提供家長「守門人」訓練及增加主題式的家長教育課程，以多元模式與家長分享培育快樂及正向孩子的方法。教育局會繼續透過跨部門及跨界別合作，加強協同效應，與學校及家長攜手強化推廣學生精神健康的工作。

LCQ6: Supporting students with suicidal risk,2025-10-22 18:05,2025-10-22 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200529.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Luk Chung-hung and a reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

According to the data from the Education Bureau, over 130 school children committed suicide between 2020 and 2024. Furthermore, it has been reported that the number of primary and secondary students suffering from mental illness such as depression and anxiety disorders during the 2024/25 school year has significantly increased compared to five years earlier. On supporting students with suicidal risk, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of student suicide cases and attempted suicide cases in the past three years, and among them, the numbers of students with special educational needs or suffering from depression or anxiety disorders, together with a breakdown by age group of students, including those aged 0 to 6, 7 to 12, 13 to 18, and above 18 years old;

(2) whether it has conducted detailed studies on student suicide cases in recent years and analysed their causes; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as the Government has implemented the Three-tier School-based Emergency Mechanism in secondary schools since 2023 for early identification of and support for students with suicidal risk, of the number of cases currently involved in each tier of the mechanism; given that the 2025 Policy Address proposed that the mechanism will be extended on a trial basis to Primary Four to Six students, of the specific implementation timetable, and whether it will consider further extending it to lower primary students, increasing the ratio of school social workers as well as guidance and discipline teachers, while strengthening home-school collaboration?

Reply:

President,

The Education Bureau (EDB) attaches great importance to the physical and psychological health of students, and has been proactively providing support for schools in adopting the Whole School Approach at three levels, namely Universal, Selective and Indicated, to take care of students' mental health. We also collaborate with other policy bureaux/departments and different stakeholders to promote student's whole-person development and enhance support for students with mental health needs, including those with high suicidal risk, through cross-departmental, multi-disciplinary and cross-sector collaboration, optimising curriculum, information, activities, training and professional support, etc. In consultation with the Health Bureau (HHB), the Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Social Welfare Department (SWD), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Luk Chung-hung is as follows:

(1) and (2) The EDB has all along been requiring primary and secondary schools to report fatal suspected student suicide cases in order to provide appropriate professional support to the schools concerned. However, it is not mandatory for schools to report attempted or planned suicide cases of students, and the EDB does not collect information on fatal suspected suicide cases involving university students. In the past three years (i.e. 2022 to 2024), the number of fatal suspected student suicide cases reported by all primary and secondary schools in the territory to the EDB were 25, 32 and 28 respectively. Of the cases reported in the past three years, secondary students accounted for about 93 per cent, while primary students accounted for about seven per cent.

The Government set up the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides (the Committee) in 2016 to understand the issues of student suicides comprehensively. The study of the Committee revealed that students' suicidal behaviour was attributed to the interplay of multiple factors including mental health issues, psychological factors, relationship, adjustment and academic stress. Suicide is a complicated behaviour, the reasons for each case are not the same, so we should not attribute any case to a single factor, such as special educational needs or mental illness, or simplify the reasons of suicide.

The Government set up a cross policy bureaux/departments Task Force on Prevention of Youth Suicides in 2017 to follow up on youth suicide issues and review the progress of implementing the recommendations put forward by the Committee, and explore the possible ways of enhancing existing measures and services. In addition, since 2013, the Child Fatality Review Panel has published six reports setting out its observations and recommendations pertaining to the child fatality cases, including suicide. The Government will conduct relevant research in an opportune time when necessary to enhance the effectiveness of the support measures.

(3) Through cross-departmental collaboration of the EDB, the HHB, and the SWD, the Government has implemented the Three-tier School-based Emergency Mechanism (the Mechanism) in all secondary schools since December 2023. Under the first-tier of the Mechanism, the EDB provides gatekeeper training for teachers, parents, and students so as to equip them to early identify and handle students at higher suicidal risk. As at August 31, 2025, the off-campus support network teams engaged by SWD have received a total of 418 case referrals from schools under the second-tier of the Mechanism, while the Hospital Authority's psychiatry specialist services received a total of 444 referrals from principals and 173 telephone enquiries under the third-tier of the Mechanism. ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that the Government would regularise the Mechanism in secondary schools and extend it on a trial basis to Primary Four to Six students. We will closely monitor the operation of the Mechanism and review the relevant arrangements of the Mechanism at an opportune time.

Besides, starting from 2024, the EDB has been collaborating with the Hong Kong Police Force (the Police) and the SWD, upon obtaining the consent of parents/guardians, the Police will refer students who attempted suicide outside schools to receive follow-up services by the students' attending schools or appropriate social services units arranged by the SWD. To make every effort to support the students and parents/guardians concerned, the Police will provide them with information for seeking support or assistance even if the parents decline the referral.

For the support for students with mental health needs, schools are staffed with professionals of different disciplines, including school social workers, student guidance personnel, and school-based educational psychologists, to provide students in need with appropriate support and parents with consultation services.

The EDB has also implemented the ""one school social worker for each school"" policy in public sector primary schools since the 2018/19 school year, and provided additional grants for schools to purchase consultation, supervision or other related services to support school social workers. For secondary schools, to enhance youth's mental health and resilience, the SWD has implemented the measure of ""two school social workers for each school"" since the 2019/20 school year and enhanced supervisory support for handling complicated cases. The SWD has also strengthened the supporting manpower for school social work services in secondary schools across the territory since the 2021/22 school year, with a view to assisting school social workers in handling administrative work and implementing activities to enable school social workers to provide students in need with more intensive counselling and group activity services.

In view that comprehensive student guidance and support services are provided through the Whole School Approach and cross-disciplinary collaboration, and each school has already set up a cross-disciplinary team, along with the current provision of social workers for schools, external support, and funding arrangement, ensuring that schools can deliver services with professional quality while also providing them with sufficient resources and flexibility to hire or procure additional guidance services, the Government has no plan to increase the number of school social workers. We will continue to review and strengthen school guidance services as appropriate to promote students' whole-person development.

Parents play a crucial role in supporting children's development and learning. The EDB has been implementing the territory-wide Positive Parent Campaign and developed the Curriculum Frameworks on Parent Education to enable parents to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills for nurturing their children in a more systematic manner. Furthermore, to help parents early identify and support their children's mental health needs, the EDB provides parent gatekeeper training and more thematic parent education programmes to share with parents ways to raise happy and positive children in a diversified mode. The EDB will continue to strengthen the synergy through cross-departmental and cross-sector collaboration, work closely with schools and parents to enhance the efforts in the promotion of student mental health.

Thank you, President."
"Local premiere this evening of animation film ""Another World"" financed by Film Development Fund",2025-10-22 18:04,2025-10-22 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200603.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Film Development Council (HKFDC):

The local premiere of an animation film with funding support from the Film Production Financing Scheme (FPFS) under the Film Development Fund (FDF), ""Another World"", will be held this evening (October 22).

   ""Another World"", a Hong Kong-made animation film, is directed by Tommy Ng, written by Polly Yeung, produced by Polly Yeung and Chan Gin-kai, with voices performed by Chung Suet-ying, Choi Hiu-tung, Louis Cheung, Kay Tse, Will Or and Yeung Nga-man. In ""Another World"", the spirit guide Gudo, who shepherds lost souls to their reincarnation, encounters Yuri, a young girl cursed by an obsession. To save Yuri from uncontrollable rage and prevent her curse from destroying the world, Gudo embarks on a perilous thousand-year journey.

   ""Another World"" originated and is premiered with the funding and support from the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau. In 2019, the production team of ""Another World"" was granted a subsidy under the Animation Support Program, a project funded by CCIDA through the CreateSmart Initiative, to initiate the production of the short version of ""Another World"". Subsequently, the team received a subsidy from the FPFS under the FDF to bring director Ng's first animation feature film to fruition, paving the way for the film's global premiere at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in France in June this year.

Earlier, producer and screenwriter Polly Yeung participated in the 81st Venice International Film Festival in Italy and the 78th Cannes Film Festival in France as part of the delegation led by the HKFDC, where she attended various producer matching activities to increase publicity for ""Another World"" and seek opportunities for overseas distribution of the film. The film has been selected for several international film festivals, including the 21st Zurich Film Festival in Switzerland, the competition section of the 58th Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival in Spain, the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival 2025 and the ""Hidden Dragon"" section of the 9th Pingyao International Film Festival. It has also received multiple nominations, including Best Animated Film at the 18th Asia Pacific Screen Awards, as well as Best Animated Feature, Best Original Film Score and Best Adapted Screenplay at the 62nd Golden Horse Awards. The film will be theatrically released in Hong Kong on October 29.

The Chairman of the HKFDC, Dr Wilfred Wong, congratulated ""Another World"" on gaining world-wide recognition, adding that the global appreciation received by the film gave the Hong Kong animation industry a shot in the arm. Since the launch of the FPFS in 2007, the HKFDC has funded 70 films, including three animated films. With CCIDA's support over the years and the dedicated efforts of the production team, ""Another World"" has garnered the attention of esteemed international animation film festivals, proving Hong Kong filmmakers' ability to produce high-quality animation films. Dr Wong sincerely hopes for a bright future for Hong Kong animated films and is looking forward to more high-quality animation films to be shown in theatres."

問題：

行政長官早前指出，截至今年七月底，註冊香港本地公司總數逾150萬間，註冊非香港公司逾15 000間，兩項數字均創歷史新高。此外，自二○二三年一月至今年七月，投資推廣署已協助1 333間企業在香港開設或擴展業務，引入1,740億元首年直接投資，並創造逾19 000個新增職位。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（二）鑑於註冊非香港公司的數字創歷史新高，政府會如何善用此優勢，制訂中長期規劃，以持續推動總部經濟發展，包括推出具體措施協助來港企業「走出去」；及

（三）鑑於有商界人士反映，境外企業來港開展業務後面對不少困難和挑戰，包括辦公室成本高、國際人才流失、資金調動困難等問題，政府就此有何應對策略，包括會否考慮在北部都會區劃出土地設立「總部經濟專區」，協助該等來港企業落戶，並促進其與粵港澳大灣區其他內地城市保持緊密聯繫？

答覆：

主席：

就蘇長荣議員的提問，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）後，我綜合回應如下：

截至今年九月底，根據《公司條例》註冊的本地公司及非香港公司總數分別達1 519 103間及15 614間，兩項數字均創歷史新高。

此外，根據投資推廣署及政府統計處共同進行的按年統計調查，二○二四年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司總數達9 960間，亦創歷史新高。其中包括1 410間地區總部，2 410間地區辦事處和6 140間當地辦事處。按來源地分析，首五位是中國內地（2 620間）、日本（1 430間）、美國（1 390間）、英國（720間）及新加坡（520間）。按在香港的主要業務範圍分析，首五位是進出口貿易、批發及零售業（4 730間）、金融及銀行業（2 020間）、專業、商用及教育服務業（1 530間）、運輸、倉庫及速遞服務業（730間）及資訊科技服務業（500間）。

在二○二三年至今年九月期間，投資推廣署已協助共超過1 400間中國內地及海外企業在港開設或擴展業務，預計帶來約1,940億元直接投資金額和創造20 000多個就業機會，亦提早完成二○二二年《施政報告》訂下的績效指標（註）。

上述豐碩的成果除了充分顯示特區政府的招商引資工作取得成效，亦反映儘管受地緣政治的影響，中國內地和海外企業依然對香港充滿信心，並選擇香港作為其拓展亞洲區域業務的基地。二○二五年《施政報告》亦定下新績效指標，要求在二○二六至二○二七年間吸引至少共1 200間中國內地或海外企業在港開設或擴展業務，從而帶來至少1,200億元直接投資金額和創造至少12 000個就業機會。投資推廣署會繼續積極部署及吸引香港境外的企業及資金落戶香港。

就企業落戶香港時遇到困難，投資推廣署致力為它們提供一站式及量身訂製的支援服務，由策劃至落實業務全程給予協助。為加強支援企業應對困難和挑戰，在財政司司長的支持下，投資推廣署在去年成立由投資推廣署署長領導的跨部門／機構轉介機制，由署方積極收集和研究中國內地及海外企業在落戶香港時面對的關注和痛點，以便向相關政策局、部門或機構反映和商討適切方案。轉介機制設立近一年以來，成功處理了多項事宜以配合業界需要（例如開設銀行戶口、外來勞工的申請和工作安排、申請使用空置土地等），以便利中國內地及海外企業落戶香港和擴展業務。

在推動總部經濟方面，政府會善用香港作為國際金融中心的獨特優勢，吸引更多中國內地以至世界各地企業在港設立財資中心。就此，二○二五年《施政報告》指出，財庫局正研究優化相關的稅務寬減措施，目標於明年上半年完成有關研究。香港金融管理局亦會推動銀行業，尤其中國內地銀行，在港設立區域總部，利用香港優勢，輻射開拓東南亞和中東等地區市場，提供更全面的跨境金融方案。

另外，公司遷冊機制已在二○二五年五月二十三日開始實施，在香港以外地區成立的公司可向公司註冊處申請遷冊來港。該機制可減省複雜昂貴的司法程序，讓經遷冊公司保留其在法律上的法人團體身分，令公司業務得以延續。遷冊申請人須符合公司背景、誠信、對成員及債權人的保障和償付能力等規定。

為吸引高增值產業和高潛力企業落戶香港，二○二五年《施政報告》宣布，財政司司長會帶領相關政策局、部門及公營機構，制訂促進產業和投資的優惠政策包，涵蓋批地、地價、資助或稅務減免優惠等。投資推廣署和引進重點企業辦公室可靈活運用政策包，與企業洽談落戶細節，並向財政司司長匯報，由其拍板落實。此舉同時配合推動北部都會區的產業發展，以主動吸引高增值產業和高潛力企業來港，推動香港經濟高質量發展。

在支援中國內地企業「出海」方面，二○二五年《施政報告》宣布特區政府會整合香港的外地辦事處，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局（貿發局）和香港駐中國內地的辦事處，組成一站式平台和成立內地企業出海專班（出海專班），主動招攬中國內地企業利用香港平台「出海」。商務及經濟發展局局長負責督導出海專班工作及協調各政策局（包括財庫局）、部門和機構，為「出海」企業制訂多元方案。投資推廣署會協調支援出海專班的工作，並透過貿發局及與其他機構的協作，利用多元渠道與中國內地中小企業對接，向目標企業宣傳以香港為「出海」平台的優勢，並按不同企業的需要量身訂製全方位支援服務。

我們已於十月六日和十四日分別正式啓動出海專班和舉行首次督導委員會會議討論工作策略。接下來，出海專班將陸續開展不同工作，包括於中國內地舉辦大型推廣活動，以宣傳專班的工作。

展望未來，投資推廣署會繼續配合相關政策局，一方面向海外企業推廣香港作為拓展中國內地業務的跳板並支援它們落戶香港，推動總部經濟和發展北部都會區，另一方面向中國內地企業推廣香港作為「出海」的平台並協助它們來港設立業務，並與出海專班的工作有機結合，進一步驅動「引進來、走出去」的雙向投資。

註：二○二二年《施政報告》的績效指標要求於二○二三年至二○二五年吸引至少1 130間企業在港開設或擴展業務，從而帶來不少於770億元直接投資金額和創造不少於15 250個就業機會。"

(2) given that the number of registered non-Hong Kong companies has hit a record high, how the Government will leverage this advantage to formulate medium and long-term planning so as to continuously promote the development of headquarters economy, including implementing specific measures to assist companies set up in Hong Kong in ""going global""; and

(3) given that some members of the business sector have relayed that non-Hong Kong enterprises have been facing numerous difficulties and challenges after setting up business in Hong Kong, including high premises costs, loss of international talents and difficulty in capital deployment, of the corresponding strategies adopted by the Government to address the issues, including whether it will consider designating land in the Northern Metropolis to establish a ""designated zone for headquarters economy"" so as to assist incoming enterprises in establishing a presence in Hong Kong and facilitate them to maintain close liaison with other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area?

Reply:

President,

 In response to Dr the Hon So Cheung-wing's question, after consulting the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB), my consolidated response is as follows:

 As at the end of September this year, the total number of local companies and non-Hong Kong companies registered under the Companies Ordinance reached 1 519 103 and 15 614 respectively, both of which were all-time high figures.

 Besides, according to the annual survey jointly conducted by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) and the Census and Statistics Department, the number of companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside Hong Kong also reached a record high level of 9 960 in 2024, including 1 410 regional headquarters, 2 410 regional offices and 6 140 local offices. Analysed by place of origin, the top five were the Chinese Mainland (2 620 companies), Japan (1 430 companies), the United States of America (1 390 companies), the United Kingdom (720 companies) and Singapore (520 companies). Analysed by major line of business in Hong Kong, the top five were import/export trade, wholesale and retail (4 730 companies), financing and banking (2 020 companies), professional, business and education services (1 530 companies), transportation, storage and courier services (730 companies) and information technology services (500 companies).

 From 2023 to September this year, InvestHK assisted over 1 400 Chinese Mainland and overseas enterprises to set up or expand businesses in Hong Kong. They are expected to bring in direct investment of around $194 billion and create over 20 000 job opportunities. InvestHK has completed in advance the key performance indicator (KPI) (Note) as set out in the 2022 Policy Address.

 The above-mentioned fruitful results not only fully demonstrate the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's investment promotion achievements, but also reflect that Chinese Mainland and overseas enterprises continue to have full confidence in Hong Kong and have selected Hong Kong as their base to expand regional businesses in Asia despite geopolitical impact. In the 2025 Policy Address, the new KPI is to attract at least 1 200 Chinese Mainland or overseas enterprises to set up or expand businesses in Hong Kong between 2026 and 2027, thereby bringing in direct investment of at least $120 billion and creating at least 12 000 job opportunities. InvestHK will continue to plan and attract proactively non-local enterprises and capital to come to Hong Kong.

 Regarding difficulties encountered by enterprises when setting foot in Hong Kong, InvestHK is dedicated to offering them one-stop customised support services, from planning to implementation stages. To strengthen support for enterprises to cope with their difficulties and challenges, InvestHK set up last year, with the support of the Financial Secretary, an inter-departmental/agency referral mechanism led by the Director-General of Investment Promotion. By proactively collecting and analysing Chinese Mainland and overseas enterprises' concerns and pain points when they plan to establish presence in Hong Kong, InvestHK reflects them to relevant bureaux, departments or agencies accordingly for exploring suitable solutions as appropriate. Since the establishment of the mechanism around a year ago, various issues have been successfully addressed to meet the needs of the trade, including opening of bank accounts, application and work arrangements for imported workers, application for use of vacant land, thereby assisting Chinese Mainland and overseas enterprises to set up and expand their businesses in Hong Kong.

 As for promoting headquarters economy, the Government will capitalise on the unique advantages of Hong Kong as an international financial centre to attract more enterprises from the Chinese Mainland and around the world to establish corporate treasury centres in Hong Kong. In this regard, as pointed out in the 2025 Policy Address, the FSTB is conducting a study on tax concessionary measures to be further enhanced, and targets to complete the study in the first half of next year. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority will also encourage the banking sector, especially banks in the Chinese Mainland, to establish regional headquarters in Hong Kong, where Hong Kong's strengths can help them expand into Southeast Asian and the Middle East markets, thereby providing more comprehensive cross-boundary financial solutions.

 In addition, the company re-domiciliation regime commenced on May 23, 2025. A company incorporated outside Hong Kong may apply to the Company Registry for re-domiciliation to Hong Kong. The regime reduces the need to go through complicated and costly judicial procedures, and enables a re-domiciled company to maintain its legal identity as a body corporate, thereby ensuring business continuity. An applicant for company re-domiciliation is required to fulfil requirements concerning company background, integrity, member and creditor protection, solvency, etc.

 As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, the Financial Secretary will lead the relevant policy bureaux, departments and public organisations in formulating packages of preferential policies, including land grants, land premium, financial subsidies and tax incentives, to attract high value-added industries and high-potential enterprises to set up in Hong Kong. InvestHK and the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises can flexibly use the policy packages during negotiations with enterprises on settlement details, and then report to the Financial Secretary for approval. This will, at the same time, tie in the industry development of the Northern Metropolis, for proactively attracting high value-added industries and high-potential enterprises to set up in Hong Kong, thereby promoting high-quality development of Hong Kong's economy.

 On supporting Chinese Mainland enterprises in going global, the 2025 Policy Address announced the establishment of a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong offices abroad, including those under InvestHK and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC), as well as Hong Kong offices in the Chinese Mainland, and setup of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force) to encourage Chinese Mainland enterprises to use Hong Kong as a platform to go global. The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development steers the work of the GoGlobal Task Force and coordinates various bureaux (including the FSTB), departments and agencies in formulating diverse proposals for enterprises looking to go global. InvestHK will coordinate and support the work by the GoGlobal Task Force, and through collaboration with the HKTDC and other agencies, engage with small and medium-sized enterprises from the Chinese Mainland, promoting to target enterprises Hong Kong's advantages as a go global platform by various channels and providing them with comprehensive and customised support services based on their needs.

 On October 6 and 14, we officially launched the GoGlobal Task Force and convened the first meeting of the Steering Committee for the GoGlobal Task Force to discuss work strategies respectively. Going forward, the GoGlobal Task Force will commence various aspects of work progressively, including organising large-scale promotional events in the Chinese Mainland to promote work of the GoGlobal Task Force.

 Looking ahead, InvestHK will continue to work with relevant policy bureaux. On the one hand, it will promote Hong Kong as a springboard for overseas businesses for accessing the Chinese Mainland market, and support them to establish presence here so as to promote headquarters economy and develop the Northern Metropolis. On the other hand, it will also promote Hong Kong to Chinese Mainland enterprises as a go global launchpad and assist them in setting up their businesses in Hong Kong. The efforts will also be organically integrated into the work of the GoGlobal Task Force, thereby enhancing two-way investment (viz. attracting investment inflows to Hong Kong and facilitating further investment beyond Hong Kong).

Note: The KPI in the 2022 Policy Address requires attracting at least a total of 1 130 enterprises to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong from 2023 to 2025, thereby bringing in direct investment of at least $77 billion and creating at least 15 250 job opportunities."
立法會：環境及生態局局長就「改革滲水問題處理機制」議員議案總結發言（只有中文）,2025-10-22 17:31,2025-10-22 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200600.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議就陳恒鑌議員動議的「改革滲水問題處理機制」議案的總結發言：

主席：

我再次感謝陳恒鑌議員提出這次議案辯論和剛才各位議員的寶貴意見。

優化滲水檢測程序先導計劃

首先，我感謝有不少議員在行政長官發表《施政報告》後，以及在剛才的發言中對推行優化滲水檢測程序的先導計劃表示支持。正如我在開場發言時指出，樓宇出現滲水問題主要是因為業主未有妥善維修和保養其樓宇。業主若能第一時間履行其責任，與受影響的單位溝通，並跟進滲水情況，即時安排維修，滲水問題便可早日解決。這正是政府推出先導計劃的背後理念。

根據聯辦處（滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處）的過往經驗，滲水問題主要由上層單位引致。因此，在先導計劃下，我們只要利用科技確定滲水情況，便會要求上層業主在指定時間內自行進行檢查和安排維修，否則聯辦處會介入，採取進一步行動，詳細檢測，並向其收回檢測費用，這個做法可促使上層的業主盡快採取行動，進行維修，不需等待政府詳細調查的結果。

為配合先導計劃的推行，發展局和環境及生態局會為有需要的業主提供資訊和財政支援，協助上層單位業主自行進行檢測及解決滲水糾紛。資訊方面，政府計劃與專業團體合作提供有關滲水檢測及維修的「懶人包」等資訊，上載至聯辦處、屋宇署和食環署（食物環境衞生署）的網頁，供市民參考。財政支援方面，發展局會透過現行計劃向業主提供資助或貸款。

我們亦會加強宣傳工作，加深市民對樓宇滲水問題的認識。現時，食環署就每個滲水個案均設有個案經理，並已另外成立顧客服務小組，透過舉辦宣傳活動及講座，向市民及物業管理業界推廣樓宇滲水知識，以及業主的維修和管理責任。

聯辦處亦已設立滲水事宜資源中心，向公眾提供滲水的一般資訊及參考資料。顧客服務小組職員會向到訪中心或致電查詢的市民，解答滲水事宜的一般查詢。此外，公眾人士亦可瀏覽滲水事宜專題網頁取得資訊。

社區調解先導計劃

另一方面，政府積極鼓勵市民以調解方式解決滲水問題和加強物業管理公司（物管公司）協助處理的角色。我在開場發言中提到的社區調解先導計劃正是其中一個例子。先導計劃為物管人員提供調解技巧培訓，以加強他們的調解能力，處理業戶之間的滲水事宜。培訓課程結合實務知識講座和角色扮演訓練，內容涵蓋調解基礎知識和運用調解技巧促進糾紛解決，以助物管人員能夠在第一時間介入協助處理滲水問題，充分發揮作為居民面對糾紛時的橋樑，改善溝通並促進社區和諧。

政府會持續檢視培訓成效，並會加強與物業管理業監管局（監管局）的合作，探討進一步加強物管公司在參與處理樓宇滲水的角色的可行性。

我很高興監管局剛於上星期四，即十月十六日，推出「處理物業滲水情況」良好作業指南（指南），向物管公司提供實務指引，並擬於十月二十七日在監管局舉辦的持續專業發展講座中介紹指南。屆時，食環署亦會參與講解處理滲水的工作，讓物管公司更有效地協助處理物業內的滲水事宜。

剛才有議員提出有不同成因引致滲水情況，如滲水情況構成衞生妨擾，聯辦處會根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》作出跟進。如滲水情況是由其他成因引致，如雨水經大廈天台、平台、露台、外牆或窗戶滲入而引致對樓宇安全構成風險，例如天花混凝土剝落、鋼筋銹蝕等，或滲漏與樓宇的雨水渠管或污水渠管等排水渠管失修有關，聯辦處會將個案轉介屋宇署，屋宇署可根據《建築物條例》處理。如發現供水喉管失修而引致浪費供水的情況，聯辦處會轉介水務署根據《水務設施條例》處理。

為了進一步便利食環署處理樓宇滲水導致公共衞生妨擾的個案，我們亦修訂了《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章），訂明單位業戶如沒有合理辯解而不遵從「擬進入處所通知書」，即屬罪行，修訂條例亦延長政府人員可登門調查的時段至下午十時，配合市民的生活便利進行調查，這些修訂亦已在今年八月生效。

總結

主席，本屆政府明白市民對樓宇滲水問題的關注。因此，政府從不同方面提升處理樓宇滲水的效率和成效，包括科技、修改法例、推動調解，亦將於明年落實優化滲水檢測程序的先導計劃。政府會持續探討不同可行措施，以協助市民盡快解決樓宇滲水問題。我謹此陳辭。"
立法會主席年結記者會發言全文（只有中文）,2025-10-22 17:28,2025-10-22 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200560.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會主席梁君彥今日（十月二十二日）在立法會年結記者會上的開場發言全文：

我今天與大家回顧第七屆立‍法會的工作。

序言

在國家的堅實支持下，今屆立法會是完善選舉制度、落實「愛國者治港」原則後產生的首屆立法會。立法會與行政當局開創了良性互動的新格局，成功扭轉過去多年內耗不斷的困局，重回理性務實的正軌。今屆立法會議員奮發有為，高質高效審議多項重要法案，成果豐碩，充分彰顯議員的擔‍當。

因此，我會以「志不求易，事不避難，建言有為、實幹有成」來總結今屆立法會的表現，是香港「由亂到治」、「由治及興」的重要折點。

議事工作重點

就二○二五年會期來說，立法會共通過了41項政府法案和兩項議員法案，均對香港經濟發展、改善民生起着重要作用，部分更是動手處理香港的「老大難」問題，審議難度一點也不‍小，包括：


規管「簡樸房」制度，取締劣質「劏房」；
規管網約車服務；
推行新控煙措施，打擊私煙、禁售加味煙等，保障市‍民健康。


完成審議的法案亦包括極具爭議的《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》。議員充分聆聽社會各界意見，同時考慮傳統價‍值觀和社會整體利益，最後的投票結果反映了主流民意。法案雖然未能通過，但整個過程公開透明，議員各抒己見，同時彰顯法治精神，體現了行政主導下，行政、立法和司法機關各司其職、互相尊重、互相制衡。

綜合今屆立法會四年會期，我們一共舉行了135次會議，合共約1 246小時。通‍過的法案多達130‍項‍，比上屆同期的81項多出超過六成。

在通過的法案中，重中之重當然是去年三月十九日，全體議員全票三讀通過的《維護國家安全條例草案》，成功為《基‍本法》第二十三條立法，履行延擱了超過26年的憲制責‍任。這項法例與《香港國安法》共同構建「雙法雙機制」，堵塞了特區維護國家安全的缺口，讓香港可以全力聚焦拼‍經‍濟、謀發展。

本屆立法會亦通過了多項配合行政長官施政方針的重‍要法案，包括：


精簡地契續期機制，鞏固了業權人和投資者對香港長‍遠發展的信心；銀行提供長期的按揭，令巿‍民置‍業更安心；
提供税務優惠，吸引更多有潛力的基金和家族辦‍公‍室落戶香港；
完善税務安排，強化香港區域知識產權貿易中心的競爭力。


另外，亦通過了多項聚焦改善民生的法案，包括：


重塑區議會，完善地區治理；
設立強制舉報虐兒機制；
落實「三隧分流」；
取消強積金「對沖」。


這些法案均「貼地到位」，惠澤市民。議員審議法案時，嚴謹地審議每一項條文，積極建言獻策，務求完善法案。事‍實上，在今屆立法會，政府就法案提出的修正案，有近一半是在吸納議員意見而提出。其中《維護國家安全條例草案》共‍有181項條文，政府提出了91項修正案，這些修正建議更全部來‍自法案委員會。這充分顯示行政機關從善如流，接納議員作為「民意代言人」的建議，而立法會就做到「配合不掣肘、監‍察不刁難」，這是行政立法良性互動的最佳示範！

附屬法例方面，今屆立法會共完成審議659項「先‍訂‍立、後審議」的附屬法例，包括今年五月完成審議根據《維護國家安全條例》訂立的兩項附屬法例，進一步完善維‍護國安制度；而政府動議了55項議案，以「先審議、後‍訂‍立」的程‍序，批准或修訂附屬法例，全部獲得立法會通‍過。

監察政府的措施方面，議員就政府工作提出了570項口‍頭質詢和3 292項補充質詢，以及1 890項書面質詢，內容均緊扣社會脈搏，與市民息息相關。

同時，這四年來立法會共辯論了165項無立法效力的議員議案，涉及推進北都發展、打造新經濟增長點，以及優‍化人口相關政策等議員就公眾關注的事項提出具體政‍策建‍議。

在「愛國者治港」原則和行政主導下，行政立法機‍關建立起多層次、全方位的機制。我很感謝行政長官屢創新猷，先後提出舉行「前廳交流會」和「行政長官互動交流答‍問會」，為行政立法交流進一步制度化，好讓議員將匯聚得‍來的民意，直接更有效向行政長官及官員反映。不少具體、前‍瞻性和實效的建議，已獲行政長官《施政報告》吸納，成‍為施政藍圖的一部分。

完善立法會議員履職機制

作為香港特區管治團隊的重要一員，立法會工作任重道遠。議員本着「沒有最好，只有更好」的宗旨，自覺要以更‍高標準加強自我監管，完善履職機制，以回應國家和香港社‍會對立法會越來越高的期望。因此，全體議員總結經驗，制‍定了《立法會議員守則》（《守則》）。這《守則》將於下屆立法會實施，將提高議員表現的透明度和問責性，提供更清晰的履職依‍據，有助議員更高效履職，立法會更好發揮憲制職能，協助香港特區政府提升治理水平。

職務考察

今屆立法會致力「內聯外通」，促進香港與內地及其他地區各方面的聯繫交流，既致力融入國家發展大局，亦‍配合國家睦鄰友‍好、深化「一帶一路」等策略。

立法會代表團曾出訪大灣區、福建、東盟三國及日本，轄下多個委員會亦曾到內地多個城市進行職務考察。對‍內‍地，聚焦創科、青年發展和跨境醫療等領域；對海外，着‍眼於加強經貿合作、人文交匯、發展旅遊、說好國家和香‍港故‍事。此外，我亦多次邀請各國領事到立法會與議員聚會交‍流，擴大香港的朋友圏，加強探‍索新的合作機遇。

結語

各位傳媒朋友，我出任立法會議員已有21年。自二○一六年起擔任立法會主席，見證到「由亂到治」，「由治及興」的新境‍界。能夠與一眾議員並肩作戰、與行政當局攜手同心、與廣大市‍民同頻共振、風雨同舟，我感到無比光榮，亦由衷感恩，我‍一‍定銘記於心。

我亦要借此機會，衷心感謝立法會秘書處一直提供的專業支援和意見，確保立法會暢順運作。

香港作為國際金融中心，亦是國家唯一實行普通法的司法管轄區。我們的法治傳統、人才流、資金流、中西文化交融，均是無可替代的競爭力，亦是香港在國家發展中應發‍揮的獨特作用。「一國兩制」是香港保持長期繁榮穩定、貢‍獻國家和世界的最佳制度安排，必須長期堅持。這不僅是中央政府的諄諄囑咐，更是所有立法會議員應‍當盡‍心盡‍力的實踐方向。

作為「民意代言人」，議員必須以香港整體利益為依歸，更好對接國家發展策略。我深信，「以民為本，上下一心」，這份使命一定會在新一屆立法會薪火相傳，延續下去。

第八屆立法會換屆選舉提名期本星期五便開始。我鼓‍勵愛‍國愛港、有志服務社會的賢能人士積極參選。我呼籲選民在‍十二月七日踴躍投票，選出德才兼備的立法會議員服務香港，貢獻國家。"

"DH conducts operation ""Thunderstone"" to crack down on illegal sale of alternative smoking products (with photo)",2025-10-22 17:23,2025-10-22 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200579.htm,"The Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health (DH) conducted an enforcement operation codenamed ""Thunderstone"" today (October 22) to crack down on the illegal sale of alternative smoking products (ASPs). One person was stopped for investigation and 600 suspected ASPs were seized.

During routine online patrols in recent days, TACO officers discovered suspected illegal online sales of alternative smoking products. As such, TACO conducted an operation today by posing as customers and stopped for investigation a 24-year-old man in Kowloon Bay on suspicion of illegally selling ASPs. A total of 600 suspected ASPs were seized. Charges will be laid against the suspect if sufficient evidence is found.

The Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371) prohibits the promotion, manufacture, sale and possession for commercial purposes of ASPs. Offenders are subject to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months.

TACO reminded members of the public not to use any ASPs, emphasising that these products are addictive and not effective tools for quitting smoking. In addition, ASPs can increase the risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. The Government appeals to smokers to quit smoking as early as possible for their own health and that of others. They are encouraged to call the DH's Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline on 1833 183. The hotline is operated by registered nurses and provides professional counselling services on smoking cessation. Information on smoking cessation can also be obtained from www.livetobaccofree.hk."

十月份第四批涵蓋九個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及十個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共四批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共32個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這32個監察區中，24個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有八區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

（二）是否知悉，過去五年醫院管理局（醫管局）轄下藥物建議委員會就評估新藥物納入《藥物名冊》的申請的以下資料：

（i）接獲的新藥申請宗數；

（ii）獲准納入《藥物名冊》的新藥名稱；

（iii）獲准納入《藥物名冊》的藥物申請數目所佔的百分比；

（iv）不批准新藥納入《藥物名冊》的主要原因；及

（v）由收到申請至完成審批程序的平均所需天數；申請未能獲批後重新申請的流程，以及相關程序的平均所需時間；

（三）是否知悉，藥物建議委員會有否就新藥審批制訂客觀及可量化的準則，以及會否推出措施以提升審批透明度，例如公開審批流程、評估指標的具體內容，以及決策機制的運作方式等；

（四）鑑於有意見指出，某些新藥可能涵蓋多種適應症，政府會否設立靈活審批機制，放寬可用於治療多種適應症藥物的審批限制，使同一藥物可根據不同臨床證據，快速批准用於多個適應症；

（五）據悉越來越多市民選擇北上購買藥物，尤其是治療癌症的標靶藥物或罕見病藥物，政府會否考慮就市民北上買藥提供支援，例如與內地醫療機構合作，設立港人專屬藥物領取點或跨境送藥服務；及

（六）據悉內地在抗癌及罕見病藥物價格資訊方面高度透明，病人可透過網絡查閱官方藥品價目表，政府會否考慮參考有關做法，推動藥價公開化，例如在公立醫院率先試行公布藥品價格，使病人可作出知情選擇？

答覆：

主席：

醫療創新可為病人帶來「好藥港用、研發惠民」的好處。透過創新研發，市民可受惠於一些最先進、最有效和最新的藥物，而藥物註冊的數量增加亦可能減低醫療方面的財政壓力。二○二五年《施政報告》公布香港特別行政區（特區）政府會提速落實支持藥械的制度改革工作，鞏固香港作為國際醫療創新樞紐的地位，具體工作及時間表包括：

（1）於二○二六年內成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」（「香港藥械監管中心」），並提交立法建議以賦權中心監管中藥、西藥及醫療器械，致力成為國際認可藥械權威監管機構；

（2）優化現行的藥物審批和註冊制度，於二○二六年開始分階段實施「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制；

（3）加快「1+」新藥審批機制，包括試行優先審批經醫院管理局（醫管局）建議能應對治療嚴重或罕見疾病的創新藥；及

（4）於二○二六年向立法會提交規管醫療器械的立法建議，配合「香港藥械監管中心」的發展。

另一方面，政府大幅資助由醫管局轄下公營醫院提供的醫療服務（平均資助率為成本97%以上），以使市民不會因經濟原因而無法獲得適當的醫療服務。本港人口持續老化、慢性疾病日益普遍，醫療需求日益增加。為應對公營醫療服務需求增長，醫管局每年投放大量資源提供醫療服務及藥物，以高額資助方式為病人提供適切診治。為確保有限的公共醫療資源運用得宜，醫管局設有機制，以臨床實證為本為病人引進所需的新藥物治療，根據治療成效和成本效益將藥物加入醫管局藥物名冊（藥物名冊），同時監察藥物的使用及開支情況，務求謹慎使用。

就鄧家彪議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署和醫管局後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）根據《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章），藥劑製品必須符合安全、效能及素質標準，並獲得香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局（管理局）批准註冊，方可在香港銷售或分銷。藥劑製品的註冊申請人須根據管理局制定的《藥劑製品／物質註冊申請指南》提交所需文件。一般而言，若註冊的藥劑製品含有未曾在本港註冊的新藥劑或生物元素，註冊申請人需要根據管理局制定的《新藥劑或生物元素藥劑製品註冊申請指南》提供兩個或以上的指明參考地方的藥物規管機構發出的註冊證明文件，作為支持該產品已獲嚴謹的審批上市證據（即「第二層審批」）。

為優化藥物註冊制度及長遠推行「第一層審批」，政府已於二○二三年十一月一日推出「1+」機制，並於二○二四年十一月一日起擴大其適用範圍至所有新藥。含新藥劑或生物元素的藥劑製品，只要有本地臨床數據支持，且新藥的適用範圍經本地相關專家認可後，申請人只須提交一個（而非兩個或以上）參考藥物監管機構的許可，便可在香港申請註冊。

由二○二三年至二○二五年（截至九月三十日），管理局共審批252款含新藥劑或生物元素藥劑製品的註冊申請（二○二三年、二○二四年及二○二五年審批含新藥劑或生物元素藥劑製品的註冊申請分別為98、102及52款），而有關的申請人所提交的註冊證明文件，超過85%由內地、歐盟、美國、加拿大和澳洲的藥物監管機構所發出。「1+」機制自二○二三年十一日一日起實施後，管理局在此機制下共批准14款新藥的註冊申請（二○二三年、二○二四年及二○二五年經「1+」機制審批的註冊申請分別為兩、七及五款）。

（二）至（三）醫管局設有機制定期評估已獲註冊的新藥物，以及檢討藥物名冊內現有的藥物和安全網的涵蓋範圍，亦有機制評估醫療器械應否引入公營醫療系統。檢討過程以實證為本，考慮藥物的安全性、療效、成本效益和其他相關因素，包括國際間的建議和做法，以及專業意見等，務求以公平有效的方式運用公共資源，讓病人得到適切的治療。符合安全及有效性水平而能在本港正在改革的藥械監管制度下獲得註冊，並不代表藥械必然符合引入公營醫療服務的標準，特別是在引進創新藥物或醫療器械方面，公營醫療系統必須考慮整體資源運用優次及創新藥械成本效益，包括與現有醫療方案的比較，以善用有限的醫療資源。

新藥物的評估是持續進行的程序，須按照不斷演進的醫學證據、最新臨床發展和市場變化而進行。根據現行機制，醫管局藥物建議委員會會定期召開會議審理由醫生或藥廠提交的納入新藥申請。在過去五年（即二○二○至二一至二○二四至二五年度），共接獲264宗納入藥物名冊的新藥申請，其中116宗獲准納入藥物名冊，佔申請宗數超過四成，當中涉及的藥物詳列於附件。至於申請不獲納入藥物名冊的主要原因包括藥物名冊內已有其他替代藥物、沒有足夠實證以證明藥物的長遠療效或有明顯效用、缺乏足夠理據支持藥物治療的成本效益等。

因應醫療科技持續及迅速的發展步伐，以及大眾的期望不斷提升，醫管局自實施藥物名冊以來，一直持續完善藥物名冊的檢討機制，在檢討過程中加入更多持份者，以及提高議決藥物名冊的涵蓋範圍過程的透明度。具體而言，在處理新藥物或適應症的過程中，醫管局一直與各持份者保持緊密溝通，並通過不同途徑向持份者發布相關資訊，例如於藥物建議委員會召開會議前把會議議程和所討論的新藥物名單發送給病人團體，並於會議後發放審議結果（包括個別申請不獲納入藥物名冊的主要原因），以供參考。相關資訊亦會上載至醫管局的藥物名冊網頁。

醫管局沒有備存新藥物由收到申請至納入藥物名冊所需的時間。儘管如此，為加快把合適的新藥物納入藥物名冊，醫管局自二○二四年年底起簡化藥物名冊引入新藥的申請程序，醫生和藥廠可以直接向藥物建議委員會呈交入藥申請。而把新藥納入安全網的優次順序編配工作，亦會由每年兩次增至每年四次。配合上述新機制實施，醫管局積極優化藥物名冊引入新藥的程序，目標為將已獲實證有療效的新藥引入藥物名冊或安全網的資助範圍的所需時間減少一半，分別由原來的10個月減至五個月及由18個月縮短至九個月，讓病人可以盡快有新藥使用，亦可獲得安全網資助減輕藥費負擔。此外，醫管局會在二○二六上半年成立引進創新藥物及醫療器械辦公室，主動聯絡內地及其他地區有關的藥廠，促進創新藥物在香港註冊及納入藥物名冊。

醫管局會繼續密切留意治療各種疾病藥物的最新科研和臨床驗證，以確保病人可獲處方安全、有效和具成本效益的藥物，以及持續獲得適切的治療。

（四）同時涵蓋多種適應症的藥物就每種適應症的臨床實證累積受多種因素影響，同一藥物針對個別適應症在安全性、療效和成本效益方面的實證亦因而各有差異。正如前文所述，檢討藥物名冊的過程以實證為本，而基於同一藥物針對不同疾病的療效和成本效益可能不盡相同，醫管局會從循證醫學、公平有效使用公共資源、目標補助以及機會成本考慮的角度審議每項新藥物和適應症納入藥物名冊的申請，確保醫療資源聚焦應用於經嚴謹研究證實有效的治療。

（五）特區政府一直按照優勢互補、互利共贏的原則，在堅持有利於香港和內地醫療制度發展的大前提下，增加與粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）內地城市的醫療合作，以便利選擇在內地發展和生活的本港居民。其中，政府透過與大灣區內地城市合適的醫療機構合作，支援這些香港居民的醫療需要，例子包括「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」、「支援粵港澳大灣區醫院管理局病人先導計劃」，以及提出在「醫健通+」五年計劃中推出新功能，以便利市民保存和運用他們來自境內外的個人病歷紀錄。

香港與內地有各自的藥劑製品審批、註冊、進口及監管制度。其中，香港藥劑製品的進口受《進出口條例》（第60章）規管，凡進口此等物品都必須附有由工業貿易署署長授權衞生署所簽發的許可證。不過，如果是由進入香港境內的個人在其隨身行李之內攜帶合理數量的藥劑製品入境，而該等藥劑製品亦只是供其自用的話，則可獲豁免領取許可證。然而，這些沒有根據《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章）註冊的產品，未必符合本港對註冊藥劑製品的安全、素質和效能要求。

特區政府擔當保障香港市民健康的重要角色，會持續為香港市民提供優質的醫療服務，無意將責任轉移至內地醫療系統。因此政府目前沒有計劃特別就市民北上買藥提供支援。

（六）現時，醫管局藥物名冊中備有多種用以治療各種疾病的藥物，當中大部分類別的藥物均以政府高額資助下的標準收費提供予公立醫院病人使用。如醫生基於病人的臨床需要而建議病人選用高補貼服務範圍以外的自費藥物，醫生或藥劑部職員會告知病人其獲處方的藥物療程的費用，供病人考慮是否採用。

另一方面，現時醫管局絕大部分的常用藥物都是透過公開招標採購，為了保持採購資訊的高透明度，醫管局一直將有關藥物招標公告、中標者名稱、合約摘要、藥物總數量及合約總值等資訊於網上發布以供公眾查閱。然而，鑑於藥物價格屬商業敏感資料，為避免影響藥物採購的過程，以及醫管局購買藥物時的議價能力，醫管局不會披露購買個別藥物的單位價格。"
LCQ22: Provision of drugs to patients,2025-10-22 17:00,2025-10-22 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200507.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Tang Ka-piu and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  Some members of the community expect the Government to make more flexible and forward-looking arrangements for drug registration and the provision of drugs to patients. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of new drugs approved for registration in Hong Kong in each of the past three years, with a breakdown by the region where the drug regulatory authorities issuing documentary proofs of registration were located; among such new drugs, of the number of those registered under the ""1+"" mechanism for approval of new drug;

(2) whether it knows the following information on the assessment of applications for inclusion of new drugs in the Drug Formulary (the Formulary) by the Drug Advisory Committee under the Hospital Authority (HA) in the past five years:

(i) the number of new drug applications received;

(ii) the names of new drugs approved for inclusion in the Drug Formulary;

(iii) the percentage of drug applications approved for inclusion in the Formulary;

(iv) the main reasons for not approving the inclusion of new drugs in the Formulary; and

(v) the average number of days required from receipt of an application to completion of the approval process; the process for re-application after an application has failed to obtain approval, and the average time required for the relevant procedures;

(3) whether it knows if the Drug Advisory Committee has formulated objective and quantifiable criteria for approving new drugs, and whether it will introduce measures to enhance the transparency of the approval process, such as making public the approval process, the specific details of assessment indicators and the operation of the decision-making mechanism;

(4) as there are views pointing out that certain new drugs may cover multiple indications, whether the Government will establish a flexible approval mechanism to relax the approval restrictions on drugs that can be used for treating multiple indications, so that the same drug can be approved expeditiously for use in multiple indications based on different clinical evidence;

(5) as it is learnt that an increasing number of members of the public choose to go north to buy drugs, particularly targeted therapy drugs for treating cancer or rare disease drugs, whether the Government will consider providing support for members of the public to go north to buy drugs, such as partnering with Mainland medical institutions to set up dedicated drug collection points for Hong Kong people or introduce cross-boundary medication delivery services; and

(6) as it is learnt that the Mainland is highly transparent about the prices of anti-cancer and rare disease drugs, with patients able to check the official drug price lists online, whether the Government will consider making reference to the relevant practice to promote drug price transparency, such as piloting the publication of drug prices in public hospitals, so that patients can make informed choices?

Reply:

President,

  Medical innovation can bring the benefits of good drugs and research and development (R&D) to patients. Citizens may benefit from some of the most advanced, effective and up-to-date drugs through innovative R&D, while more drug registrations may also reduce financial pressures on healthcare. The 2025 Policy Address announced that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will accelerate the reform of the regulatory system of drugs and medical devices, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub. Specific initiatives and timelines include:

(a) setting up the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) in 2026 and submitting legislative proposal, thereby empowering the CMPR to regulate Chinese medicines, Western medicines and medical devices (medical products), with a view to establishing the CMPR as an internationally renowned regulatory authority for medical products;

(b) enhancing the prevailing evaluation, approval and registration mechanism for drugs and implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning in 2026;

(c) expediting the ""1+"" mechanism for new drugs, including piloting priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs recommended by the Hospital Authority (HA) for treatment of severe or rare diseases; and

(d) submitting a legislative proposal on regulating medical devices to the Legislative Council in 2026, dovetailing with the development of the CMPR.

  Meanwhile, the healthcare services provided at public hospitals under the HA are heavily subsidised by the Government (with an average subsidisation rate of over 97 per cent of the costs) to ensure that citizens are not denied adequate healthcare due to lack of means. With the persistently ageing population and growing prevalence of chronic diseases in Hong Kong, healthcare demand continues to escalate. To cope with the rising demand for public healthcare services, the HA allocates an enormous amount of resources annually to the provision of healthcare services and drugs in order to provide patients with optimal treatments with high subsidies. To ensure the appropriate use of limited public healthcare resources, the HA has put in place a mechanism to introduce new drugs for patients based on clinical evidence and include drugs, having regard to their cost-effectiveness and proven efficacy, in the HA Drug Formulary (HADF), while also monitoring the utilisation and expenditures of drugs in order to drive their prudent use.

  In consultation with the Department of Health (DH) and the HA, the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Tang Ka-piu is as follows:

(1) According to the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), pharmaceutical products must satisfy the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality for registration with approval from the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong (Board) before they can be sold or supplied in Hong Kong. Applicants for registration of pharmaceutical products are required to submit the necessary documents in accordance with the Guidance Notes on Registration of Pharmaceutical Products/Substances as promulgated by the Board. In general, applicants for registration of pharmaceutical product containing new chemical or biological entities (NCEs, i.e. containing active ingredients which have not been registered in Hong Kong) are required to, in accordance with the Guidance Notes on Registration of Pharmaceutical Products Containing a New Chemical or Biological Entity as promulgated by the Board, provide documentary proof for registration issued by at least two drug regulatory authorities of specified reference places in order to provide supporting evidence that relevant products have been rigorously evaluated before placing in the market (i.e. the ""secondary evaluation"" approach).

  To enhance the drug regulatory regime and implement the ""primary evaluation"" approach in the long run, the Government has launched on November 1, 2023 the ""1+"" mechanism for approval of new drugs and widened its applicability to all new drugs on November 1, 2024. For pharmaceutical products containing NCEs that are supported with local clinical data and scope of application recognised by local relevant expert, applicants concerned are only required to submit approval from one drug regulatory authority (instead of the two or more) to apply for registration in Hong Kong.

  From 2023 to 2025 (as at September 30), the Board approved a total of 252 applications for registration of pharmaceutical product containing NCEs (the number of applications for registration of pharmaceutical product containing NCEs approved in 2023, 2024 and 2025 were 98, 102, and 52 respectively), and over 85 per cent of documentary proof of the registration submitted by the relevant applicants were issued by drug regulatory authorities of the Mainland, the European Union, Australia, Canada and the United States. Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism on November 1, 2023, the Board has approved a total of 14 new drugs under this mechanism (two, seven and five products were approved in 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively).

(2) and (3) The HA has established mechanisms for regular evaluation of registered new drugs and review of the existing drugs listed in the HADF and the coverage of the safety net, as well as assessment on whether medical devices should be introduced into the public healthcare system. The review process is evidence-based, taking into account the safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and other relevant considerations, including international recommendations and practices, as well as professional views, so as to ensure that public resources are utilised fairly and efficiently to enable patients to receive appropriate treatment. Drugs and medical devices which meet the safety and efficacy standards required for registration under the regulatory regime for medical products in Hong Kong currently under reform do not necessarily meet the standards for inclusion in public healthcare services. In particular, when introducing innovative drugs or medical devices to the public healthcare system, consideration has to be given to the prioritisation in overall resource allocation and the cost-effectiveness of the innovative drugs and medical devices concerned, including a comparison with the existing treatment options, so as to optimise the use of limited healthcare resources.

  Evaluation of new drugs is an on-going process driven by evolving medical evidence, the latest clinical developments and market dynamics. Under the current mechanism, the HA's Drug Advisory Committee convenes regular meetings to review applications for inclusion of new drugs submitted by doctors or pharmaceutical manufacturers. Over the past five years (i.e. from 2020-21 to 2024-25), a total of 264 applications for inclusion of new drugs in the HADF were received. Of these, 116 applications were approved for inclusion in the HADF, accounting for over 40 per cent of the total number of applications. Details of the drugs involved are listed in the Appendix. The main reasons for applications not being approved for inclusion in the HADF include availability of other alternative drugs in the HADF with comparable benefits, insufficient evidence to demonstrate the long-term efficacy or significant clinical benefits of the drug, and insufficient evidence to support the cost-effectiveness of the drug treatment.

  In view of the continuous rapid advancement in medical technology and the ever-increasing public expectations, the HA has, since the implementation of the HADF, continued to refine its review mechanism on the HADF through incorporating additional stakeholders into the review process, thereby increasing the transparency of the decision-making process regarding the HADF's coverage. Specifically, in processing applications for new drugs or indications, the HA has consistently maintained close communication with various stakeholders and disseminated relevant information to the stakeholders through multiple channels. For example, prior to meetings of the Drug Advisory Committee, the agenda and list of new drugs under discussion will be sent to patient groups. Following the meetings, the deliberation outcomes (including the primary reasons for not approving particular applications for inclusion in the HADF) will be disseminated for reference. Relevant information will also be uploaded to the HADF's webpage.

  While the HA does not maintain statistics on the time required from the receipt of application to inclusion of drugs in the HADF, to speed up the introduction of suitable new drugs into the HADF, the HA has simplified the application process for inclusion of new drugs in the HADF since the end of 2024. Clinicians and pharmaceutical companies can submit new drug applications directly to the Drug Advisory Committee. The frequency of prioritisation exercise for including new drugs in the safety net will also increase from twice a year to four times a year. With the implementation of the above new mechanisms, the HA has been actively optimising the procedures for introducing new drugs into the HADF, with the objective of reducing the time required for introducing new drugs with proven efficacy into the HADF or the coverage of the safety net by half, from the original 10 months to five months; and from 18 months to nine months respectively, so as to enable patients to have access to new drugs as soon as possible, and to obtain the subsidies under the safety net to alleviate the burden of drug expenses. Furthermore, the HA will establish the Office for Introducing Innovative Drugs and Medical Devices in the first half of 2026 which will proactively engage with relevant pharmaceutical companies on the Mainland and other regions so as to facilitate the registration of innovative drugs in Hong Kong and their inclusion in the HADF.

  The HA will continue to pay close attention to the latest scientific research and clinical evidence of drugs suitable for treatment of various diseases, with a view to ensuring that patients are provided with cost-effective drugs of proven safety and efficacy as well as continuous optimal care.

(4) For drugs which cover multiple indications, the accumulation of clinical evidence for each indication is influenced by various factors. As a result, the evidence regarding the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the same drug may vary across different indications. As aforementioned, the review process of the HADF is evidence-based. Given that the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the same drug may vary across different diseases, the HA evaluates applications for inclusion of each new drug and indication into the HADF from perspectives such as evidence-based medicine practice, equitable and effective use of public resources, targeted subsidisation, and opportunity cost. This ensures that healthcare resources are focused on treatments that have been proven effective through rigorous research.

(5) The HKSAR Government has been following the principles of complementarity and mutual benefits to enhance healthcare-related co-operation with various Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), on the premise of benefitting the development of the healthcare systems of Hong Kong and the Mainland, so as to provide convenience to Hong Kong residents who choose to develop and reside on the Mainland. In particular, the Government supports the healthcare needs of these Hong Kong residents through collaboration with suitable healthcare organisations in the Mainland cities in the GBA. Examples include the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme, the Pilot Scheme for Supporting Patients of the Hospital Authority in the GBA, as well as the proposed new function under the five-year plan of eHealth+ to allow members of the public to keep and use their personal medical records from within and outside Hong Kong.

  The regime for the evaluation, approval, registration and import of pharmaceutical products are different in Hong Kong and the Mainland. In particular, importation of Hong Kong pharmaceutical products is governed under the Import and Export Ordinance (Cap. 60), and thus must be covered by a licence issued by the DH under the authority of the Director-General of Trade and Industry. However, pharmaceutical products imported in the accompanied personal baggage of a person entering Hong Kong for his or her personal use and in reasonable quantity may be exempted from the licensing requirement. However, these products which have not been registered in accordance with the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138) may not meet Hong Kong's requirement for the safety, quality and efficacy of registered pharmaceutical products.

  The HKSAR Government, with the important role of protecting the health of Hong Kong citizens, will continue to provide quality healthcare services to Hong Kong citizens with no intention to shift such responsibility to the Mainland healthcare system. In this connection, the Government has currently no plan to specifically provide support for members of the public to go north to buy drugs.

(6) Currently, the HADF contains a variety of drugs for treating various diseases, among which most classes of drugs are provided to public hospital patients at a standard fee which is heavily subsidised by the Government. In cases where doctors, based on patients' clinical needs, recommend the use of self-financed drugs which are outside the scope of the highly subsidised service, the patients concerned will be informed of the cost of the prescribed course of drug treatment by the doctors or pharmacy staff so as to facilitate patients' consideration on whether to proceed with the recommended treatment.

  Meanwhile, the vast majority of commonly used drugs in the HA are currently procured through open tendering. To maintain high transparency in procurement information, the HA has consistently published details such as drug tender notices, the names of successful tenderers, contract summaries, total drug quantities and total contract values online for public access. However, given that drug prices are commercially sensitive information, the HA will not disclose the unit price of specific purchased drugs in order to avoid affecting the drug procurement process and the bargaining power of the HA during the process."

Among the fourth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 10 survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released four batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 32 survey areas. Among these 32 survey areas, 24 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Eight other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes.

立法會十五題：帶狀疱疹,2025-10-22 16:55,2025-10-22 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200473.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上黎棟國議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉近年多個國家或地區大力鼓勵長者和患有長期病患的病人接種帶狀疱疹（俗稱「生蛇」）疫苗（「該疫苗」）。而政府於本月八日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，醫務衞生局亦已委託香港大學進行接種該疫苗的成本效益分析，而疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（「科學委員會」）預計最快要等待該分析完成後，才會於明年討論該疫苗的接種事宜。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現行各個政府資助及免費疫苗接種計劃的詳情，以及過去五年，各個計劃的受惠人數和開支分別為何；

（二）是否知悉，現時澳門及香港其他周邊地區是否設有該疫苗的資助或免費接種計劃；如知悉有相關資助，詳情為何；當局現時在保護免疫力弱人士免受傳染力高的疫病感染方面有否推出其他針對性措施；如有，該等措施的詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）當局預計科學委員會展開討論後，需時多久才能決定是否將該疫苗納入政府的防疫注射計劃；及

（四）鑑於科學委員會作出第（三）項所述的決定需時，當局有否考慮將該疫苗納入醫院管理局的免費或資助藥物名冊，並替正在接受化療的癌症和患有免疫系統疾病的病人注射，以減輕他們受感染的機會或在感染帶狀疱疹後帶來的痛苦？

答覆：

主席︰

帶狀疱疹（俗稱「生蛇」）是由引起水痘的水痘帶狀疱疹病毒引致。病毒於水痘患者痊癒後潛藏在體內的神經系統。多年後當身體免疫力下降，有機會誘發自身病毒重新激活，出現帶狀疱疹，故此並非由傳染而引發的疾病。患者皮膚出現一種令人痛楚、呈帶狀的紅疹並帶有水泡，一般並不嚴重，出現嚴重併發症或死亡風險不高，及早使用抗病毒藥物治療可加快水泡癒合、減輕症狀和出現併發症的風險。

世界衞生組織於今年七月發表的帶狀疱疹疫苗立場文件指出，重組帶狀疱疹疫苗能預防帶狀疱疹，而其常見的副作用包括接種部位疼痛和紅腫、頭痛、發燒、發冷、肌肉疼痛，以及疲倦等。就未納入政府資助免疫接種計劃的疫苗，市民可諮詢家庭醫生的專業意見，了解接種相關疫苗的效益、風險及必要性，並根據醫生對健康狀況、過往病歷等因素而作出的評估，在知情同意下決定是否安排接種。

就黎棟國議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署和醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）由衞生署推行並已恆常化的疫苗接種計劃，包括季節性流感疫苗／肺炎球菌疫苗接種計劃，為合資格人士提供免費或受資助的季節性流感疫苗和肺炎球菌疫苗接種服務。此外，衞生署的香港兒童免疫接種計劃為合資格兒童提供免費疫苗接種服務，以預防12種對公共衞生有重要影響的傳染病，包括結核病、乙型肝炎、小兒麻痺症、破傷風、百日咳、麻疹、白喉、流行性腮腺炎、德國麻疹、水痘、肺炎球菌病和人類乳頭瘤病毒感染。

過去五年上述恆常疫苗接種計劃的接種統計數字，以及季節性流感疫苗和肺炎球菌疫苗的開支載於附件。由於香港兒童免疫接種計劃的開支分散在多個成本項目，故此未能分項列出。

（二）據了解，內地和澳門特別行政區現時並無提供帶狀疱疹疫苗的資助或免費接種計劃。中國疾病預防控制中心建議，如果需要接種，市民可諮詢當地預防接種門診，自願自費接種。

政府鼓勵市民特別是免疫力弱人士提高警覺，如市民出現病徵，應盡早求醫，並按醫生指示用藥。出現症狀的患者服用抗病毒特效藥可縮短帶狀疱疹痊癒所需的時間。在病發三至五天內服食最為理想。同時，政府致力提升以地區為本的基層醫療健康服務，扭轉現時「重治療，輕預防」的醫療體制和觀念。措施包括政府透過地區康健中心推行「健康人生計劃」，針對市民不同人生階段的健康需求，根據市民的性別、年齡、家族病史等個人因素，制訂個人化的健康管理方案。政府透過家庭醫生和基層醫療專業人員提供慢性疾病和癌症篩查和健康生活模式的建議和教育，促進市民整體健康。政府亦提醒巿民，保持良好生活習慣包括均衡飲食和適量運動，有助增強抵抗力和預防帶狀疱疹。

市民是自己個人健康的第一責任人，需要從個人健康角度仔細考慮是否採取個別預防措施。至於從醫療政策角度考慮以公帑資助必須建基於公共衞生理由及利弊。

（三）醫務衞生局委託香港大學正進行有關帶狀疱疹疫苗成本效益分析，報告預計於二○二六年內完成。衞生署衞生防護中心轄下的疫苗可預防疾病科學委員會（科學委員會）將於收到報告後檢視有關研究結果，並根據科學證據、本地流行病學情況、世界衞生組織的最新建議和海外經驗等，從公共衞生角度就本港帶狀疱疹疫苗接種作出建議。

即使科學委員會日後建議特定高危組群接種帶狀疱疹疫苗，政府亦必須審慎評估多項因素，包括疾病對社會造成的整體醫療負擔、市民接受程度、疫苗供應及採購情況和其他公共衞生因素。因此，在現階段推測是否將該疫苗納入政府的防疫注射計劃及討論作出有關決定的時間表屬言之尚早。

就接種帶狀疱疹疫苗作個人保護的效益、風險及必要性，市民可諮詢家庭醫生的專業意見。政府亦致力提升以地區為本的基層醫療健康服務。家庭醫生和基層醫療專業人員會緊密合作，提供有關疫苗接種（包括帶狀疱疹疫苗）的資訊和教育，提升市民對帶狀疱疹疫苗的認識及預防意識。

（四）現時，帶狀疱疹疫苗接種並未納入醫管局為接受化療的實體腫瘤癌症患者而設的治療方案。醫管局會繼續密切留意科學委員會發出的最新建議，以及帶狀疱疹疫苗有否納入政府資助免疫接種計劃，而作出適當安排。"
LCQ15: Herpes zoster,2025-10-22 16:55,2025-10-22 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200477.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lai Tung-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  It is learnt that in recent years, many countries or regions have strongly encouraged elderly persons and patients with chronic diseases to receive the herpes zoster (commonly known as shingles) vaccine (the vaccine). In its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the 8th of this month, the Government indicated that the Health Bureau had commissioned the University of Hong Kong to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the vaccine, and that the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) was expected to discuss matters relating to the administration of the vaccine next year at the earliest, upon completion of the analysis. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the details of various existing government-subsidised and free vaccination programmes, and the respective number of beneficiaries and expenditure for various programme over the past five years;

(2) whether it knows if any subsidised or free vaccination programmes for the vaccine are currently available in Macau and other neighbouring regions of Hong Kong; if it knows such subsidies are available, of the details; whether the authorities have introduced any other targeted measures to protect immunocompromised individuals from infection by highly transmissible epidemic diseases; if so, the details of those measures; if not, the reason for that;

(3) of the authorities' estimate as to how long SCVPD will take, after commencing its discussions, to decide whether to include the vaccine in the Government Vaccination Programme; and

(4) given that it will take time for SCVPD to reach the decision mentioned in (3), whether the authorities have considered including the vaccine in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary as a free or subsidised item, and administering it by injection to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and to patients with immune system diseases, in order to reduce their risk of contracting herpes zoster or alleviate the resultant suffering after contracting herpes zoster?

Reply:

President,

  Herpes Zoster (also known as Shingles) is caused by varicella-zoster virus, which is also responsible for Chickenpox. The virus remains latent in the nervous system of patients recovered from Chickenpox and may reactivate in times of weakened immune system many years later, inducing Herpes Zoster. Therefore, Herpes Zoster is not a disease caused by acute infection. Patients would develop painful, belt-like skin rash with blisters. Herpes Zoster is not serious in general and the risk of serious complications or death is not high. Early treatment with antiviral medications can speed up the healing of blisters, reduce the symptoms and the risk of complications.

  The position paper on Herpes Zoster vaccine published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in July this year pointed out that recombinant Herpes Zoster vaccine is effective in preventing Herpes Zoster, and its common side effects include pain, redness and swelling at injection site, headache, fever, chills, muscle ache, fatigue. For vaccines not included in the Government's subsidised immunisation programmes, individuals can consult their family doctor for professional advice to understand the benefits, risks and need for vaccination. Based on a doctor's assessment of health status, medical history, and other factors, individuals can make informed decisions on whether to proceed with vaccination under informed consent.

  In response to the Hon Lai Tung-kwok's question, the reply after consultation with the Department of Health (DH) and the Hospital Authority (HA) is as follows:

(1) The regularised vaccination programmes implemented by the DH, including Seasonal Influenza (SI) Vaccination Programme/Pneumococcal Vaccination Programme, provide free or subsidised SI vaccination and pneumococcal vaccination services to eligible persons. Besides, the DH provides free vaccination services for eligible children under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme (HKCIP) for the prevention of 12 communicable diseases with public health significance, namely tuberculosis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, tetanus, pertussis, measles, diphtheria, mumps, rubella, varicella, pneumococcal disease and human papillomavirus infection.

  The vaccination statistics of the aforementioned regularised vaccination programmes, and the expenditure on the SI vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine in the past five years are provided at Annex. The expenditure on the HKCIP is dispersed across multiple cost components and hence cannot be separately identified.

(2) According to our understanding, neither the Chinese Mainland nor the Macao Special Administrative Region is offering subsidised or free Herpes Zoster vaccination programmes. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that if vaccination is needed, citizens can consult local vaccination clinics and get vaccinated voluntarily at own expense.

  The Government encourages the public, especially immunocompromised individuals to remain vigilant. Members of the public, who experience symptoms, should seek medical advice early and take medications according to doctors' instructions. Antiviral drug can shorten the recovery time of Herpes Zoster patients with symptoms and it is optimal to take it within three to five days of the onset of the disease. At the same time, the Government is committed to enhancing district-based primary healthcare services to shift the emphasis of the present healthcare system and mindset from treatment-oriented to prevention-oriented. Initiatives include promoting the Life Course Preventive Care Plan through District Health Centres to formulate personalised health management plans that address the health needs of citizens across different life stages, based on personal factors such as their gender, age and family history. Through family doctors and primary healthcare professionals, the Government provides advice and education on chronic disease and cancer screenings, as well as on healthy lifestyle habits, to promote the overall health of citizens. The Government also reminds the public that maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help strengthen immunity and prevent Herpes Zoster.

  Citizens should take primary responsibility for managing their own health and should consider whether to take a particular preventive measure from personal health angle thoroughly. From the perspective of healthcare policy, the use of public funds for subsidising such a measure must be based on public health grounds and a consideration of the pros and cons.

(3) The University of Hong Kong is conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis on the Herpes Zoster vaccine as commissioned by the Health Bureau, with the report expected to be completed by 2026. Upon receiving the report, the Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases (SCVPD) under the Centre for Health Protection of the DH will review the findings. The SCVPD will make local vaccination recommendations on Herpes Zoster vaccine from a public health angle in accordance with scientific evidences, the local epidemiological situation, the latest recommendations of the WHO and overseas experiences, etc.

  Even if the SCVPD recommends the Herpes Zoster vaccine for specific high-risk groups in future, the Government will also have to carefully consider various factors, including the overall medical burden of the disease on the community, public acceptability, vaccine availability and procurement situation, and other public health factors. Therefore, it is premature at this stage to speculate on whether the vaccine will be included in the Government's vaccination programme or to discuss the timeline of making such a decision.

  Individuals can consult their family doctors for professional advice on the benefits, risks and necessity of Herpes Zoster vaccine as personal protection. The Government is also committed to enhancing district-based primary healthcare services. Family doctors and primary healthcare professionals will closely collaborate to provide information and education on vaccinations (including the Herpes Zoster vaccine), to enhance public awareness of the Herpes Zoster vaccine and preventive consciousness.

(4) Currently, Herpes Zoster vaccination is not included in the HA's treatment protocols for solid tumour cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The HA will continue to closely monitor the latest recommendations issued by the SCVPD and whether the Herpes Zoster vaccines are incorporated into the Government's subsidised immunisation programme, in order to make appropriate arrangements."
醫務衞生局局長會見傳媒談流感（只有中文）,2025-10-22 16:55,2025-10-22 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200561.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會見傳媒的談話內容：

醫務衞生局局長：今日天氣涼了很多，早上應該只有18度左右。天氣雖然轉涼，亦到了秋天，但其實今年的夏季流感季節比較遲開始，至九月初才開始，所以我們現在仍處於夏季流感季節的延續，甚至可能會一直延續至與冬季流感季節重疊。在此真的要呼籲大家小心身體，首先天氣時冷時熱，冷的時候一定要穿着足夠的衣物，保持個人衞生，而在預防流感方面，最重要始終是接種流感疫苗。

非常不開心的是，最近連續兩日都有兒童感染流感並出現嚴重重症，需要入住深切治療部，情況甚至是危殆。由九月夏季流感季節開始，開學至今已有12名兒童在不足兩個月內因為嚴重流感需要住院，甚至是深切治療部，而其中有一名兒童死亡。這再次反映，希望更多學校能夠盡快安排兒童進行流感疫苗接種，家長亦就此盡快安排接種，因為由開學至今，已經有587間學校出現了不同程度的流感爆發。

至於今年季節性流感疫苗接種方面，較上年再有進步，由九月底季節性流感疫苗接種計劃開始至今，已經接種了超過77萬劑流感疫苗，較上年增加了大概5.2%。這是一個好消息，但同一時間我們覺得仍有進步空間，特別是那些較年幼的兒童──六個月以上兒童的接種率仍然相對偏低，我在此希望鼓勵家長盡快帶小朋友接種流感疫苗。緊記「早打不要遲，十月最合時」，希望大家盡快去接種，謝謝。"
Speech by SJ at first session of 2025 APEC Structural Reform Ministerial Meeting in Incheon (English only) (with photos),2025-10-22 16:46,2025-10-22 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200504.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at ""Session 1: How Structural Reform can contribute to Building a Sustainable Tomorrow: Connect, Innovate, Prosper"" of the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Structural Reform Ministerial Meeting in Incheon, Korea, today (October 22):

  Thank you, Chair. Good afternoon, fellow ministers.

  As you may know, Hong Kong, China, as guaranteed by our Basic Law, is a free port with no tariffs or other non-tariff trade barriers; we safeguard free flow of capital and goods; we adopt a low tax policy; we practise a bilingual common law system with a judiciary enjoying the power of independent adjudication including that of final adjudication. These features, considered as a whole, enable Hong Kong, China to offer an open, fair and transparent business and investment environment. That said, we will spare no effort to continue to consider and implement structural reforms, which are deemed necessary.

  I shall focus on the three keywords of this session, namely, connect, innovate and prosper. Our journey towards sustained prosperity in the long run calls for ""enhancing connectivity"" and ""fostering innovation"".

  Enhancing connectivity is crucial, especially amidst geopolitical challenges. Hong Kong, China stands firm in supporting a rule-based international economic order. We have assisted in the establishment of the International Organization for Mediation, which was formally opened two days ago with its headquarters located in Hong Kong, China. We are eager to build stronger ties with other economies and organisations. For example, we are working closely with key international organisations like the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) and the Hague Conference on Private International Law. This December, we will host the UNCITRAL Judicial Summit during Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 to discuss legal issues concerning digitalisation. We are also seeking to establish a regional liaison office of UNIDROIT in Hong Kong, China.

  Turning to innovation, Hong Kong, China is committed to fostering an innovative landscape that promotes the use of modern technology on the one hand while ensuring that it will not be misused or abused on the other hand. For example, we will introduce a new law next year for digitalisation of trade documents based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records; and we will study how to establish a legal regime that will support and regulate the wider application of artificial intelligence in different areas.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the pathway to a sustainable tomorrow lies in connectivity and innovation - which has also been emphasised in the Strengthened and Enhanced APEC Agenda for Structural Reform for our next phase of structural reform. Together, let us connect, innovate and prosper, with a view to transforming challenges into opportunities for APEC and beyond. Thank you."

Centred on the theme ""strengthening the teaching force with the spirit of educators, composing a glorious chapter in building a leading country in education"", members of the lecture tour from different provinces and cities on the Mainland and a teacher from Hong Kong shared their valuable experiences and insights into nurturing students, enabling teachers to reflect on the contemporary significance of the spirit of educators and contributing to the advancement of high-quality education through collaborative efforts.

Speaking at the lecture, the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said that teachers are the foundation of education and the key to its advancement, and President Xi Jinping attaches great importance to the development of the teaching profession and has put forward the unique Chinese spirit of educators. The 2024-2035 master plan on building China into a leading country in education calls for the implementation of the Strengthening the Teaching Force with the Spirit of Educators campaign. Guiding the development of the teaching profession in the new era with an educator's spirit is a vital task in building the nation into a leading country in education and also an essential path to achieving Chinese modernisation and national rejuvenation.

She said that the Education Bureau (EDB) actively aligns with the national initiative to strengthen the teaching profession, and is committed to building a high-quality teaching force. This is achieved by fostering a culture of respect for teachers and love for students, commending excellent teachers, and continuously optimising and commencing teacher training and exchange programmes. These efforts broaden professional horizons, enhance innovative teaching capabilities, and provide robust support for teachers and principals to advance their expertise. Furthermore, the EDB is committed to enhancing mechanisms for upholding professional conduct of teachers, encouraging teachers to integrate their pursuit of educational professionalism with personal integrity, and strengthening the cultivation of ethical conduct and professional ethos within the teaching profession.

The opening ceremony was jointly hosted by the Director General of the Department of Teacher Education of the Ministry of Education, Mr Yu Weiyue; the Director of Bureau IV of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Chen Wei; the Director-General of the Department of Educational, Scientific and Technological Affairs of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Dr Wang Weiming; Dr Choi; and Deputy Director of the Education and Youth Development Bureau of the Government of the Macao Special Administrative Region Ms Iun Pui Iun.

香港海關早前接獲舉報，指有一款懷疑附虛假商品說明的提子於市面上出售，其包裝上的產地說明指產品於日本出產，惟該款提子懷疑產自中國內地。

經調查後，海關發現一間位於油麻地水果批發市場的水果批發及零售商，出售該款懷疑附虛假商品說明的提子。海關人員隨後從該商戶試購該款提子，當時該商戶聲稱提子的產地為中國內地，然而包裝上卻附有日本出產的產地來源標籤。由於該商戶涉嫌違反《條例》，海關隨後採取執法行動，在該水果批發及零售商檢取九十七箱（四百八十五袋）同款提子，價值約三萬七千元。

海關提醒商戶遵守《條例》的規定，而消費者購買商品時亦應光顧信譽良好的商戶。

根據《條例》，任何人在營商或業務過程中供應已應用虛假商品說明的貨品，或管有已應用虛假商品說明的貨品作出售用途，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁五年。

Fruit wholesaler and retailer convicted of supplying and possessing grapes with falsely claimed origin,2025-10-22 15:55,2025-10-22 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200480.htm,"  A fruit wholesaler and retailer was convicted and fined $36,000 today (October 22) by the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts for supplying and possessing grapes with a falsely claimed origin, in contravention of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO). A total of 97 boxes (485 bags) of grapes involved in the case were also confiscated.

Hong Kong Customs earlier received information alleging that a brand of packed grapes with false trade descriptions was put on sale in the local market. The origin statement on the packaging indicated that the product was produced in Japan, but the grapes were suspected to be produced on the Chinese Mainland.

  After an investigation, Customs found that a wholesaler and retailer in the Fruit Wholesale Market in Yau Ma Tei was selling the subject grapes bearing false trade descriptions. When Customs officers test-purchased the subject grapes later, the trader claimed the grapes were from the Chinese Mainland, while the packaging of the grapes had a label showing that the origin was Japan. Suspecting the trader had contravened the TDO, Customs took enforcement action and seized 97 boxes (485 bags) of grapes with a total value of about $37,000 from the fruit wholesaler and retailer.

Customs reminds traders to comply with the requirements of the TDO and consumers to procure products at reputable shops.

  Under the TDO, any person who supplies goods with a false trade description in the course of trade or business, or is in possession of any goods for sale with a false trade description, commits a criminal offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the TDO to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

​立法會五題：政務主任職系人員的培訓,2025-10-22 15:33,2025-10-22 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200457.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上馬逢國議員的提問和公務員事務局局長楊何蓓茵的答覆：

問題：

有輿論認為，最近多宗政府採購上的疏漏事故，反映包括政務主任的官員只會按既定程序辦事，缺乏在商業實務上的知識及培訓。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）公務員學院（學院）自成立以來，每年為政務主任職系人員所舉辦的本地培訓課程數目，以及該等課程的內容分類、時數及參與人數分別為何；

（二）過去三年，每年學院為政務主任職系人員安排的內地及海外培訓課程、專題考察及交流活動的數目，以及該等課程或活動的時數及參與人數分別為何；及

（三）據悉政府以往曾與商界合辦調任計劃，讓政務主任了解實際商業運作，現時政務主任職系人員的內地培訓課程中，有否包括於中央政府轄下的經濟、金融及商業相關部門、國營或私營大型企業，以及地方機關等進行交流或實習，以加強他們對內地經濟和商業運作，以及地方行政管理實務的認識？

答覆：

主席：

政務職系人員是專業的管理通才，在政策的制訂、執行及檢討過程中均擔任重要角色。政府十分重視職系人員的培訓及專業發展，致力協助政務主任持續提升各方面的知識及能力，以確保政務職系團隊能在不同崗位上有效發揮領導作用。

就問題各部分，我現綜合回覆如下：

公務員的培訓由公務員學院和公務員所屬部門及職系負責，前者負責不同層級公務員的通用能力培訓，後者負責該部門或職系需要的專門知識和專業能力培訓，政務職系亦然，由公務員學院和公務員事務局政務職系部共同負責。為免累贅，我不會就個別培訓項目細分負責的分部，下述回答內，統一由公務員事務局代表。

公務員事務局按政務職系各級別人員的需要訂定培訓及發展框架，讓政務職系人員在本地、內地及海外接受有系統的培訓。在本地培訓方面，過去三年（二○二三至二○二五年）超過5 800人次參與，累計培訓日數超過3 400日。試用期內的政務主任及高級政務主任的課程除涵蓋國家事務研習、國家外交事務與國際關係、政治體制、法律和司法制度等範疇，亦有專設公共行政及財務管理等實務課題的課程，鞏固政務職系人員在公共財政管理、政府財務狀況、基本工程計劃的審批程序等方面的基礎。公務員網上學習管理平台亦有提供針對公務員實務工作包括採購程序的學習內容，供所有政府人員參考。

就本地高等院校提供的學習機會，公務員事務局亦資助有志於持續進修的政務主任修讀與工作相關的兼讀研究生課程。過去三年共36人次獲得資助修讀工商管理、政治經濟及公共政策等學科的碩士課程。

在內地培訓方面，各級政務主任的課程包括國家行政學院課程，及於內地院校（例如清華大學和北京大學）的國家事務研習課程，為期六至十二天不等。個別政策局或部門亦會各自提供國情或內地事務研習課程，供政務主任在內的高級公務員參加。過去三年，參與有關課程的政務主任超過200人次。公務員事務局亦安排具晉升潛質的高級公務員修讀北京大學舉辦的兩年制公共管理碩士課程，並提供全額資助予高級公務員參加兼讀制「清華大學高級公共管理碩士香港政務人才項目」。過去三年，共有六名政務主任獲安排修讀上述兩項課程。上述內地培訓除涵蓋國家事務的主題講學外，亦會安排學員到內地政府部門和公營機構（如北京市政協、中國國家鐵路集團等）以及當地企業進行實地考察，讓政務主任以多角度掌握國家各領域的發展現況和實務運作，增進對內地政府機關和商業運作模式的了解，從中汲取經驗以在其工作崗位上作參考並靈活應用。

此外，公務員事務局於二○二三年十二月開展了與粵港澳大灣區內地城市合辦的公務員交流計劃，亦在二○二四年十二月開展了與北京、上海、重慶、武漢、杭州五個內地城市的公務員交流計劃，讓雙方公務員暫駐對方工作單位一段時間，以加深雙方公務員對對方體制、法規、政策及實務運作情況的認識。在20名參與計劃的香港特區公務員中，有兩名政務主任獲派駐到深圳福田和前海等內地重點發展區域的政府單位，有機會近距離觀察和參與當地政府在政策落實、項目推動、招商引資及企業支援等實務環節的操作模式，從而加強面向市場的政策觸覺與實務能力，作為其日後制定並執行政策時的借鑑。在計劃下，亦已有30名內地公務員獲派到特區政府的政策局及部門暫駐交流，部分交流人員的工作夥伴為政務主任，在內地人員暫駐特區政府期間工作內外的交流亦增進了他們對內地社會發展及公務員工作的認識。

至於海外培訓，公務員事務局在疫情後已有序恢復政務主任到海外進修的培訓，自二○二四年至今已安排共50名通過試用期後的政務主任往巴黎政治學院及倫敦政治經濟學院接受八星期培訓；同時亦資助首長級政務主任到海外院校修讀短期行政發展課程（一般為期約一至數星期不等）或為期一年的碩士學位課程，課程涉獵國際政治經濟學、公共政策與金融商務管理等範疇，有效拓展政務主任對國際公共政策和政府施政實務的視野。

在培訓框架以外，我們素有借調政務主任至不同國際組織，現時有此安排的包括亞太區經濟合作組織、財務行動特別組織，以及亞洲開發銀行。此外，在中央政府的支持下，我們自二○一九年起首次參與聯合國初級專業人員方案，推送年輕公務人員，包括政務主任以中國人員身分到聯合國的辦事處出任不同職位。在政務職系人員不同的工作崗位的日常工作中，亦不乏處理公共行政事務以及接觸市場和業界的機會，使他們可以不斷鞏固實務技能和知識。

總括而言，政務職系人員透過培訓和其他專業發展安排包括內部定期職位調派以及與國際組織的借調計劃，均能增進並鞏固其在公共行政領域及不同專業範疇包括經濟、金融和商業實務上的知識及經驗。公務員事務局會不時評估政務職系人員的培訓及專業發展需要，適時為同事安排合適的培訓發展機會，以裝備政務職系人員應對在本地、國家以至國際層面上政策發展與日常實務的挑戰。"
LCQ5: Training of Administrative Officer grade staff,2025-10-22 15:33,2025-10-22 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200459.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Ma Fung-kwok and a reply by the Secretary for the Civil Service, Mrs Ingrid Yeung, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

 There have been public comments that the recent incidents of oversights in government procurement reflect that officials, including Administrative Officers (AOs), merely follow established procedures in performing their duties, and lack knowledge and training in commercial practices. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of local training programmes organised for AO grade staff by the Civil Service College (CSC) annually since its establishment, as well as the content category, and the numbers of hours and participants for each of the programmes;

(2) of the numbers of Mainland and overseas training programmes, thematic visits and exchange activities arranged for AO grade staff by the CSC in each of the past three years, as well as the numbers of hours and participants for each of the programmes or activities; and

(3) as it is learnt that the Government has previously organised a secondment scheme jointly with the business sector to enable AOs to understand actual commercial operations, whether the current Mainland training programmes for AO grade staff include exchanges or placements in departments related to economy, finance and commerce under the Central Government, large state-owned or private enterprises, local authorities, etc., with a view to enhancing their understanding of the Mainland's economic and commercial operations, as well as local administrative practices?

Reply:

President,

 The Administrative Service is a cadre of multi-skilled professional administrators who play a key role in the formulation, implementation and review of public policies. The Government attaches great importance to the training and professional development of Administrative Officers (AO), with a view to continuously enhancing their knowledge and capabilities, thereby ensuring that the Administrative Service remains well-equipped to effectively discharge its leadership responsibilities across different posts.

 My consolidated reply to various parts of the question is as follows:

 Training of civil servants is provided by the Civil Service College (CSC) and the respective departments and grades to which they belong. The CSC offers general competency training for civil servants at various levels, while individual departments and grades deliver specialised knowledge and professional skills training tailored to their specific needs. This arrangement also applies to the Administrative Service, whose training is jointly managed by the CSC and the Administrative Service Division of the Civil Service Bureau (CSB). To avoid redundancy, I will not specify the division responsible for individual training programmes and the CSB shall be referred to collectively in the following reply.

 The CSB has formulated a training and development framework tailored to the needs of AOs at different ranks, enabling them to receive structured training locally, on the Mainland and overseas. In terms of local training, more than 5 800 attendances were recorded with a cumulative total of over 3 400 training days over the past three years (2023 to 2025). Programmes for probationary AOs and Senior AOs cover a wide range of topics, including national studies, country's foreign affairs and international relations, political systems, legal and judicial systems, etc. There are also courses on practical topics such as public administration and financial management to consolidate officers' foundational knowledge in areas such as public finance, government financial position, and the approval procedures for capital works projects, etc. The Civil Service Learning Management Portal also provides learning materials on day-to-day operations of civil servants, including procurement procedures, for reference by all government officers.

 Regarding the educational opportunities offered by local higher education institutions, the CSB also offers sponsorship to AOs who wish to pursue continuous education to enroll in part-time postgraduate studies in fields relevant to their work. Over the past three years, a total of 36 sponsorships were granted for colleagues to pursue master's programmes in the discipline of business administration, political economy, and public policy, etc.

 For Mainland training, programmes for AOs at different ranks include those conducted by the National Academy of Governance, as well as national studies programmes conducted by Mainland institutions (e.g. Tsinghua University and Peking University), usually lasting from six to 12 days. In addition, individual policy bureaux or departments may organise their own training programmes on national affairs or Mainland-related topics for senior civil servants including AOs. Over the past three years, more than 200 attendances by AOs were recorded for the aforementioned programmes. The CSB has also arranged for senior civil servants with potential for advancement to pursue the two-year Master's Degree in Public Policy Programme offered by Peking University, and has provided full sponsorship for senior officers to enrol in the part-time Executive Master of Public Administration Programme for the Project of Hong Kong Public Administrative Talents, Tsinghua University. In the past three years, a total of six AOs were arranged to attend these two programmes. These Mainland training programmes cover not only thematic lectures on national affairs, but also include field visits to Mainland government authorities and public organisations (such as the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the China State Railway Group) as well as local enterprises. These visits allow AOs to develop a well-rounded grasp of the latest developments and operational practices across various sectors on the Mainland, and to enhance their knowledge of the modus operandi of government authorities and businesses on the Mainland, such that they may draw on these experiences as insights that can be flexibly applied across their respective roles.

 Moreover, the CSB commenced a civil service staff exchange programme with the Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in December 2023, and another exchange programme with five Mainland cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Wuhan and Hangzhou in December 2024. These programmes enable civil servants from both sides to attach to each other's side, thereby deepening mutual understanding of the respective structure, regulations, policies and operations. Among the 20 participating civil servants of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), two AOs were attached to government units in key development zones of the Mainland such as Futian and Qianhai in Shenzhen. The attachment provided them with the opportunity to closely observe and take part in practical aspects of local governance, including policy implementation, project coordination, investment attraction, and enterprise support. The experience strengthened their policy acumen and practical capabilities with market sensitivity, serving as a valuable reference for future policy formulation and execution. Under these programmes, 30 Mainland civil servants have also been attached to policy bureaux and departments of the HKSAR Government. Some of these exchange officers have worked alongside AOs, and the professional and informal exchanges during the attachment period have enhanced AOs' understanding of the social development and civil service operations on the Mainland.

 As for overseas training, the CSB has resumed overseas development programmes for AOs in an orderly manner after the pandemic. Since 2024, a total of 50 AOs on completion of probation have been arranged to attend eight-week training programmes at Sciences Po in Paris and the London School of Economics and Political Science. In parallel, the CSB has also sponsored directorate AOs to pursue short-term executive development courses (typically ranging from one to several weeks) or one-year master's degree programmes at overseas institutions. These programmes cover areas such as international political economy, public policy, and financial and business management, effectively broadening AOs' perspectives to international public policy and practical governance.

 Beyond the training framework, we have a longstanding practice of seconding AOs to various international organisations. Current arrangements include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Financial Action Task Force, and the Asian Development Bank. Moreover, with the support from the Central Government, Hong Kong took part in the United Nations (UN) Junior Professional Officer Programme for the first time in 2019, under which young civil servants including AOs have been sent to take up various positions at the UN offices as Chinese personnel. In the day-to-day work of the diverse roles within the Administrative Service, AOs are also frequently exposed to opportunities to handle public administration matters and engage with markets and the trade, thereby enabling them to continually consolidate their practical skills and knowledge.

 All in all, AOs may enhance and consolidate their knowledge and experience in public administration and various professional domains, including economics, finance, and commercial practices, through trainings and other professional development arrangements, such as regular internal postings and secondments to international organisations. The CSB would from time to time review the training and development needs of AOs and timely provide suitable opportunities to prepare them for the challenges in policy development and daily operations at the local, national, and international levels."
Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-10-22 15:24,2025-10-22 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200478.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on October 21 to noon today (October 22), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 233 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit.

立法會：署理發展局局長就「改革滲水問題處理機制」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-22 15:23,2025-10-22 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200470.htm,"  以下是署理發展局局長林智文今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上就陳恒鑌議員動議的「改革滲水問題處理機制」議案的開場發言：

主席：

我感謝陳恒鑌議員提出這項議案，讓我們可以就此滲水處理的議題交流意見。我首先在此點題，向各位說明屋宇署在整個過程中提供技術支援方面的角色和一些主要措施。

各司其職的好處

其實在滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處（聯辦處）的結構下，各相關部門一直通力合作、各司其職地解決問題。滲水若屬《公眾衞生及市政條例》所列的妨擾事項，食物環境衞生署（食環署）會按條例向滲水單位業主作跟進。如發現滲水影響樓宇結構安全或外露排水渠管有欠妥或破損時，屋宇署亦可根據《建築物條例》作出跟進，包括發出勸喻信及發出一些樓宇修葺令、勘測令或渠務修葺令等。如遇到一些情況是食水管滲漏，個案會轉介至水務署，讓其可以根據《水務設施條例》發出維修通知書。其實上述的分工機制有其道理，也鑑於各個相關部門有不同專長及角色，透過分工合作，可以處理滲水調查及相關執法工作。

善用新技術

剛才議員亦提及科技應用，屋宇署一直積極探索引入新檢測技術，以加快協助業主處理滲水問題，切實解決民憂。例如剛才提到的紅外線熱成像分析之外，我們近年亦引入微波斷層掃描，連同紅外線熱成像分析這些先進檢測技術，都能顯著提升找到滲水源頭的成功率。聯辦處已在全港落實，在可行情況下以科技檢測作為第三階段調查的首選調查工具，期望能更快速、準確地處理滲水問題。屋宇署亦建議引入更輕便的紅外線檢測工具在第一階段檢測使用，盡早甄別滲水源頭。屋宇署會持續留意海內外地區測試技術的發展，如有合適技術，我們會積極引入香港試用。

外判顧問公司制度

屋宇署聘請外判顧問公司協助聯辦處就滲水個案進行調查。我們一直對他們的表現進行密切監察，包括舉行定期工作會議，通過雙周報告了解他們的工作進度，一些需時較長的個案，我們會要求他們加快處理。對於表現欠佳的顧問公司，我們會加強抽查個案處理情況，及有需要時發出警告信和負評報告，要求其糾正及改善表現。在過去三年，聯辦處已對表現不佳的顧問公司發出54封警告信以及兩份負評報告，相關的顧問公司隨後均有按警告改善其服務表現。

向業主提供技術和財政支援

雖然解決物業內滲水問題是業主責任，政府亦十分重視對業主的支援。屋宇署正與業界商討，希望擬備一份有意向提供滲水檢測及維修人士連同參考服務價格資料的公開名單，作為市民物色合適人士處理滲水個案的參考，也作為政府對市民、業主的一個技術支援。

政府亦會一直透過不同計劃向業主提供資助或貸款進行樓宇維修，例如市區重建局的「有需要人士維修自住物業津貼計劃」；或者屋宇署的「樓宇安全貸款計劃」。另一方面，食環署和屋宇署亦已在滲水專題網頁、公眾街市和社交媒體等平台播放宣傳短片，加強宣傳妥善管理和維修保養樓宇的信息。

主席，我期望聆聽各位議員的意見，稍後再作回應。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"

HKMoA receives donation of 93 artworks from family of renowned Hong Kong calligrapher Jat See-yeu (with photos),2025-10-22 15:18,2025-10-22 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200259.htm,"  The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) is deeply honoured to receive a generous donation of 93 precious calligraphic and seal carving works from the family of renowned Hong Kong calligrapher Jat See-yeu. The Director of Leisure and Cultural Services, Ms Manda Chan, presented a certificate of appreciation to Mr Jat's son, Mr Jat Sew-tong, SC, on behalf of the department.

  Jat (1935 - 2009) had dedicated his life to the art of calligraphy, with a profound knowledge of Chinese calligraphy and Chinese classics. Years of devoted research in paleography, combined with inspiration from the New Ink Movement, led him to develop a fresh new concept of calligraphic creation. Jat also actively participated in the promotion and education of calligraphy. He served as a calligraphy instructor at major institutions for years. He was an arts adviser to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department since 2001. In the same year, he was awarded the Medal of Honour by the Hong Kong Special Administrative RegionGovernment for his contributions to fostering the art of calligraphy. The donation comprises a calligraphic scroll, albums of fountain pen calligraphy, folding fans of calligraphy and painting, and seals by Jat, which signify various periods of his artistic journey, showcasing a diversity of calligraphic scripts and styles that reflect his spirit of preserving tradition while boldly exploring new horizons. The donation also includes seals gifted by various contemporary calligraphers and seal carvers, marking his friendship and connections with his peers and emerging artists.

  The family of Jat had already donated over 100 works of calligraphy and paintings by him to the HKMoA in 2023. Their commitment to sharing their private treasures with the public reflects their selfless and noble spirit. In 2023 and 2024, the HKMoA organised the exhibition ""Boundless Universe: Calligraphy by Jat See-yeu"", featuring a selection of donated artworks and pieces from the museum's collection. The HKMoA also conducted the Research Project on Hong Kong Calligraphy, which studied Jat's life and art of calligraphy for the community.

 A spokesman for the TD said, ""A total of 200 Ordinary VRMs will be available at this online public auction. The list of VRMs (see Annex) has been uploaded to the E-Auction website. Applicants who have paid a $1,000 deposit to reserve the Ordinary VRM for auction should also register as an E-Auction user in advance in order to participate in the online bidding, including placing the first bid at the opening price of $1,000.

 Members of the public participating in the online bidding should take note of the following important points:

(1) Bidders should register in advance as an E-Auction user by ""iAM Smart+"" equipped with the digital signing function; or by using a valid digital certificate and an email address upon completion of identity verification. Registered ""iAM Smart"" users should provide their Hong Kong identity card number, while non-Hong Kong residents who are not ""iAM Smart"" users should provide the number of their passport or other identification documents when registering as E-Auction users.

(2) Bidders are required to provide a digital signature to confirm the submission and amount of the bid by using ""iAM Smart+"" or a valid digital certificate at the time of the first bid of each online bidding session (including setting automatic bids before the auction begins) to comply with the requirements of the Electronic Transactions Ordinance.

(3) If a bid is made in respect of a VRM within the last 10 minutes before the end of the auction, the auction end time for that particular VRM will be automatically extended by another 10 minutes, up to a maximum of 24 hours.

(4) Successful bidders must follow the instructions in the notification email issued by the TD to log in to the E-Auction within 48 hours from the issuance of the email and complete the follow-up procedures, including:

(6) Successful bidders will receive a notification email around seven working days after payment has been confirmed and can download the Memorandum of Sale from the E-Auction. The purchaser must apply for the VRM to be assigned to a motor vehicle registered in the name of the purchaser within 12 months from the date of issue of the Memorandum of Sale. If the purchaser fails to do so within the 12-month period, in accordance with the statutory provision, the allocation of the VRM will be cancelled and a new allocation will be arranged by the TD without prior notice to the purchaser.

 The TD has informed all applicants who have reserved the Ordinary VRMs for this round of auction of the E-Auction arrangements in detail by post.

Land Registry releases Trading Fund Annual Report,2025-10-22 15:00,2025-10-22 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200247.htm,"The Land Registry (LR) today (October 22) released the Land Registry Trading Fund (LRTF) Annual Report 2024/25.

The Land Registrar, Ms Joyce Tam, said, ""Due to an overall decrease in revenue from the registration of documents, reports on titles and e-Alert services, our revenue and profit (including interest income) registered a decrease of 4 per cent to $399.4 million and 42.7 per cent to $10.5 million respectively. The LRTF recorded a negative overall financial return on fixed assets of -12.3 per cent. While the revenue income of the LRTF is susceptible to property market conditions, we responded swiftly to tighten control over the operating expenses and enhance operational effectiveness through reprioritisation, internal redeployment and streamlining of work processes.""

Ms Tam said that a significant milestone has been reached in preparing the title registration system (TRS) on the new land first (""New Land First"" proposal). The Registration of Titles and Land (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2025 was passed by the Legislative Council (LegCo) in September 2025. The Government plans to submit the relevant subsidiary legislation to the LegCo in 2026, with a view to implementing the TRS for new land in the first half of 2027.

The ""New Land First"" proposal adopts a pragmatic strategy of resolving simple matters first before tackling the difficult ones, allowing for early benefits from the TRS in terms of better assurance and greater certainty of property titles and simplified conveyancing procedures. The LR anticipates that the experience gained from implementing the system for new land will help stakeholders reach a consensus on its progressive extension to existing land.

The LR has launched Tindy, an AI-driven chatbot on the Integrated Registration Information System Online Services website to provide interactive support for land search enquiries. The LR has also collaborated with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Digital Policy Office to develop application programming interface services for financial institutions, enabling timely access to land records and e-Alert notifications for mortgage documents. These initiatives demonstrate the LR's commitment to driving innovative services, enhancing the property market and supporting digital governance.

The report was tabled in the LegCo today. It can also be viewed or downloaded from the LR's website (www.landreg.gov.hk)."
立法會三題：應對的士司機人手短缺,2025-10-22 14:50,2025-10-22 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200401.htm,"​以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上易志明議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

有運輸業界人士預計，隨着年長的士司機退休，以及規管網約車法例生效後有司機轉為駕駛網約車，的士司機短缺問題將會加劇。此外，據報五支的士車隊亦因招聘司機困難，而難以實現規模化營運。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉全港有約21萬人持有有效的士駕駛執照，但只有兩成是活躍的士司機，政府有否調查持有的士駕駛執照人士不加入的士業的原因，以及有否估計市場尚欠多少名的士司機；

（二）有何具體措施協助的士車隊招聘司機，以使其在獲發牌照四個月後（即本年十一月底）可達到有3 500輛的士投入服務的目標；及

（三）會否考慮在今年十一月進一步優化的士筆試時推出措施，容許外勞司機在符合一定資歷及考試要求後，便可在港駕駛的士，並在的士車隊試行，以令車隊車輛數目盡快達標；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及有何其他措施增加的士司機供應？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直關注的士行業人手情況，並透過多項措施提升服務質素及協助業界改善營運環境，以期促進行業長遠健康發展，吸引更多新血投身的士業。

就易志明議員的提問，我的回覆如下：

（一）面對人口持續高齡化，各行各業都要應對人手方面的挑戰。就的士業而言，政府一直多管齊下，壯大司機供應，包括在二○二○年優化的士筆試，更新考核內容和調整試題數目，以便可以更集中考核關於的士服務的核心知識。措施推出後，應考人數在過去五年大增四成至二○二四年的接近14 000人。為了與時並進，讓的士筆試更能夠切合業界的實際運作需要，運輸署將由下個月，即十一月起，進一步優化筆試，大幅減少和簡化有關地方和路線的試題，並同時加入與提升的士服務質素相關的新議題，務求在維持評估水平的同時，吸引更多有志之士加入的士行業。

除了優化筆試外，政府亦已於二○二○年放寬申請的士駕駛執照的規限，由過往要求申請人必須持有有效私家車或輕型貨車正式駕駛執照最少三年，縮短為最少一年。另外，政府近年實施一系列措施提升的士服務水準及整體形象，包括推出系統化管理的的士車隊、舉辦的士服務嘉許計劃、增加的士乘客座位數目上限、引入的士司機違例記分制度，以及放寬的士禁區上落客限制等，為吸引新人入行帶來正面作用。

此外，僱員再培訓局亦有提供與的士司機相關的培訓課程，協助學員投身的士行業。合資格人士更可獲學費減免。

以上各項措施均有助吸引更多年輕新血考取的士駕駛執照。截至今年八月，40歲或以下的的士駕駛執照持有人約有18 200人，較二○一九年（約11 800人）增長超過五成。

現時活躍的士司機數目約有46 000人。的士駕駛執照持有人是否選擇成為活躍的士司機，受多個因素影響，包括個人就業選擇、整體經濟和行業營運環境、營運收入和成本（例如車租水平）等，難以一概而論。政府會繼續採取多項措施，促進的士業健康發展，吸引新血入行，壯大司機供應。

（二）的士車隊方面，政府一直因應車隊的需要積極協調及提供協助，包括推動各車隊與第三方平台合作以提供統一召車服務、便利車隊的士驗車安排、協調車隊營辦商申請「純電動的士百分百擔保貸款專項計劃」，以及向市民及遊客宣傳車隊服務等。此外，為了方便車隊的士接載已預約行程的乘客，運輸署已於機場、部分口岸、高鐵站等13個地點設置約80個車隊的士專屬停車處。

有關招聘司機方面，政府一直有安排車隊營辦商參與由勞工處舉辦的地區招聘會及專題招聘會，讓營辦商可向求職者詳細講解車隊對司機的管理、培訓與支援，吸引現職司機和新血加入。此外，各個車隊亦透過其他措施招募司機，包括在電台和社交媒體上刊登廣告、提供新人介紹費和駕駛安全獎金，以及引入彈性工作時間等。

根據我們了解，招聘會和上述措施吸引不少行外人士查詢，並成功招聘超過100人轉行加入車隊。政府會繼續助力車隊招募司機，並會繼續督促各車隊營辦商積極優化服務，加快招募司機及車主，推動各車隊邁向所承諾的規模，為乘客提供優質的士服務。

（三）至於有關輸入外勞的建議，考慮到的士屬於個人化點對點交通服務，司機需要熟悉本港道路網絡及交通系統，並因應即時交通情況，採用最直接而切實可行的路線駛往目的地，亦需要與乘客保持溝通，以及按乘客需求調整路線和下車地點。因此，的士的服務性質與定點定線的小巴或非專營巴士服務有所不同。政府目前未有計劃就的士行業輸入外勞。

正如我剛才介紹，我們會繼續密切留意的士業人力資源的最新情況，透過不同措施吸引新血入行，並與業界保持溝通，確保的士服務的穩定性以及行業的長遠健康發展。

多謝主席。"
LCQ3: Addressing manpower shortage of taxi drivers,2025-10-22 14:50,2025-10-22 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200402.htm,"âFollowing is a question by the Hon Frankie Yick and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

Some members of the transport industry anticipate that the problem of shortage of taxi drivers will aggravate as elderly taxi drivers retire and some drivers switch to driving ride-hailing vehicles following the legislation regulating ride-hailing vehicles comes into effect. Moreover, it has been reported that five taxi fleets are struggling to achieve scaled operation due to difficulties in recruiting drivers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that there are about 210 000 holders of valid taxi driving licences in Hong Kong, but only 20 per cent of them are active taxi drivers, whether the Government has investigated the reasons why holders of taxi driving licences do not join the taxi industry, and whether it has estimated the number of taxi drivers in shortfall in the market;

(2) of the specific measures in place to assist taxi fleets in recruiting drivers, so that they can achieve the target of having 3 500 taxis in service four months after obtaining their licenses (i.e. by the end of November this year); and

(3) whether it will consider introducing measures after the upcoming enhancement of the Taxi Written Test in November this year, to allow imported drivers to drive taxis in Hong Kong after meeting certain qualifications and examination requirements, and implement this on a trial basis in taxi fleets with a view to helping the trade achieve its targeted fleet size as early as possible; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and the other measures in place to increase the supply of taxi drivers?

Reply:

President,

The Government has all along been keeping in view the manpower situation of the taxi industry, and has introduced various measures to enhance the service quality of taxis and support the trade in improving the operating environment, with a view to promoting the healthy development of the industry in the long run and attracting more new blood to join the taxi industry.

Regarding the Hon Frankie Yick's questions, my reply is as follows:

(1) In light of the continuously ageing population, all trades are compelled to cope with manpower-related challenges. In terms of the taxi industry, the Government has been taking a multi-pronged approach to expand the overall driver supply, including the enhancement of Taxi Written Test in 2020 by updating the test content and adjusting the number of questions, with a view to focusing more on the assessment of core knowledge regarding taxi services. Upon implementation of the measure, the number of candidates sitting the Test has increased significantly by 40 per cent in the past five years to around 14 000 candidates in 2024. To keep up with the times and better align the Taxi Written Test with the operational needs of the trade, the Transport Department (TD) will start from the next month, which is in November, further enhance the Test by substantially reducing and simplifying the questions on locations and routes, and adding new questions related to enhancement of taxi service quality, with the aim of maintaining assessment standards while attracting more aspiring individuals to join the taxi industry.

Apart from enhancing the Taxi Written Test, the Government has also relaxed the eligibility requirements for taxi driving licences in 2020. The period required for an applicant to hold a private car or light goods vehicle full driving licence has been shortened from a minimum of three years to at least one year. Besides, the Government has implemented a number of measures in recent years to enhance the service quality and overall image of the taxi industry, thereby bringing a positive impact on attracting new blood to join the industry. Such measures include introducing taxi fleets with systematic management, organising the Taxi Service Commendation Scheme, increasing the maximum passenger seating capacity of taxis, introducing a Taxi-Driver-Offence Points system, and relaxing no-stopping restrictions for taxis at designated restricted zones.

In addition, the Employees Retraining Board also offers taxi-driver-related training courses to assist participants to join the taxi driver industry. Eligible persons may even receive tuition reductions.

All these measures help attract more young new blood to apply for taxi driving licence. As of August this year, there were approximately 18 200 taxi driving licence holders aged 40 or below, representing an increase of over 50 per cent compared to 2019 (with around 11 800 taxi driving licence holders aged 40 or below).

The current number of active taxi drivers is about 46 000. Whether a taxi driving licence holder opt to become an active taxi driver depends on multiple factors and could not be generalised. These factors include individual career preferences, the overall economic situation as well as the operating environment, income and costs (e.g. taxi rental levels) of the industry. The Government will continue to implement various measures to promote the healthy development of the taxi industry, so as to attract new blood to join the industry and expand the overall driver supply.

(2) As for the taxi fleets, the Government has been actively co-ordinating and providing support to the fleets as needed, including facilitating each fleet to co-operate with third-party platform to provide centralised taxi-hailing service, facilitating vehicle examination arrangements for fleet taxis, co-ordinating fleet operators' applications for Dedicated 100% Loan Guarantee Scheme for Battery Electric Taxis, and promoting fleet services to citizens and tourists. In addition, to facilitate fleet taxis' picking up of passengers with pre-booked service, the TD has set up about 80 designated fleet taxi stopping places across 13 locations, such as the airport, certain boundary control points and the Express Rail Link Station.

With regard to driver recruitment, the Government has been arranging for fleet operators to participate in district and thematic job fairs organised by the Labour Department, enabling fleet operators to explain to job seekers the management, training and support provided to drivers, so as to attract existing drivers and new blood to join. In addition, the fleets have also put in place different measures to recruit taxi drivers, including placing advertisements on radio and social media platforms, offering new driver referral bonus and safe driving bonus, as well as flexible working hour arrangements.

We understand that the job fairs and various measures have attracted enquiries from job seekers outside the taxi industry, and have successfully recruited more than 100 newcomers to switch careers and join the fleets. The Government will continue to support the fleets in recruiting drivers, and urge the fleet operators to proactively enhance their services and expedite the recruitment of drivers and taxi owners, with a view to driving the fleets towards their committed scale and providing passengers with quality taxi services.

(3) With regard to the suggestion on labour importation, considering that taxi is a type of personalised point-to-point transport service, drivers should be familiar with the local road network and transport system, and should be able to select the most direct and practical routes to destinations having regard to real-time traffic conditions. Drivers also need to maintain communication with passengers, and adjust routes and drop-off points in accordance with their requests. In this connection, the nature of taxi services is different from that of public light buses or non-franchised buses which have fixed stopping points and routes. At present, the Government has no plan to import labour for the taxi industry.

As mentioned earlier, we will continue to closely monitor the latest manpower situation in the taxi industry, implement various measures to attract new blood to join the industry, and maintain communication with the trade, with a view to ensuring the stability of taxi services and the healthy development of the industry in the long run.

Thank you, President."

立法會四題：積金易平台,2025-10-22 14:40,2025-10-22 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200438.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上周浩鼎議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的答覆：

問題：

據報於去年推出的積金易平台持續收到投訴，包括平台的熱線電話經常無人接聽，用戶只能留下口訊或透過電郵查詢。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉積金易平台推出至今，分別收到多少宗僱主及強制性公積金計劃成員的投訴，並按投訴類別（包括註冊困難、未能查閱登記情況及供款金額、供款未有於戶口顯示、處理供款過程繁複、難以更改或更新資料，以及客戶服務效率欠佳等）以表列出分項數字及該等投訴的平均處理時間；
（二）是否知悉目前積金易平台處理投訴的人手編制為何，以及有否計劃增加人手或採取其他措施以更有效地處理投訴；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及
（三）鑑於有意見指出積金易平台處理投訴的時間過長，至今有多少宗投訴個案未能於所訂服務標準時限（即12個工作天內）完成處理，以及其未能達標的原因分別為何？

答覆：

主席：

積金易平台（平台）旨在將強制性公積金（強積金）計劃行政工作標準化、精簡化和自動化，從而提升運作效率、減省行政成本、推動減費，並為管理強積金帳戶提供更多便利。就問題的各部分，經諮詢強制性公積金計劃管理局（積金局）後，現綜合答覆如下。

積金易平台於去年六月推出，至今已有10名受託人管理的17個強積金計劃加入平台，合共佔強積金總資產值約百分之四十三。自推出以來，積金易平台的運作大致暢順，截至今年九月底，平台已處理超過160萬宗包括供款及提取強積金等不同類型的行政指示。

在平台啓用初期，有僱主及計劃成員在使用平台時遇到困難，包括透過臉容識別技術註冊帳戶時出現問題、付款指示有欠清晰、標記供款及識別自願性供款需時較長以致未及在成員帳戶中顯示等。

政府十分關注這些情況，並已責成積金局和積金易平台有限公司（積金易公司），必須迅速處理相關查詢和投訴，積極為僱主及計劃成員提供適切和及時的支援，以確保計劃成員的強積金資產得到充分保障，以及享有良好的用戶體驗。已採取的措施包括委派專人協助相關僱主盡快掌握平台的具體操作；在常設的查詢熱線之外，額外設立供款查詢專線，方便僱主或僱員查詢供款資料；加強承辦商員工培訓及強化特殊個案的通報機制；在平台上提供更清晰的供款指引，以及在確保用戶個人資料安全的大前提下，調整臉容識別軟件以簡化註冊積金易平台的流程。

積金易公司就平台提供的服務均設有服務承諾，在處理熱線查詢及留言方面，平台職員一般會在兩分鐘內接聽熱線查詢，以及於下一個工作天內回覆熱線語音留言。至於處理投訴及書面查詢，一般情況下，平台職員會在三個工作天內確認收到投訴或書面查詢，並於12個工作天內作出回覆。有關詳情亦已載於積金易公司的官方網站，以便公眾參考。

積金易平台自去年六月啓用至今年九月底，一共接獲約2 400宗投訴個案，有關個案類別載列於附表。超過九成的個案能於服務承諾的時限內作出回覆，一般處理時間約為10至12個工作天。餘下少數未能於12個工作天內作出回覆的個案，主要是由於個案較為複雜，例如涉及投訴人在其所屬計劃加入平台前向受託人所作的行政指示，因此需要較長時間處理。政府已要求積金局和積金易公司密切監察承辦商在處理投訴方面的服務水平，確保所有投訴均獲適切處理。為此，積金易公司近日亦設立了追蹤表現系統，持續監察平台的營運數據及就重要程序加設提示，提醒承辦商職員在指定時限內完成處理僱主和計劃成員作出的指示。

在人手方面，承辦商已於過去三個月增加超過六成人手專責處理積金易相關的查詢和投訴，由六月底約500名職員增加至九月底超過800名職員，並會在今年年底前進一步增添人手至超過1 100名，即於半年間大幅增加人手超過一倍，以持續提升用戶體驗，以及為應對較大型受託人即將加入積金易平台作好準備。與此同時，積金局及積金易公司已敦促承辦商必須持續優化投訴處理機制，已落實的措施包括安排客服職員專責跟進個案，並與投訴人保持緊密聯絡、優化前線職員使用的系統介面，以及為職員提供適當培訓等，以加快處理投訴個案。政府、積金局及積金易公司會繼續密切監察積金易平台的投訴處理機制，務求為僱主及計劃成員提供更優質的客戶服務。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: eMPF Platform,2025-10-22 14:40,2025-10-22 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200439.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Holden Chow and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  It has been reported that complaints have been received continuously against the eMPF Platform since its launch last year, including cases in which calls to its hotline were frequently unanswered and users had no alternative but to leave voicemails or submit enquiries via email. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the respective numbers of complaints received from employers and Mandatory Provident Fund scheme members against the eMPF Platform since it has been launched, with a tabulated breakdown of the numbers of complaints and their average processing time by type of complaints (including difficulties in registration, failure to access enrolment status and contribution records, failure to show contribution records in user accounts, complicated procedures for handling contributions, difficulties in changing or updating information, and inefficient customer services, etc.);

(2) whether it knows the current staffing establishment of the eMPF Platform for handling complaints, and whether there are plans to increase manpower or take alternative measures to handle complaints more effectively; if there are plans, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views pointing out that it takes excessively long time for the eMPF Platform to handle complaints, of the number of complaint cases which have not been resolved within the stipulated timeframe under its service delivery standards (i.e. within 12 working days) so far and the respective reasons for failing to meet the standards?

Reply:

President,

  The eMPF Platform (the Platform) seeks to standardise, streamline, and automate Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) scheme administration work, thereby enhancing operational efficiency, reducing administrative costs, driving fee reduction, and providing greater convenience in managing MPF accounts. In consultation with the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority (MPFA), our consolidated reply to the various parts of the question is as follows.

  Since the launch of the eMPF Platform last June, 17 MPF schemes administered by 10 trustees have onboarded the Platform, altogether accounting for roughly 43 per cent of the total MPF assets-under-management. Since its launch, the eMPF Platform's operation has been largely smooth. As at end-September this year, the Platform has processed over 1.6 million administrative instructions of various types, including making MPF contributions and withdrawals.

  During the initial launch phase of the Platform, some employers and scheme members encountered difficulties in using the Platform, including issues with account registration through facial recognition technology, unclear payment instructions, and delays in tagging payments and identifying voluntary contributions resulting in contributions not being timely reflected in members' accounts, etc.

  The Government is highly concerned about these situations, and has already instructed that the MPFA and the eMPF Platform Company Limited (eMPF Company) must promptly address the relevant enquiries and complaints and proactively offer appropriate and timely support to employers and scheme members, so as to ensure the full protection of scheme members' MPF assets and their positive user experience. Measures already implemented include assigning dedicated officers to help the employers concerned to familiarise with the Platform's specific operation as soon as possible; setting up a contribution inquiry hotline in addition to the existing enquiry hotline to facilitate employers or employees in checking contribution information; strengthening the contractor's staff training and enhancing the reporting mechanism for exceptional cases; providing clearer guidelines on contributions on the Platform; and refining the facial recognition software to simplify the eMPF Platform registration process under the premise of ensuring the safety of users' personal data.

  The eMPF Company has set service pledges in respect of services provided by the Platform. In handling hotline enquiries and messages, the Platform staff will in general answer hotline enquiries within two minutes and return hotline voicemail messages within the next working day. As regards the handling of complaints and written enquiries, under general circumstances, the Platform staff will acknowledge receipt of complaints or written enquiries within three working days and issue replies within 12 working days. The relevant details have also been uploaded onto eMPF Company's official website for public reference.

  From its launch last June to end-September this year, the eMPF Platform received a total of about 2 400 complaint cases. The relevant case categories are set out at Annex. Over 90 per cent of the cases were issued with replies within the timeframe stipulated in the service pledges, taking an average processing time of about 10 to 12 working days. The remaining few cases could not be addressed within 12 working days mainly due to their complexity, such as those involving administrative instructions submitted to trustees by the complainants prior to the onboarding of their schemes, hence requiring more time to process. The Government has already requested the MPFA and eMPF Company to closely monitor the contractor's service standard in handling complaints to ensure proper handling of all complaints. To this end, the eMPF Company has recently implemented a performance tracking system to continuously monitor the Platform's operation statistics and to introduce alerts on critical processes, reminding the contractor's staff to complete the processing of instructions made by employers and scheme members within the specified timeframe.

  On manpower, the contractor has already increased its headcounts dedicated to handling eMPF-related enquiries and complaints by over 60 per cent in the past three months (from about 500 staff as at end-June to over 800 staff as at end-September), and will further increase its headcounts to over 1 100 by end of this year, representing a substantial increase in headcounts by more than a double within half a year which seeks to continuously enhance user experience and prepare for the imminent onboarding of larger-sized trustees to the eMPF Platform. Meanwhile, the MPFA and the eMPF Company have already urged that the contractor must continuously refine the complaint handling mechanism. Measures already implemented include arranging dedicated customer service staff to follow up on cases and maintain close communication with complainants, enhancing the system interface used by frontline staff, and providing appropriate staff training, etc, so as to expedite the processing of complaint cases. The Government, the MPFA and eMPF Company will continue to closely monitor the complaint handling mechanism of the eMPF Platform, with a view to providing employers and scheme members with customer services of higher quality.

  Thank you President."
立法會：環境及生態局局長就「改革滲水問題處理機制」議員議案開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-22 14:37,2025-10-22 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200446.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議就陳恒鑌議員動議的「改革滲水問題處理機制」議案的開場發言：

（代）主席：

我感謝陳恒鑌議員提出的議案，讓政府有機會與大家在立法會討論樓宇滲水處理機制。我會就行政長官《施政報告》內有關善用調解去處理滲水糾紛，和優化處理樓宇滲水的先導計劃作出介紹。接著署理發展局局長會講解有關樓宇維修和滲水的問題。

樓宇滲水主要原因是樓宇結構或設備損壞，而業主有責任妥善維修保養物業，包括解決滲水問題。由食物環境衞生署（食環署）和屋宇署聯合成立的滲水投訴調查聯合辦事處，下稱聯辦處，旨在處理樓宇滲水投訴個案，提供一站式服務。在現時聯辦處的架構下，屋宇署人員負責運用其在樓宇維修方面的專業知識找出滲水源頭，並可根據《建築物條例》和《水務設施條例》處理相關的滲水情況。食環署人員則按《公眾衞生及市政條例》處理公共衞生妨擾事故，兩署人員合作處理滲水個案。

推動協商和調解

政府近年大力推動涉事業主之間以協商和調解方式解決滲水糾紛。我留意到在過去三年，經由物管公司通過調解、協商或為屋苑公用地方進行改善工程等方法而得以成功解決的滲水個案佔約七成之多，效果顯著。所以食環署推出了物業管理公司協助處理住宅樓宇滲水計劃，現時已有超過200間屋苑的物管公司參加計劃。在計劃下，物管公司會協調及建議住戶透過調解或民事方式處理滲水問題。

此外，環境及生態局和食環署聯同律政司已於今年七月推出社區調解先導計劃，為物管人員提供全日制調解技巧培訓，協助他們更有效處理滲水個案。

優化滲水檢測程序先導計劃

另外，為促使業主盡快履行其妥善維修物業的責任，行政長官在今年《施政報告》宣布，聯辦處將於二○二六年上半年推出先導計劃，優化處理樓宇滲水問題的檢測程序。在先導計劃下，聯辦處會採用紅外線測試以加快甄別滲水源頭。若結果顯示滲水高於指明濕度值，會向上層單位業主發出「建議維修通知」，要求涉事業主在指定時間內自行檢查和維修。就較簡單直接的個案，我們預計向引致滲水的單位業主發出通知所需時間可大幅減至約14個工作天。

如業主逾期未有行動而滲水持續，聯辦處會展開科技檢測，甄別滲水源頭，並向業主收回檢查費用。聯辦處會評估新檢測程序的成效，以及持續檢視可應用在滲水調查的工具。聯辦處更會把以往的第二和第三階段調查改為同步進行，從而精簡程序，提升效率。

我們預計藉着推動協商／調解和先導計劃下收回檢查費用的安排，應可有效減少需要由聯辦處進行檢控調查的個案數目。我們和發展局會持續檢視檢測程序，加快處理樓宇滲水問題。

修訂法例以加強調查和阻嚇力

另一方面，為便利食環署處理樓宇滲水導致公共衞生妨擾個案，我們修訂了《公眾衞生及市政條例》（第132章），訂明單位業戶如無合理辯解而不遵從「擬進入處所通知書」，即屬罪行。《修訂條例》亦延長了政府人員可登門調查的時段至下午十時，以更好地配合市民的生活，便利進行調查。這些修訂已在今年八月生效。

（代）主席，我會細心聆聽議員就議案的發言，並會在稍後總結發言時再作回應。我現交由署理發展局局長發言。謝謝（代）主席。"
立法會二十題：降低企業的合規成本,2025-10-22 14:15,2025-10-22 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200318.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上周文港議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，香港企業（特別是中小企）的經營成本高企，其中部分行業須負擔較為沉重的合規成本。就降低企業的合規成本，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據報近年食物環境衞生署簡化食物業牌照發牌制度，其中擴大「專業核證制度」的適用範圍至普通食肆牌照申請已實施超過一年，當局有否統計，去年二月至今，選擇以該制度進行的申請宗數和其佔同期所有食肆牌照申請宗數的百分比，以及申請不獲批准的宗數和其原因分別為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為，繁複的發展審批程序會導致建築成本增加，亦會間接加重租金等營運成本，影響各行各業的發展，就此發展局已實施逾百項精簡發展程序措施，並會於今年內陸續落實其他新措施，當局有否（i）評估已實施措施的成效（尤其是在壓縮發展期及成本方面）、（ii）就該等措施制訂績效指標、（iii）設立恆常機制與業界溝通，以及（iv）為擬落實的其他新措施（包括今年《施政報告》宣布就北部都會區發展所引入的快速審批制度）制訂具體時間表；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）有否計劃加強調研各行各業（包括但不限於零售、飲食及運輸業）及不同規模的企業所面對的合規成本問題，以探討如何精簡政府各部門的規管制度（例如發牌機制，以及就處所或土地的使用限制），從而拆牆鬆綁，優化營商環境，並進一步促進本地經濟及提升企業競爭力；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就周文港議員的提問，經諮詢各有關決策局後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）為加快審批和讓業界更易掌握發牌時間，食物環境衞生署（食環署）自二○二三年三月起，以小食食肆和食物製造廠牌照為試點，引入「專業核證制度」，為申請正式牌照提供「先發牌、後審查」的額外選項，並由二○二四年二月起把制度推展至普通食肆牌照。相比原有制度，申請人可提前約14日取得正式牌照。

由二○二四年二月至二○二五年九月，有八宗食物業牌照申請選用「專業核證制度」，至今五宗已獲批，一宗仍在處理，另有兩宗及後轉用原有制度並已發牌；同期食物業牌照申請宗數為4 742宗。

（二）發展局一直致力精簡發展管制程序，為發展業界提速、提效，並降低成本。發展局於二○一八年成立「精簡發展管制督導小組」，統籌各決策局及部門（局／部門）檢視發展管制程序，並制定各項精簡措施。及後，為促進局／部門間精簡程序的機構文化，發展局於二○二四年七月發出通告，臚列指導原則及良好作業方式，並明文要求審批部門以「促進者」思維處理發展申請。

為落實通告要求，除了約100項經已實施的精簡措施，局／部門在二○二四年第三季起至二○二五年年底，陸續研究或實施約80項新措施，從而精簡發展管制程序。這些措施涵蓋範疇正正包括為審批程序的不同環節訂立指標（例如訂立審批時間承諾等），亦包括推動自行認證、引進更多分階段提交資料的安排等。這約80項新措施中，約60項已經實施，其餘的措施亦預計於二○二五年年底前推出。

另外，為加快北部都會區（北都）建設，行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》中亦宣布推出一系列措施，當中不少涉及精簡發展管制程序，例如我們將訂立「加快發展北都」專屬法例，授權政府簡化法定程序，二○二六年初會就立法建議進行兩個月諮詢，二○二六年年中左右向立法會提交條例草案以期二○二六年年底前通過。二○二五年《施政報告》亦提到，發展局會為大型發展工程設立制度，簡化工程審批，訂立清晰服務時間承諾，並加強統籌相關部門的審批流程，加快審批。具體而言，政府工程項目會由發展局項目策略及管控處負責；北都的私人發展項目由特設專案監督辦公室處理；北都以外則由發展局項目促進辦事處負責。我們的目標是在二○二五年年底前推出操作細節。

由於精簡措施各有不同性質，而每個發展項目亦有其獨特性並涉及不同程度的審批，我們難以籠統在此羅列所有措施對降低成本和加快發展的正面影響。然而，精簡發展程序時我們會着重果效，如適合的話會量化效益並公開指標。舉例來說，發展局將於二○二五年十一月初推出新措施，私人發展項目在地面興建不多於兩層停車場，可全數豁免總樓面面積。我們估計相比在地庫興建停車場，以興建兩層地面停車場為例，施工時間可望縮短超過一年，建築成本亦會減低約四成。

發展局將會繼續透過不同渠道，例如發展局土地及建設諮詢委員會轄下的精簡發展管制聯合小組委員會，以及直接與團體會面，積極諮詢業界，研究和推展不同精簡發展管制程序的措施。

（三）政府致力持續優化營商環境。其中一項措施是透過方便營商諮詢委員會，為政府提供平台，就規管建議諮詢商界，並向業界推廣方便營商措施。「營商諮詢電子平台」亦協助政府部門收集業界對規管制度的意見。此外，各局／部門亦會持續應用創新科技，及善用中央資訊科技平台和服務，例如「智方便」和構建中的「數碼企業身份」平台，提供一站式便利的電子政府服務及精簡流程，以及推出相關政策及措施，讓發牌制度更有效率、透明及方便營商，以降低業界的遵規成本，維持本港的競爭力。

同時，食環署一直積極簡化食肆發牌制度。二○二五年《施政報告》已公布食環署會採用新方式統籌相關部門進行「會審」和精簡程序，以加快審批食肆露天座位申請。"

Question:

  There are views that the operating costs of Hong Kong enterprises (particularly small and medium enterprises) are high, and some of these industries have to bear relatively heavy compliance costs. In terms of lowering the compliance cost of enterprises, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it has been reported that the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has streamlined the food business licensing regime in recent years, including expanding the scope of the ""Professional Certification System"" to cover applications for general restaurant licences, which has been in effect for over a year, whether the authorities have compiled statistics on, since February last year, the number of applications made under the licensing regime, and the percentage of the number of applications in the total number of applications for restaurant licences during the same period, as well as the number of applications which were not approved and the respective reasons;

(2) given that there are views that the complicated vetting and approval procedures for development projects will lead to an increase in construction costs, which will indirectly increase operating costs such as rentals, thus affecting the development of various trades and industries, and in this connection, the Development Bureau has already implemented more than a hundred measures to streamline the development procedures and will implement other new measures one after another this year, whether the authorities have:(i) assessed the effectiveness of the measures implemented, particularly in terms of compressing the development period and costs;(ii) formulated key performance indicators; (iii) set up a regular communication mechanism with the industry in respect of such measure; and (iv) formulated a specific timetable for the other proposed new measures to be implemented (including the introduction of the Fast Track Processing System for the development of the Northern Metropolis as announced in this year's Policy Address); if so, of the details; if not, the details for that; and

(3) whether it has plans to enhance its efforts in conducting studies on the compliance cost problems faced by enterprises of various trades and industries (including but not limited to, the retail, catering, and transport industries) and of different sizes, so as to explore ways to streamline the licensing and other regulatory regimes (e.g. the licensing regime and restrictions on the use of premises or land) of various government departments, thereby removing barriers and restrictions, optimising the business environment, as well as further promoting the local economy and upgrading the competitiveness of enterprises; if it has, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply

President,

In consultation with the relevant policy bureaux, the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Prof Hon Chow Man-kong is as follows:

(1) To expedite vetting and enable the trade to have a better grasp of the processing time, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) introduced the ""Professional Certification System"" (PCS) in March 2023 as a pilot scheme for light refreshment restaurants and food factories. The system offers an additional option of ""licence first, inspection later"" for full licence applications. Starting from February 2024, its coverage was extended to general restaurants. Compared with the prevailing system, applicants may obtain their full licences about 14 days earlier.

From February 2024 to September 2025, eight food business licence applications opted for the PCS. Of these, five were approved and one is under review. The remaining two later reverted to the prevailing system and were approved. During the same period, there were 4 742 food business licence applications.

(2) The Development Bureau (DEVB) has all along been striving to streamline development control procedures, so as to enhance speed and efficiency as well as reduce costs for the development trade. In 2018, the DEVB established the Steering Group on Streamlining Development Control to co-ordinate various bureaux/departments (B/Ds) in reviewing development control procedures and formulating various streamlining measures. Subsequently, to foster an institutional culture of streamlining among B/Ds, the DEVB issued a circular in July 2024, setting out guiding principles and best practices and explicitly requiring approving departments to adopt a ""facilitator"" mindset when handling development applications.

  To implement the requirements of the circular, in addition to the around 100 streamlining measures already implemented, B/Ds have been studying or implementing around 80 new measures from Q3 2024 till end-2025 to streamline development control procedures. These measures cover the very aspect of setting performance indicators (e.g. time pledges) for different stages of the approval process, as well as other aspects such as promoting self-certification, introducing more phased submission arrangements, etc. Of these around 80 new measures, around 60 have already been implemented, with the remaining measures expected to be rolled out by end-2025.

  Furthermore, to accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis (NM), the Chief Executive announced a series of measures in the 2025 Policy Address, many of which involve streamlining development control procedures. For example, we will introduce dedicated legislation to accelerate the development of NM, empowering the government to simplify statutory procedures. We will conduct a two-month consultation exercise on the legislative proposal in early 2026 and introduce a bill to the Legislative Council around mid-2026 in a bid to have the bill passed by end-2026. The 2025 Policy Address also mentioned that the DEVB will set up mechanisms for large-scale works projects, with a view to simplifying works approval procedures, setting clear performance pledges, and enhancing co-ordination among relevant departments on vetting processes, so as to expedite approval. Specifically, the Project Strategy and Governance Office of the DEVB will be responsible for government works projects; the dedicated project supervision office will be responsible for private development projects in the NM, while the Development Projects Facilitation Office of the DEVB will be responsible for those outside the NM. Our aim is to promulgate the relevant operational details by end-2025.

  Given the varying nature of streamlining measures and that each development project has its own individuality and requires approval process of different degree, it is difficult to crudely list out the positive impact on cost reduction and expediting development cycle posed by each and every measure. Having said that, we will take an effectiveness-oriented approach when streamlining development control; and will quantify the effectiveness and publish the relevant indicators as appropriate. For example, the DEVB will introduce a new measure in early November 2025 where private development projects constructing not more than two levels of aboveground carparks may enjoy full gross floor area exemption. It is estimated that, as compared to constructing underground carparks, constructing say two levels of aboveground carparks could reduce construction time by more than one year and construction cost by around 40 per cent.

  The DEVB will continue to proactively consult the trade through various channels, such as the Joint Subcommittee on Streamlining Development Control under the DEVB's Land and Development Advisory Committee and directly meeting with relevant bodies so as to study and implement different measures to streamline development control procedures.

(3) The Government is committed to enhancing the business environment continuously. One of the measures is through the Business Facilitation Advisory Committee that provides a platform for the Government to consult the business sector on regulatory proposals and promote business friendly measures to the industry. The ""Business Consultation e-Platform"" also facilitates government departments in gathering industry feedback on regulatory framework. In addition, various B/Ds will continue to leverage innovative technologies and central information and communications technology platforms and services, such as ""iAM Smart"" and ""Digital Corporate Identity"" (CorpID) platform being developed, to deliver one-stop convenient e-Government services with streamlined procedures, and hence relevant policies and measures on a more efficient, transparent and convenient licensing regime for the trade, with a view to reducing the business compliance costs and sustaining Hong Kong's competitiveness.

  In parallel, the FEHD has been proactively streamlining the food business licensing regime. As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, FEHD will adopt a new way to expedite the vetting of applications for outside seating accommodation of restaurants by co-ordinating relevant departments to undergo ""joint-vetting"" and streamlining procedures."

LCQ11: Improving building management of old buildings,2025-10-22 13:15,2025-10-22 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200312.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hok-fung and a written reply by the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

The Urban Renewal Authority (URA) and the Hong Kong Institute of Housing jointly implemented a pilot scheme on ""Joint Property Management"" (JPM) in 2022 for old single-block buildings in the ""Lung Shing"" area of Kowloon City. Assistance were provided to old buildings without owners' corporations (OCs) in establishing OCs, and different old single-block buildings were then coordinated to co-appoint a property management company for owners to enjoy professional management services at more affordable costs. However, in its experience report on Kowloon City's JPM Pilot Scheme submitted to the Government in March this year, URA mentioned that among the four buildings in the ""Lung Shing"" area participating in the JPM Pilot Scheme, half of them withdrew from the scheme. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that many owners of old buildings are elderly retirees who are not keen to participate in building management, leading to the near standstill of OCs of such buildings, of the Government's measures in place to encourage owners of old buildings to improve building management and carry out repairs, such as whether it will allow them to participate in the JPM Pilot Scheme or other subsidised building management schemes without the need to establish an OC;

(2) given that the Government launched the JPM Pilot Scheme in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City and Tsuen Wan in June this year for a period of one year, and it is learnt that there are over 5 000 private buildings aged 30 years or above in Hong Kong Island West, whether the Government will extend the Pilot Scheme to old private buildings in Hong Kong Island West; if so, of the implementation timetable;

(3) given that some members of the local community have indicated that last month, a public fresh water mains burst incident occurred in an old composite and domestic building on Hollywood Road, but contractors engaged by some residential unit owners were unable to gain access to the ground-floor units to repair the water mains, leaving all residential units of the building without fresh water supply, whether the Government has compiled statistics on the number of cases in the past five years where building maintenance works could not be carried out in a timely manner due to human factors (such as delays or lack of cooperation from the owners concerned); if so, of the number and details of the cases;

(4) given that the Government amended the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance (Cap. 572) last year to empower the Hong Kong Fire Services Department and the Buildings Department (BD) to carry out fire safety improvement works in default of owners failing to comply with the requirements of Cap. 572, and to recover the costs from them upon completion of the works, and that under the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123), BD will also engage government contractors to carry out emergency works in default of owners, whether the Government will, drawing on the practices under Cap. ‍572 and Cap. 123, enact legislation to empower the Water Supplies Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department or other government departments to handle building maintenance cases such as water mains or sewer leakage in default of owners, and subsequently recover the costs from the owners; if so, of the timetable for the relevant work?

Reply:

President,

The management and proper maintenance of buildings are the responsibilities of owners. The Government's role in building management is to act as a facilitator by providing a legal framework under the Building Management Ordinance (Cap. 344) to enable owners to form Owners' Corporations (OCs), and by offering a series of support services to assist owners in discharging their responsibilities jointly relating to building management.

Having consulted the Development Bureau, our consolidated reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Chan Hok-fung is as follows:

(1)and(2) To strengthen support for OCs and promote effective building management, the Home Affairs Department (HAD) has implemented the Owners' Corporations Advisory Services Scheme since 2018, under which property management companies (PMCs) are engaged to provide OCs in need with free advisory services on building management. These services include assisting in re-activating defunct or inactive management committees (MCs). For ""three-nil"" buildings which do not have any OC and have not engaged any PMC, the HAD has implemented the Building Management Professional Advisory Service Scheme (BMPASS) since 2022 to engage district organisations with experience in building management or related fields to reach out to the owners to encourage and help them form OCs. In addition, the Resident Liaison Ambassador Scheme is implemented to assist government departments in liaising with the residents to discuss and handle building management matters and promote the formation of OCs.

In assisting OCs and owners on handling building maintenance matters, the HAD organises regular briefings via the Central Platform on Building Management. Relevant government departments and institutions, including the Buildings Department (BD), the Fire Services Department, the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, the Hong Kong Police Force, the Labour Department, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) and the Competition Commission, are invited to introduce various services and financial assistance schemes on building management and maintenance. These briefings are held on-site and broadcast via live steaming, with videos subsequently uploaded to the dedicated website of the HAD for easy access by OCs and owners.

Also, the HAD and the 18 District Offices regularly organise various educational and publicity activities on building management, including seminars, training courses, talks, and exhibitions, to enhance OCs' and owners' knowledge of building management and maintenance. The HAD also invites members of the District Councils (DCs) to attend and participate in these activities, with a view to disseminating information to the community and residents through DC members and their district networks.

Some old single-block buildings may encounter difficulties in engaging professional PMCs on their own to assist with day-to-day building management due to the small number of units in the buildings and the lack of adequate financial resources. In June 2025, the HAD launched a one-year Pilot Scheme on ""Joint Property Management""(Pilot Scheme) in Yau Tsim Mong, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon City and Tsuen Wan to engage district organisations with local networks and experience in building management to assist the old buildings in these districts in jointly hiring a single PMC to manage their buildings, so that the management fees can be apportioned and these buildings will be able to receive day-to-day building management services at a more affordable cost, thereby improving their living environment. For buildings wishing to participate in the Pilot Scheme but have not formed OCs, the district organisations concerned may refer them to the BMPASS to assist them in forming OCs. However, should individual buildings be unable to form OCs due to specific circumstances, but all owners agree to participate in the Pilot Scheme, the district organisations concerned will provide support to assist these buildings in implementing ""joint property management"".

Within four months since its launch (as at September 30, 2025), the Pilot Scheme has made good progress. The district organisations engaged have reached out to nearly 130 buildings. OCs and owners have responded positively, with 70 buildings signing letters of intent to participate in the Pilot Scheme. Among these, three buildings were originally classified as ""three-nil"" buildings but formed OCs for participation in the Pilot Scheme. Currently, 16 buildings have agreed to a joint tender process so as to engage a PMC. They are jointly formulating a joint tender document, with a view to implementing the joint property management initiative as soon as possible.

The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the Government would consider extending the Pilot Scheme to other districts, subject to its implementation outcomes.

The Government has since 2018 introduced a number of subsidy schemes in partnership with the URA with a total financial commitment of $19 billion to provide financial and technical assistance to owners in need. Among the schemes, those relevant to building inspection and repair works include ""Operation Building Bright 2.0"" and ""Building Maintenance Grant Scheme for Needy Owners"", etc.

Formation of OC is not a prerequisite for joining these subsidy schemes. In fact, these subsidy schemes also accept applications from ""three-nil"" buildings, provided that the unanimous consent of all owners is obtained.

(3) In general, when repair works to leaking communal service inside ground floor shop of a building is required, the concerned owners of the building should discuss amongst themselves on various arrangements for the repair works, such as the repair method, timing in carrying out the repairs and the financial arrangement etc., in order to mitigate the impact to various parties. During the course, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) will provide technical support and when necessary, collaborate with the District Office and DC members of the area to provide appropriate assistance such as provision of temporary water supply to the affected users etc. Once consensus is reached by the concerned parties, the contractor appointed by the concerned owners would enter into the ground floor shop to carry out repair works to the communal service.

According to the WSD's record, there were two cases in the past five years where individual owners refused to grant admission to the contractor to enter into their premises for carrying out repair works to the communal service that had developed leaks or bursts, resulting in delay of works and suspension of water supply to the building. Details of the cases are as follows:




Date
Building
Case Details


June 2024
A composite Building at Shek Tong Tsui
In June 2024, main burst of the communal service at ground floor backyard caused serious flooding to shops of the building. For the sake of public safety, the WSD suspended water supply and provided temporary water supply to the shops and residential units of the building. Subsequently, the WSD provided technical support to the owner of the subject shop at ground floor and other owners of the residential units to facilitate their discussion to resolve the problem. The water main repair works completed in June 2024.


September 2025
A composite building at Hollywood Road, Sheung Wan
Serious leakage of the communal service inside a ground floor shop of the building has affected the nearby public staircase. For the sake of public safety, the WSD suspended water supply and provided temporary water supply to the users of the shops and residential units of the building immediately. The District Office and DC members of Central and Western District have provided their utmost effort in mediation. However, considering the time required for the property owners to reach consensus on hiring a contractor, and to restore water supply for the residents as soon as possible, the WSD has commenced repair works to the subject leaking communal service, on behalf of the responsible parties, pursuant to Section 17(3) of the Waterworks Ordinance (WWO). It is anticipated that the repair works would be completed within October.




(4) Under the Buildings Ordinance (BO), the BD will first issue statutory orders requiring owners to remove unauthorised building works or repair dilapidated private buildings/drainage. If owners lack the coordination capability, leading to prolonged non-compliance with orders, the BD will consider carrying out default works and recover the costs of such works, supervision charge and surcharge from the owners. On the other hand, if an obvious danger or emergency is identified and the owner is unable to organise emergency repairs, the BD will proactively intervene regardless of whether a statutory order is involved. The BD will arrange for government contractors to undertake emergency works to remove the danger first, and recover the costs of the works and supervision charge from the owners concerned afterwards in accordance with the BO.

As for the WSD, if a consumer or agent, on receipt of a repair notice, fails to carry out the repairs specified in the notice, the WSD may carry out the repairs and the cost thereof shall be payable by the consumer or agent pursuant to Section 17(4) of the WWO. Moreover, pursuant to Section 17(3) of WWO, the WSD may repair an inside service at the request of a consumer, or a communal service at the request of an agent, and the cost thereof shall be payable by the person at whose request such repair is carried out. The WSD shall critically review the situation of each case before stepping in to carry out the repair works on behalf of the consumer or agent under relevant provisions of the WWO. The major considerations include whether the responsible parties have difficulty in coordinating themselves to appoint a contractor in a short period of time (e.g. cases of ""three-nil"" buildings), whether the water supply involve essential facilities (e.g. hospitals and airport), and whether the repair works involve other more complicated work (e.g. road works)."
立法會十一題：改善舊式樓宇的大廈管理,2025-10-22 13:15,2025-10-22 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200294.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上陳學鋒議員的提問和民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟的書面答覆：

問題：

市區重建局（市建局）與香港房屋經理學會組成的團隊在二○二二年於九龍城「龍城區」的單幢式舊樓試行「聯廈聯管」，在協助未有成立業主立案法團（法團）的舊樓成立法團後，再協調不同單幢式舊樓聘用同一物業管理公司，讓業主能以較相宜的費用獲取專業管理服務。然而，市建局於今年三月向政府提交的《九龍城區「聯廈聯管」試行經驗分享報告》中提及，「龍城區」四幢參與聯廈聯管計劃的大廈中，有一半退出計劃。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉不少舊樓業主均為年長退休人士，不太熱衷參與大廈管理事務，以致該等樓宇的法團運作幾近停擺，政府有何措施鼓勵舊樓業主改善大廈的管理和進行維修，例如會否讓其在無須成立法團的情況下參與「聯廈聯管」或其他資助大廈管理計劃；

（二）鑑於政府已在今年六月在油尖旺、深水埗、九龍城和荃灣推行為期一年的「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃，而據悉位於港島西的30年樓齡或以上的私人樓宇有超過5 000幢，政府會否將該試驗計劃擴展至港島西的舊式私人樓宇；若會，實施時間表為何；

（三）鑑於有地區人士表示，上月荷李活道一幢舊式綜合用途及住用建築物發生公用食水管爆裂事故，惟由部分住宅單位業主委聘的承辦商未能成功進入地鋪單位維修水管，以致整幢大廈的住宅單位沒有食水供應，政府有否統計，過去五年有多少宗因人為情況（例如相關業主拖延或不合作）而導致大廈維修工程未能及時進行的個案；若有，個案的數目及詳情為何；及

（四）鑑於政府於去年修訂《消防安全（建築物）條例》（第572章），賦權香港消防處和屋宇署代未能遵從第572章的要求的業主進行消防安全改善工程，並在工程完成後向其收回費用，而根據《建築物條例》（第123章）屋宇署亦會委聘政府承建商代業主進行緊急工程，政府會否參考第572章及第123章的做法，立法賦權水務署、機電工程署或其他政府部門，代業主處理水管或污水渠滲漏等樓宇維修個案，再向業主收取費用；若會，有關工作的時間表為何？

答覆：

主席：

大廈的管理和妥善維修是業主的責任。政府在大廈管理的角色是擔當推動者，透過《建築物管理條例》（第344章）提供法律框架，讓業主成立業主立案法團（法團），並提供一系列支援服務，協助業主共同履行管理大廈的責任。

就陳議員提問的各部分，經諮詢發展局後，現綜合回覆如下︰

（一）及（二）為加強對法團的支援，促進有效的大廈管理，民政事務總署（民政總署）自二○一八年推出「法團諮詢服務計劃」，委聘物業管理（物管）公司為有需要的法團提供免費的大廈管理諮詢服務，包括協助已停止運作或不活躍的法團管理委員會（管委會）恢復運作。對於未有成立業主組織或聘用物管公司管理的「三無大廈」，民政總署自二○二二年透過「大廈管理專業顧問服務計劃」（「專業顧問服務計劃」），委託具有大廈管理或相關經驗的地區組織接觸業主，鼓勵及協助他們成立法團；同時亦透過「居民聯絡大使」計劃，協助政府部門聯絡大廈居民，商討和處理樓宇管理工作，並推動有關大廈成立法團。

就協助法團和業主處理大廈維修等事宜方面，民政總署透過「大廈管理中央平台」，定期舉辦簡介會，邀請相關政府部門及機構，包括屋宇署、消防處、機電工程署、警務處、勞工處、廉政公署、市區重建局和競爭事務委員會，介紹各類與大廈管理及維修相關的服務和財政支援計劃。簡介會除了實體舉行，亦進行網上直播，有關視頻亦會上載到民政總署的專題網站，方便法團及業主閱覽。

民政總署和18區民政事務處（民政處）亦定期舉辦各類大廈管理的教育和宣傳活動，包括研討會、培訓課程、講座和展覽等，提升法團和業主對大廈管理及維修的知識。同時，民政總署亦會邀請區議員出席及參與，透過區議員和其地區網絡，向社區及居民傳遞相關信息。

部分舊式單幢大廈因單位數量不多，財政資源不足，難以獨自聘用專業物管公司協助處理日常的大廈管理工作。民政總署已於二○二五年六月在油尖旺、深水埗、九龍城及荃灣四區啓動「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃，為期一年，透過委聘具備地區網絡及大廈管理經驗的地區組織，協助區內的舊式樓宇，共同聘請一間物管公司聯合管理大廈，攤分管理成本，以較相宜的費用獲得日常的大廈管理服務，從而改善居住環境。如希望參與試驗計劃的大廈未成立法團，地區組織會先轉介予「專業顧問服務計劃」以協助該大廈成立法團。然而，如因個別情況而未能成立法團，但有關大廈的業主均同意參與試驗計劃，獲委聘的地區組織亦會提供支援，協助有關大廈推行「聯廈聯管」。

計劃推出四個月（截至二○二五年九月三十日）已取得良好的進展。獲委聘的地區組織已合共接觸近130幢大廈，法團和業主反應正面，已經有70幢大廈簽署意向書參與試驗計劃，其中三幢原本屬「三無大廈」，但為了參與試驗計劃而成立法團。目前，16幢大廈已同意聯合招標，並制訂「聯合招標書」，以招標聘請物管公司，期望儘早落實「聯廈聯管」。

行政長官於二○二五年《施政報告》宣布，視乎「聯廈聯管」試驗計劃的推展情況，考慮將試驗計劃推廣至其他地區。

政府自二○一八年先後共投入約190億元，夥拍市區重建局（市建局）推出多項樓宇復修資助計劃，為有需要業主提供財政及技術支援。當中資助業主進行樓宇檢驗及維修工程的主要資助計劃包括「樓宇更新大行動2.0」及「有需要人士維修自住物業津貼計劃」等。

成立法團並非參與這些資助計劃的先決條件。事實上，只要獲得全體業主一致同意，這些資助計劃亦接受「三無大廈」的申請。

（三）一般而言，若位於大廈地鋪範圍內的公用水管出現滲漏而需要維修，大廈相關業主需要商討維修工程上的各項安排，例如維修方法、施工時間、財務安排等，以減低對各方所帶來的影響。其間，水務署會提供技術支援，並在有需要時會聯同當區民政處及區議員提供適切的協助，例如為受影響的用戶提供臨時食水供應。當各方達成共識後，相關業主聘請的承辦商便會進入地鋪範圍進行公用水管維修工程。

根據水務署記錄，過去五年有兩宗涉及因為個別業主拒絕承辦商進入其單位為出現滲漏或爆裂的公用水管進行維修工程，令工程未能及時進行而引致大廈停止食水供應的個案，有關詳情如下：




日期
大廈
個案詳情


二○二四年六月
石塘咀一綜合大廈
位於地鋪後巷的公用水管於六月爆裂，導致地鋪嚴重水浸。基於公眾安全考慮，水務署截斷供水並即時向地舖及住宅單位用戶提供臨時食水。水務署其後提供技術支援予相關的地鋪業主及其他住宅單位業主以商討解決方案，水管維修工程並於同年六月完成。


二○二五年九月
上環荷李活道一綜合大廈
位於大廈地鋪內的公用水管嚴重漏水，影響到附近的公眾樓梯，基於公眾安全考慮，水務署截斷供水並向地鋪及住宅單位用戶即時提供臨時食水。中西區民政事務處及區議員已致力斡旋，但考慮到業主需時達成共識以聘請承辦商，為盡快讓居民的食水供應恢復正常，水務署根據《水務設施條例》第17（3）條賦予的權力，代用戶就該段出現滲漏的水管進行維修工程，工程預計在十月內完成。




（四）根據《建築物條例》，屋宇署會先行發出法定命令，要求業主拆除僭建物或修葺失修私人樓宇或排水渠。如業主缺乏籌組能力導致命令久未遵從，屋宇署會考慮進行代辦工程，並向業主收回工程費用、監督費及附加費。另一方面，如發現有明顯危險或緊急情況，而業主又無法籌組緊急維修，不論是否涉及法定命令，屋宇署均會主動介入，根據《建築物條例》安排政府承建商進行緊急工程，先將危險移除，然後向業主收回工程費用及監督費。

至於水務署方面，《水務設施條例》第17（4）條賦權如用戶或代理人收到水務署發出的維修通知書而並無進行通知書內指明的維修工程時，水務署可進行該等維修工程，有關費用則由該用戶或代理人繳付。此外，《水務設施條例》第17（3）條亦賦權水務署可應用戶或代理人要求而更改或修理內部供水系統或公用供水系統，有關費用須由要求進行該等更改或修理的人繳付。水務署會檢視每宗個案的實際情況，以決定是否會根據《水務設施條例》相關條款代用戶或代理人進行維修工程，主要考慮包括有關單位業主能否於短時間內組職起來聘請承辦商（例如「三無大廈」）、供水系統是否涉及重要設施（例如醫院及機場等），及進行維修工程時會否涉及其他較複雜的工程（例如道路工程）。"

大家好！非常高興來到澳門，出席第三屆粵港澳大灣區人才高質量發展大會，與各位共同見證這項重要盛事的開幕。能夠在這個美麗的、充滿活力與文化底蘊的城市，與來自粵港澳三地的政府代表、業界精英、學術領袖齊聚一堂，共同探討人才發展的未來方向，實在令人振奮。

發展大會向來由廣東省政府、香港特區政府及澳門特區政府三方共同主辦。第一第二屆大會分別於二○二三年和二○二四年在廣州及香港舉行。今年的第三屆大會由澳門接力舉辦，充分體現粵港澳三地在人才政策上的緊密協作，也彰顯中央政府在「一國兩制」方針下對粵港澳協同發展的堅定支持。人才是推動社會進步和經濟發展的核心動力，是建設高質量灣區的關鍵因素。三地政府攜手舉辦此項盛會，通過凝聚共識、整合資源、共建平台，肯定會更有力發展和推動人才政策，加速大灣區的高質量發展。

香港特區政府自二○二二年底推出多項措施，吸引和便利世界各地的人才匯集香港。截至今年九月，我們已吸引超過24萬不同界別的全球精英來到香港工作和發展，當中包括透過高端人才通行證計劃來港的99000多位高端人才，構建起國際人才集聚高地，為香港、國家的高質量發展，和加快現代化強國建設作出更大貢獻。

香港特區政府會繼續善用中央政府支持香港發展的各項惠港政策，例如實施「南下」人才和商務簽注、「北上」一簽多行簽證，以及向非中國籍香港永久性居民簽發《港澳居民來往內地通行證（非中國籍）》等，持續優化人才引進制度及配套措施，推動與粵港澳大灣區及主要內地城市的協同發展，共同建設國家高水平人才高地。香港特區政府已先後與北京市、上海市、廣東省、澳門特別行政區、大灣區內地九市、前海和南沙相關單位簽訂七份人才合作備忘錄，涵蓋聯合招才、政策對接、活動共辦等範疇，並積極促進學術、科研及創科領域的深度交流與合作。

憑藉「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，香港會不懈的發揮國際化平台作用，深化區域協作，拓展人才網絡，進一步夯實在引才、聚才、育才方面的綜合能力，為國家高質量發展增添人力動能。為發揮好香港聯通內地與世界、匯聚全球人才的功能，我們今年四月聯同近40家大灣區知名企業，在馬來西亞吉隆坡舉辦粵港澳大灣區人才匯聚發展推介會，及在六月舉辦共建國家高水平人才高地交流會，並得到熱烈的反應和圓滿的成功。

在今次大會，香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）很榮幸能聯同多位業界代表及企業設立展位，宣傳香港的招攬人才措施，與現場人才深入交流、解答疑問，並介紹金融科技、銀行、電訊科技等行業的發展機遇。藉此機會，我很高興給大家報告，人才辦將於明年三月於香港舉辦全球人才高峰會周。活動以國際人才論壇及人才博覽展為主軸，並於期間舉辦連串與人才及人力資源相關的大型活動，匯聚世界各地和內地政商學以及其他界別領袖，就教育、科技、人才一體化發展互相交流和分享經驗。我誠邀大灣區各兄弟城市蒞臨出席，積極參與和交流。我們深信，只要三地同心協力、攜手並進、持續創新，加快建設大灣區人才高地，我們定能實現互利共贏，為國家發展注入源源不絕的人才動力。

最後，我祝本屆大會圓滿成功，祝各位身體健康、事事順利。謝謝大家！"

發展大會向來由廣東省政府、香港特區政府及澳門特區政府三方共同主辦。第一第二屆大會分別於二○二三年和二○二四年在廣州及香港舉行。今年的第三屆大會由澳門接力舉辦，充分體現粵港澳三地在人才政策上的緊密協作，也彰顯中央政府在「一國兩制」方針下對粵港澳協同發展的堅定支持。人才是推動社會進步和經濟發展的核心動力，是建設高質量灣區的關鍵因素。三地政府攜手舉辦此項盛會，通過凝聚共識、整合資源、共建平台，肯定會更有力發展和推動人才政策，加速大灣區的高質量發展。

香港特區政府自二○二二年底推出多項措施，吸引和便利世界各地的人才匯集香港。截至今年九月，我們已吸引超過24萬不同界別的全球精英來到香港工作和發展，當中包括透過高端人才通行證計劃來港的99000多位高端人才，構建起國際人才集聚高地，為香港、國家的高質量發展，和加快現代化強國建設作出更大貢獻。

香港特區政府會繼續善用中央政府支持香港發展的各項惠港政策，例如實施「南下」人才和商務簽注、「北上」一簽多行簽證，以及向非中國籍香港永久性居民簽發《港澳居民來往內地通行證（非中國籍）》等，持續優化人才引進制度及配套措施，推動與粵港澳大灣區及主要內地城市的協同發展，共同建設國家高水平人才高地。香港特區政府已先後與北京市、上海市、廣東省、澳門特別行政區、大灣區內地九市、前海和南沙相關單位簽訂七份人才合作備忘錄，涵蓋聯合招才、政策對接、活動共辦等範疇，並積極促進學術、科研及創科領域的深度交流與合作。

憑藉「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，香港會不懈的發揮國際化平台作用，深化區域協作，拓展人才網絡，進一步夯實在引才、聚才、育才方面的綜合能力，為國家高質量發展增添人力動能。為發揮好香港聯通內地與世界、匯聚全球人才的功能，我們今年四月聯同近40家大灣區知名企業，在馬來西亞吉隆坡舉辦粵港澳大灣區人才匯聚發展推介會，及在六月舉辦共建國家高水平人才高地交流會，並得到熱烈的反應和圓滿的成功。

在今次大會，香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）很榮幸能聯同多位業界代表及企業設立展位，宣傳香港的招攬人才措施，與現場人才深入交流、解答疑問，並介紹金融科技、銀行、電訊科技等行業的發展機遇。藉此機會，我很高興給大家報告，人才辦將於明年三月於香港舉辦全球人才高峰會周。活動以國際人才論壇及人才博覽展為主軸，並於期間舉辦連串與人才及人力資源相關的大型活動，匯聚世界各地和內地政商學以及其他界別領袖，就教育、科技、人才一體化發展互相交流和分享經驗。我誠邀大灣區各兄弟城市蒞臨出席，積極參與和交流。我們深信，只要三地同心協力、攜手並進、持續創新，加快建設大灣區人才高地，我們定能實現互利共贏，為國家發展注入源源不絕的人才動力。

最後，我祝本屆大會圓滿成功，祝各位身體健康、事事順利。謝謝大家！"
立法會一題：促進金融市場發展的措施,2025-10-22 13:04,2025-10-22 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200343.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上譚岳衡議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的答覆：

問題：

據報今年首九個月香港的首次公開招股集資額已比去年同期上升逾百分之二百。關於促進金融市場發展的措施，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否因應來自不同司法管轄區的企業，制訂靈活的資訊披露標準和上市過渡安排，以吸引更多國際企業赴港上市，從而提升香港資本市場的國際地位，並吸引更多資金流入；

（二）會否持續推動交易所買賣基金（ETF）市場的金融科技發展及產品多樣化，例如利用區塊鏈技術開拓創新的市場基建及提供更多全球化的ETF產品，以將香港打造成國際領先的ETF交易中心；及

（三）據報自GEM（前稱「創業板」）於去年實施改革措施後，共有四家企業在GEM上市，而今年於GEM上市的新股更錄得超額逾9 000倍的認購，政府是否知悉，香港交易及結算所有限公司有否評估GEM的改革成效，以及會如何持續優化整體上市制度，以打造一個更健康及可持續發展的資本市場？

答覆：

主席：

香港作為國際金融中心，政府一直推動證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）和香港交易及結算所有限公司（港交所）善用「一國兩制」下背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，包括就證券市場不同範疇進行改革，推出多項上市制度優化，推動市場高質量發展。

在一系列上市制度革新的帶動下，香港新股市場今年首三季已迎來69家新上市公司，首次公開招股集資額超過1,800億港元，較去年同期上升超過兩倍，位列全球首位。上市申請個案亦正快速增加，港交所於九月底正處理近300宗上市申請。此外，GEM市場自二○二四年改革以來共有四家企業上市，融資額達2.8億港元。今年以來共收到11家中小企業申請在GEM上市，可見早前的措施初見成效。把握二○二五年勢頭持續向好，港交所和證監會正推進進一步的制度優化，以增強香港市場的活力和競爭力。

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢證監會和港交所後，我回覆如下：

（一）及（三）香港作為連接全球和國家的「超級聯繫人」，發揮高效雙向連接國際資本和內地資產的功能。國際機構投資者廣泛參與香港首次公開招股市場，今年以來更多海外包括來自泰國、印尼、哈薩克斯坦、新加坡等地的發行人選擇在港上市。國際參與也吸引內地企業加快透過香港市場進行海外布局，年初以來至九月底，有超過一半赴港上市的公司有國際化業務布局，這些企業平均約一半收入來自海外市場。

政府會繼續推動證監會和港交所優化上市機制，吸引來自世界各地具發展潛力的企業來港上市融資。就此，港交所已優化海外發行人的上市規定，引入一套適用於所有發行人的核心股東保障水平並刊發指引以便利合規。就在海外上市的企業，港交所已為它們在港進行雙重主要上市或第二上市建立便利的路徑，包括放寬沒有不同投票權架構的大中華發行人在港第二上市的市值要求；並給予擁有不同投票權或可變利益實體結構而符合第二上市規定的合資格發行人更大靈活性在港獲得主要上市地位。港交所亦自二○二三年先後將多家來自中東和東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）地區的交易所納入其認可證券交易所範圍，便利在相關主板市場上市的公司可在香港第二上市。此外，港交所亦制定靈活的資訊披露標準和過渡安排，包括在適當情況下讓海外發行人在編制年度財務報表時採用香港或國際財務報告準則以外其他獲港交所認可的準則，以及為由第二上市轉換至雙重主要上市的發行人授予全面遵守《上市規則》的寬限期，為海外發行人提供便利。

為增強香港作為上市地的競爭力，證監會和港交所一直持續審視各項上市改革的成效並積極跟進《行政長官2025年施政報告》中提出的各項措施，包括在平衡相關風險和對投資者的保障下進一步完善上市制度的各個層面，研究優化「同股不同權」上市規定。研究亦會在GEM改革的基礎上進一步探討如何更好服務不同類型和規模的企業的融資需要，及吸引更多投資者及資本進入香港市場。港交所會按「成熟一項、推出一項」原則就優化建議適時對外公布，並進行公眾諮詢。

（二）環球交易所買賣基金（ETF）市場近年迅速發展，協助投資者有效分散投資組合、涵蓋多元資產類別及投資策略。政府一直推動本地ETF市場發展，分別於二○一五年和二○二○年起豁免ETF二級市場交易和市場莊家在參與發行及贖回ETF單位過程中的股票買賣印花稅，降低相關交易和上市成本。二○二二年，ETF獲納入「滬深港通」機制，讓香港及海外投資者可買賣在上海及深圳交易所上市的合資格ETF，同時讓內地投資者可投資在香港上市的合資格ETF。

與此同時，我們積極壯大本地的ETF生態圈。自二○二三年，我們迎來多項產品創新，包括亞洲首隻追蹤沙特阿拉伯市場的ETF於香港上市，以及兩隻追蹤港股的ETF在沙特交易所以聯接基金方式上市，建立兩地資本雙向流通的橋樑。去年，港交所推出亞洲首批虛擬資產現貨ETF及香港首批備兌認購期權ETF，滿足投資者對非傳統資產、應對潛在市場波動及對沖下行風險的需求。今年，我們亦迎來全球第五大市值的ETF來港跨境上市，以及首隻伊斯蘭債券ETF在港上市。

憑藉相關政策支持，香港已發展成為亞洲最大及最活躍的ETF市場之一，吸引眾多發行人、市場莊家及投資者參與。二○二五年首三季，香港市場ETF的平均每日成交額達342億港元，較二○二四年全年平均躍升百分之一百一十三，較二○二三年全年平均更上升百分之一百九十。截至九月底，香港ETF市場的資產管理規模已達到6,254億港元。

我們期望與各持份者緊密合作，致力推出更多創新產品，包括推動代幣化ETF產品的發行和交易及協助發行人發行黃金相關ETF，繼續強化香港作為全方位領先ETF交易中心的地位。我們亦支持港交所進一步加強在東盟和中東的推廣工作，積極與區內國家探索包括ETF上市方面的合作空間，將進一步豐富本地ETF生態圈。

多謝主席。"
LCQ1: Measures to promote development of financial market,2025-10-22 13:04,2025-10-22 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200344.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Tan Yueheng and a reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  It has been reported that the funds raised through initial public offerings in Hong Kong in the first nine months of this year has increased by over 200 per cent as compared with the same period last year. Regarding measures to promote the development of the financial market, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will, in the light of enterprises from different jurisdictions, establish flexible information disclosure standards and transitional arrangements for listing to attract more international enterprises to list in Hong Kong, thereby elevating the international status of Hong Kong's capital market and drawing greater capital inflow;

(2) whether it will continue to promote fintech development and product diversification of the exchange traded fund (ETF) market, such as exploring innovative market infrastructure with the use of blockchain technology and offering more globalised ETF products, with a view to developing Hong Kong into a leading international ETF trading hub; and

(3) as it has been reported that since the implementation of the GEM (formerly known as ""Growth Enterprise Market"") reform measures last year, a total of four enterprises have listed on GEM, and a new listing on GEM this year has even recorded an oversubscription of over 9 000 times, whether the Government knows if the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited has assessed the effectiveness of the GEM reforms, and how it will continue to refine the overall listing regime for developing a healthier and sustainable capital market?

Reply:

President,

  With Hong Kong as an international financial centre, the Government is driving the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) to better leverage our unique advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under ""one country, two systems"". This includes taking forward reforms across different areas of the securities market and implementing various enhancements to the listing regime to promote high-quality market development.

  With the implementation of a series of listing reforms, Hong Kong's primary market saw 69 newly listed companies in the first three quarters of 2025 with over HK$180 billion raised through initial public offerings (IPO), representing an increase of over two times compared to the same period last year and ranking first globally. The number of listing applications is also surging. The HKEX was processing close to 300 listing applications as of end-September. In addition, four companies were listed on GEM since its reform in 2024, raising HK$280 million. 11 applications from small and medium enterprises for listing on GEM have been received so far this year, indicating that the earlier measures are beginning to yield results. Riding on the positive momentum in 2025, the HKEX and the SFC are taking forward further institutional enhancements to strengthen the vibrancy and competitiveness of Hong Kong's market.

  In consultation with the SFC and the HKEX, my reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) and (3) As a ""super connector"" between the world and our country, Hong Kong serves the function to facilitate efficient two-way flows of international and Mainland capital. International institutional investors have wide participation in Hong Kong's IPO market. More overseas issuers, including those from Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, etc, have chosen to list in Hong Kong this year. International participation has also attracted Mainland enterprises to accelerate their global expansion through Hong Kong's market. Since the beginning of the year until end-September, over half of the companies listing in Hong Kong have international businesses, with about 50 per cent of their revenue generated from overseas markets.

 The Government will continue to drive the SFC and the HKEX to refine the listing mechanism for attracting enterprises with growth potential from around the world to list and raise funds in Hong Kong. To this end, the HKEX enhanced the listing requirements for overseas issuers by introducing a set of core shareholder protection standards applicable to all issuers and publishing guidance to facilitate compliance. For enterprises listed overseas, the HKEX established facilitative pathways for them to seek dual-primary or secondary listing in Hong Kong. This includes relaxing the market capitalisation requirement for Greater China issuers without weighted voting rights (WVR) structures to secondary list in Hong Kong, and offering greater flexibility for eligible issuers with WVR or variable interest entity structures which meet the requirements for secondary listing to obtain primary listing status in Hong Kong. The HKEX has also included a number of exchanges from the Middle East and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region onto its list of recognised stock exchanges successively since 2023, facilitating companies listed on relevant markets to seek secondary listing in Hong Kong. In addition, the HKEX has formulated flexible information disclosure standards and transitional arrangements to provide facilitation to overseas issuers, such as where appropriate, permitting overseas issuers to prepare annual financial statements using standards as recognised by the HKEX other than Hong Kong or international financial reporting standards, and granting grace periods for full compliance with the Listing Rules for issuers transitioning from secondary to dual-primary listings.

  To strengthen Hong Kong's competitiveness as a listing venue, the SFC and the HKEX have been continuously assessing the effectiveness of the listing reforms and actively following up on various initiatives outlined in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address. They include further refining different aspects of the listing regime while balancing relevant risks and investor protection, and reviewing the listing requirements for companies with WVR structures. The review will also further explore ways to better serve the fundraising needs of enterprises of different types and sizes on the basis of the GEM reform, as well as attracting more investors and capital to enter Hong Kong's market. The HKEX will announce relevant enhancement measures with public consultation to be conducted as appropriate once they are ready.

(2) The global exchange-traded fund (ETF) market has grown rapidly in recent years, facilitating investors to diversify their investment portfolios across different asset classes and strategies effectively. The Government is committed to supporting the development of local ETF market. We have waived the stamp duty on secondary market trading of ETFs and stock transactions by market makers in the course of creating and redeeming ETF units since 2015 and 2020 respectively, thereby lowering relevant trading and listing costs. In 2022, ETFs were included under Stock Connect, allowing Hong Kong and overseas investors to trade eligible ETFs listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, and enabling Mainland investors to invest in eligible ETFs listed in Hong Kong.

  Meanwhile, we proactively expand the local ETF ecosystem. Since 2023, we saw various product innovations, including the listing of Asia's first ETF tracking the Saudi Arabia market in Hong Kong, and the listing of two ETFs tracking Hong Kong stocks on Saudi Exchange in the form of feeder funds, establishing a bridge for two-way capital flows between the two places. Last year, the HKEX launched Asia's first batch of spot virtual asset ETFs and Hong Kong's first batch of covered call ETFs, catering to investors' demand for non-traditional assets as well as tools to manage potential market volatility and hedge downside risks. This year, we also welcomed the cross-border listing of the world's fifth-largest ETF by market capitalisation and the listing of the first Islamic bond ETF in Hong Kong.

  With strong policy support, Hong Kong has developed into one of Asia's largest and most active ETF markets, attracting participation of a wide range of issuers, market makers and investors. In the first three quarters of 2025, the average daily turnover of ETFs in Hong Kong reached HK$34.2 billion, up 113 per cent from the full-year average in 2024 and 190 per cent from the full-year average in 2023. As of end-September, assets under management in Hong Kong's ETF market reached HK$625.4 billion.

  We look forward to working closely with different stakeholders, striving to introduce more innovative products including promoting the issuance and trading of tokenised ETFs and assisting issuers to issue gold-related ETFs, thereby further reinforcing Hong Kong's position as an all-rounded leading ETF trading hub. We also support the HKEX's efforts to further step up its promotional work in ASEAN and the Middle East, and to actively explore collaboration opportunities with countries in the region including ETF listings to further enrich the local ETF ecosystem.

  Thank you, President."

He will depart for Beijing later today for a visit.

This year's joint session focused on how APEC member economies can seize the opportunities and address the challenges brought about by AI and digital transformation through policy co-ordination, regulatory reforms, capacity building and regional co-operation. The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, also attended the session.

At the meeting, Mr Chan shared Hong Kong, China's experience in developing AI and advancing digital transformation, and offered suggestions on APEC's work in this regard. He noted that AI and digital transformation are among the most transformative forces of today. Hong Kong, China has adopted a dual strategy of developing AI as a core industry and empowering industries through AI, with efforts focused on five key areas: computing power, algorithms, application scenarios, data and funding support.

Mr Chan noted that Hong Kong, China has invested over HK$200 billion in innovation and technology, with AI development being a key focus. Major initiatives include the establishment of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute to promote upstream innovation and cross-sectoral applications of AI, as well as the launch of the AI Supercomputing Centre last year to provide computing resources to universities, research institutions and enterprises through funding schemes.

On regulation and governance, Mr Chan said that Hong Kong is committed to developing a framework for the responsible use of AI. Relevant initiatives include the issuance of the Policy Statement on Responsible Application of Artificial Intelligence in Financial Market, as well as the EthicalArtificial Intelligence Framework and the Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline, both of which are aligned with international best practices. Internally, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has set up the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team to streamline workflows through effective application of AI technologies, and is developing a Digital Corporate Identity platform to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public services.

Mr Chan stressed the importance of enhancing AI preparedness among the public to prepare for the future. Hong Kong, China is incorporating AI into all levels of education and expanding professional training programmes to comprehensively strengthen the workforce's capacity for the AI era. At the same time, Hong Kong is actively attracting top global talent in relevant fields. Furthermore, the city places strong emphasis on supporting the digital transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises, rolling out various funding schemes and support measures to help businesses adopt emerging technologies and enhance competitiveness.

In conclusion, Mr Chan proposed that APEC should strengthen co-operation in three key areas: (1) capacity building, knowledge and experience sharing, and technical support, especially to assist emerging and developing economies in bridging the digital divide; (2) deepening co-operation on digital governance by promoting policy dialogue on AI regulatory frameworks, cross-border data flows and digital trade; and (3) advancing the regional innovation and technology ecosystem to support start-ups and cross-border research and collaboration. He reiterated Hong Kong, China's readiness to strengthen collaboration with fellow member economies to harness emerging technologies for the benefit of people and economic development of the region.

Mr Chan will depart for Beijing later today, leading a delegation comprising representatives from the Government, academia, public organisations and the business sector to visit the Beijing subsidiary administrative centre and the Xiong'an New Area in the Hebei Province."

立法會十題：保障動物權益,2025-10-22 12:55,2025-10-22 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200282.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上郭玲麗議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

有意見認為，雖然政府近年推出多項寵物友善措施，包括增設寵物共享公園，以及《行政長官2025年施政報告》提出的容許狗隻進入食肆牌照，但政府仍可進一步研究保障動物權益的措施，以及規管動物善終服務。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年，每年相關政府部門就打擊非法動物繁殖場而進行的巡查次數，以及接獲的相關投訴和作出檢控的個案宗數為何（以表列出）；上述巡查行動中獲救的動物種類和數目為何；

（二）據報有非法動物繁殖場以不人道方式對待動物，並透過售賣動物牟取暴利，政府會否全面檢視保護動物權益的相關法例，以加強打擊該等非法行為；如會，詳情為何；

（三）鑑於《狂犬病條例》（第421章）訂明，動物畜養人如無合理解釋而棄掉其動物，即屬犯罪，政府在過去五年有否根據上述第421章的相關條文提出檢控；如有，每年成功檢控的個案宗數及相關判罰為何；如否，原因為何；及

（四）鑑於政府於二○二三年十一月二十二日回覆本人的書面質詢時表示，暫時沒有計劃就動物善終服務營辦商訂立牌照制度，但據悉現時在工業大廈提供動物火化服務仍涉及違反土地契約、公眾衞生等問題，政府會否研究制定專門法例規管該等營辦商，並重新考慮設立相關發牌機制；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何，以及會否考慮由政府或其指定的承辦商直接提供動物火化服務？

答覆：

主席：

就郭玲麗議員的提問，經諮詢發展局和相關政府部門後，現回覆如下：

（一）現時經營繁育狗隻並出售該等狗隻或其後代的處所，必須按《公眾衞生（動物及禽鳥）（售賣及繁育）規例》（第139B章）申領有效的繁育狗隻牌照並遵從牌照條件和營業守則。無牌經營上述處所最高可處罰款十萬元，違反牌照或許可證條件最高可處罰款五萬元。

漁農自然護理署（漁護署）會定期巡查繁育狗隻的持牌處所，如發現違規情況會作出檢控。過去五年相關巡查數字載列於附件。另一方面，漁護署會按投訴和風險評估調查懷疑非法繁育狗隻作出售用途的處所，過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年）署方分別接獲22、11、18、26和22宗投訴，經調查後並沒有發現違法的情況，亦沒有因為發現殘酷對待動物而需撿取該些處所的動物。

（二）根據《防止殘酷對待動物條例》（第169章）（《條例》），任何人作出或不作出某種行爲而導致動物受到不必要的痛苦，可構成觸犯殘酷對待動物罪行；一經定罪，最高可判處罰款二十萬元及監禁三年。政府絕不容忍殘酷對待動物的行為，會針對違法行為嚴厲執法，以保障動物福利。

我們正就《條例》的修訂作出研究，在籌備修訂《條例》的草案時，須就部分建議再徵詢相關持份者。持份者對於應否在現階段引入「謹慎責任」，以及殘酷對待動物罰則的水平持不同意見。我們會繼續收集和考慮各方意見。一俟完成有關工作，我們會向立法會交代相關工作的未來路向。

（三）根據《狂犬病條例》（第421章）第22條，動物畜養人如無合理解釋而棄掉其動物，最高可處罰款一萬元和監禁六個月。如有足夠證據（如有目擊證人或閉路電視片段）漁護署會向涉嫌人士提出檢控，否則漁護署一般會按情況視之為畜養人未有在公眾地方妥善控制其狗隻以致狗隻走失，並根據《狂犬病條例》第23條提出檢控。過去五年，該署並無按《狂犬病條例》第22條提出檢控，而按第23條成功檢控的宗數表列如下：

（四）在收到有動物火化營運處所涉及衞生滋擾、環境污染或火警危險的投訴時，食物環境衞生署（食環署）、環境保護署和消防處均會分別根據現有法例進行巡查，並按需要採取執法行動。

此外，動物火化營運商須確保其營運場所符合地契條款。一般工業大廈（工廈）訂明地段只可作工業及／或倉庫用途，於工廈進行動物火化屬違反地契條款，而且動物火化和相關服務連帶的顧客人流亦可能引起公眾安全風險。地政總署如接獲涉及違反地契條款的投訴，會跟進巡查；如證明屬實，署方會採取適當的土地執管行動。一般而言，倘若有關人士向地政總署申請修訂地契或豁免，以便容許作動物火化用途，署方須諮詢相關部門。

由於現時已有法例規管動物火化營運商，而市民亦可將離世的寵物屍體在妥善包裹和註明後交給食環署公眾垃圾收集站的職員處理，政府並無計劃提供寵物屍體火化服務，或另行制定專門法例規管這服務。"
LCQ10: Safeguarding the rights and interests of animals,2025-10-22 12:55,2025-10-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200286.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lillian Kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

 There are views that while the Government has introduced various pet-friendly measures in recent years, including the establishment of more Inclusive Parks for Pets and a licensing arrangement proposed in the 2025 Policy Address for allowing dogs to enter food premises, the Government can still further explore measures to safeguard the rights and interests of animals and regulate animal hospice services. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of inspections conducted by the relevant Government departments to crack down on illegal animal breeding facilities, as well as the numbers of related complaints received and prosecutions instituted, in each of the past five years (set out in a table); the types and numbers of animals rescued in the aforesaid inspections;

(2) as it has been reported that there are illegal animal breeding facilities treating animals inhumanely and profiteering through the sale of animals, whether the Government will comprehensively review the legislation relating to the protection of the rights and interests of animals, so as to step up efforts in combating such illegal acts; if so, of the details;

(3) as the Rabies Ordinance (Cap. 421) provides that a keeper of any animal who, without reasonable excuse, abandons that animal commits an offence, whether the Government has instituted any prosecutions under the aforesaid relevant provision of Cap. 421 over the past five years; if so, of the number of successful prosecutions and the relevant penalties imposed in each of the years; if not, the reasons for that; and

(4) as the Government indicated in its reply to my written question on November 22, 2023 that it had no plan to introduce a licensing regime for animal hospice service operators back then, but it is learnt that currently the provision of animal cremation services in industrial buildings still involves issues such as breaches of land leases and public health concerns, whether the Government will study the enactment of dedicated legislation to regulate such operators, and reconsider introducing a relevant licensing mechanism; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that, and whether consideration will be given to providing animal cremation services directly by the Government or its designated contractors?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Development Bureau and the relevant Government departments, the reply to the question from the Hon Lillian Kwok is as follows:

(1) Currently, any person who operates a dog breeding premises and sells those dogs or their offspring must possess a valid Dog Breeder Licence in accordance with the Public Health (Animals and Birds) (Trading and Breeding) Regulations (Cap. 139B), and must comply with the relevant licence conditions and the code of practice. Operating the above premises without a valid licence is subject to a maximum fine of $100,000, while non-compliance with the licence conditions or permit conditions is subject to a maximum fine of $50,000.

 The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) conducts regular inspections to licensed dog breeding premises. Prosecutions will be instigated against any violation identified. The inspection figures in the past five years are set out in Annex. Furthermore, based on complaints and risk assessments, the AFCD conducts investigation on premises suspected of illegal dog breeding activities for sale purpose. In the past five years (2020 to 2024), the department respectively received 22, 11, 18, 26, and 22 complaints. After investigation, no illegal activity was detected, nor was it necessary to seize the animals from detection of animal cruelty.

(2) According to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance (Cap. 169) (the Ordinance), anyone who does or omits to do any act and causes any unnecessary suffering to any animal may constitute an offence of animal cruelty. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty is a fine of $200,000 and imprisonment for three years. The Government will not tolerate any act of animal cruelty and takes stringent enforcement actions against illegal act to safeguard animal welfare.

 We have been studying amendments to the Ordinance. In preparing the bill to amend the Ordinance, it is necessary to consult the relevant stakeholders again on some of the proposals. There are divergent views among stakeholders on the introduction of ""Duty of Care"" at this stage and the penalty level for animal cruelty. We will continue to collect and consider the opinions from all parties. Once the work is completed, we will present the way forward of the relevant work to the Legislative Council.

(3) According to Section 22 of the Rabies Ordinance (Cap. 421), a keeper of any animal who, without reasonable excuse, abandons that animal, is subject to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months. When there is sufficient evidence (such as eye-witness accounts or CCTV footage), the AFCD will instigate prosecution against the suspect. Otherwise, the AFCD generally, depending on the circumstances, regards the keeper as failing to keep that animal under control and causing that animal to wander into a public place, and will instigate prosecution in accordance to Section 23 of the Rabies Ordinance. In the past five years, no prosecution was instigated in accordance with Section 22, while the number of successful prosecutions under Section 23 are tabulated below:




Year
Number of Successful Prosecutions


2020
103


2021
130


2022
121


2023
90


2024
85




(4) Upon receipt of complaints about animal cremation operating premises causing sanitary nuisance, environmental pollution or fire hazard, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Environmental Protection Department and Fire Services Department will respectively conduct inspection and take enforcement action as necessary in accordance with existing legislations.

 Furthermore, animal cremation providers must ensure their operating premises comply with the terms of the land lease. In general, lots of industrial buildings (IBs) are specified for industrial and/or godown uses. Animal cremation within IBs is in breach of lease restrictions. Also, the flow of people arising from animal cremation and relevant services may pose risks to public safety. The Lands Department will conduct follow-up inspections on complaints received involving breach of lease conditions, and if verified, the department will take lease enforcement actions as appropriate. In general, if the relevant persons make an application to the Lands Department for lease modification or waiver so as to accommodate animal cremation purposes, Lands Department would consult relevant departments.

 Considering that animal cremation providers are regulated by existing legislations, and members of the public may properly wrap, label and pass the body of their deceased pets to FEHD's staff at public refuse collection points for handling, the Government has no plans to provide pet cremation services or to introduce specific legislation to regulate such services."
LCQ16: Introduction of market-based business models into LCSD facilities,2025-10-22 12:53,2025-10-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200284.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Dominic Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

The Government announced in the 2025 Policy Address its plan to introduce market-based business models into designated facilities of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) to enhance visitor experience and operational efficacy. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) how the Government will specifically implement the aforementioned plan to introduce market-based business models, and whether it will, for example, provide clear information on available dates and time slots for venue bookings, and offer short-term or long-term (such as annual) rental options;

(2) of the annual attendance, utilisation rates of various facilities, and income sources of each museum under the LCSD over the past five years; whether the Government has plans to draw upon practices at overseas tourist attractions and experience in shopping mall management to introduce cultural and creative projects, design mascots, put in place photo spots and immersive interactive exhibits at the LCSD museums and other indoor exhibition venues, and open such venues to commercial organisations for hosting guided tours, games, augmented reality (AR) experiences, festive events or themed exhibitions; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) as it is learnt that some private fitness centres have utilised facial recognition technology and intelligent systems for 24-hour operation, whether the Government will consider introducing similar technology or upgrading the existing intelligent sports and recreation services booking information system named SmartPLAY, so that all the LCSD sports centres and related facilities (such as pitches/courts and fitness rooms) can operate 24 hours a day, thereby maximising venue utilisation and achieving intelligent management; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether the Government has plans to combine market-based business models with the concept of smart outdoor parks, incorporating technological elements into outdoor recreation and sports facilities (such as utilising big data and the Internet of Things to enable members of the public to connect fitness equipment with their mobile phones to record their exercise data and physical condition, with the system then recommending personalised fitness programmes), thereby enhancing the public's experience and utilisation rates; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) whether it has further studied the feasibility of implementing market-based business models at all the LCSD facilities (including the impact on fees, service quality and public participation); if so, of the study results; if not, whether it will consider conducting relevant studies?

Reply:

President,

It is announced in the 2025 Policy Address that the Government will introduce market-based business models into designated facilities of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) to provide more diverse value-added activities, and explore the feasibility of engaging the market to enhance the operations of the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp and selected beaches with a view to developing recreational, leisure and aquatic hotspots.

My reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) and (5) The LCSD plans to make available not less than eight of its facilities, such as museums and parks (including the Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) and Kai Tak Station Square) within 2026 to introduce commercial elements and to flexibly provide more diverse value-added activities, such as leasing out museum venues on their closing days for commercial or private activities, introducing paid guided tours for visitor groups, and developing more cultural and creative products.

The LCSD plans to engage a professional operator (such as an event planning company) to leverage its market knowledge and professional expertise for marketing suitable venues to target clients, providing technical and logistical support for events, arranging exclusive guided tours of large-scale exhibitions at the LCSD museums for target groups, and providing client management services. We are now formulating the relevant details.

Regarding the operations of the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp and selected beaches, the LCSD will invite interested commercial entities or non-profit organisations to submit proposals for operating the Lei Yue Mun Park holiday camp on a commercial basis, and developing selected beaches into new recreational, leisure and aquatic venues. Interested operators are encouraged to put forward feasible proposals. The LCSD is now exploring the concrete market-based business models. Detailed arrangements as well as the fees to be charged will be subject to the nature and content of the activities, venue conditions, etc. The above initiatives are in the exploration phase, and the LCSD will assess their effectiveness in due course, including their impact on service quality, public participation and revenue.

(2) Attendance of the LCSD museums and average utilisation of museum facilities in the past five years are tabulated below:




Year
Attendance
Average utilisation of museum facilities (Note 2)


2020-21
850000 (Note 1)
76.2 per cent


2021-22
3270000 (Note 1)
78.6 per cent


2022-23
4370000 (Note 1)
76.2 per cent


2023-24
7000000
77.3 per cent


2024-25
7660000
69.5 per cent




Note 1: Due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, museums and venues under the LCSD were temporarily and intermittently closed from 2020 to 2022.
Note 2: Other than exhibition galleries and exhibition halls, museum facilities include lecture halls, activity rooms and theatres.

The LCSD museums provide broad access to cultural education and public services for the community and do not aim solely for commercial profits. Currently, apart from a low admission fee (from $10 to $20) being charged by the permanent exhibitions of the Hong Kong Science Museum and the Hong Kong Space Museum, all permanent exhibitions of other museums are open to the public for free. Major revenue sources of the LCSD museums include admission fees and rental charges for hiring facilities, sale of cultural and creative and artistic products, tickets of public programmes (such as film screenings), as well as permit/licence fees for operating shops and cafes.

The LCSD museums promote the development of the arts and cultural industries on an ongoing basis through collaborations with local brands in the cultural and creative industries. For example, we launch cross-over products with different brands this year, including the collaboration with a stationery brand during the Hong Kong ICH Month 2025 in June, where an artist with disability was invited to design stickers of 10 intangible cultural heritage items of Hong Kong, allowing customers to create personalised notebooks; releasing three limited-edition gift boxes in collaboration with a local bakery in July, with artworks from the collections of the Hong Kong Heritage Museum (HKHM) and the HKMoA for showcasing the century-old craftsmanship of the bakery and the aesthetics of our museums. Moreover, we will be partnering with two local brands to launch museum-themed brick sets and food products respectively to promote Muse Fest HK 2025 in November.

The LCSD continues to incorporate new technological elements when staging exhibitions in its museums and to set up photo-taking spots and immersive exhibits to enhance the visitor experience. For example, the ""Comic Fun for All: The Magic of Hong Kong Comedy Comics"" exhibition currently at the HKHM presents an innovative, inspiring and educational museum experience to visitors by featuring immersive projection programmes, comics viewing interactive installations, experiences with AI-generated images, as well as interactive installations for photo-taking with comic characters. The exhibition ""Legacy of Lingnan School of Painting: In Commemoration of the 120th Anniversary of the Birth of Chao Shao-an"" just opened this September at the HKHM, on the other hand, creates an immersive digital sea of flowers using Professor Chao's paintings of Lingnan scenery and bird-and-flower, guiding visitors into the vibrant world depicted in the master's works and immersing them in a wonderland of Lingnan blossoms. Furthermore, the ""Engaging Past Wisdom: Min Chiu Society at Sixty-five"" exhibition currently at the HKMoA employs holographic imaging technology to reinterpret the artefacts in three dimensions, allowing visitors to interact with the exhibits and enhancing their interest in and understanding of the artefacts.

(3) The LCSD is committed to promoting the culture of ""Sport for All"" and provides a diverse range of sports and recreational facilities to encourage the public to build a healthy lifestyle. While the fee-charging recreational facilities of the LCSD (such as fitness rooms, sports grounds and turf soccer pitches) generally open from 7am to 11pm, most non-fee charging facilities (such as some 900 sets of outdoor fitness equipment in parks and playgrounds across the territory) open 24 hours a day. The existing arrangements regarding the opening hours of sports and recreational facilities cater to the needs of most people. As adjusting the opening hours (including opening fitness rooms 24-hour a day) requires additional public resources, the LCSD has no such plans at the moment.

Regarding facility management and operation, the LCSD has been enhancing efficiency and service quality through the application of technology, such as launching the intelligent sports and recreational services booking and information system, SmartPLAY, with a dedicated website and a mobile app, in 2023, to enable members of the public in logging into personal accounts, searching and booking sports and recreational facilities, or enrolling in sports and recreational programmes anytime and anywhere. The LCSD will continue to keep an open mind to explore actively on the use of technology in assisting the management of sports and recreational facilities, thereby providing better leisure services to the public.

(4) The LCSD is introducing technology elements to park facilities to enhance the experience of the public. For instance, to provide additional novel outdoor fitness facilities suitable for use by different age groups, the LCSD is installing, on a trial basis, outdoor fitness stations with smart elements at four outdoor leisure venues, allowing users to store and retrieve data of their physical activities and access health information after using these smart fitness facilities. This will facilitate their management of personal health and monitoring of physical fitness, as well as enhance the pleasure of exercising, thereby encouraging members of the public to exercise on a regular basis. The first smart fitness station at Victoria Park has been opened for public use since March 2025. It is expected that the smart fitness stations at Hoi Fai Road Promenade in Tai Kok Tsui, Kowloon Tsai Park and Hoi Chu Road Playground in Tuen Mun will commence service within this year."
立法會十六題：在康文署設施引入市場營運模式,2025-10-22 12:52,2025-10-22 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200281.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上李梓敬議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的書面答覆：

問題：

政府於二○二五年《施政報告》公布，計劃於康樂及文化事務署（康文署）指定設施引入市場營運模式，以提升旅客體驗和經營效能。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）政府如何具體落實上述引入市場營運模式的計劃，例如會否在場地預訂方面，提供清晰的可供申請日期及時段資料，以及在租用形式方面提供短期或長期（例如按年租用）選擇等；

（二）過去五年，每年康文署轄下的每間博物館的入場人次、各項設施使用率，以及收入來源為何；政府有否計劃參考外國旅遊景點的做法及商場管理的經驗，在康文署博物館及其他室內展覽場地引入文創項目、設計吉祥物、設置打卡位及沉浸式互動展品，並開放予商業機構舉辦導賞、遊戲、擴增實境（AR）體驗，以及節慶活動或主題展覽；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（三）據悉有私營健身室已應用面部辨識技術及智能系統以實行24小時營運，政府會否考慮引入類似科技，或提升現時的智能康體服務預訂資訊系統SmartPLAY，以便所有康文署體育館及相關設施（例如球場、健身室等）可24小時開放，令場地得以充分使用，並達致智能化管理；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；

（四）政府有否計劃將市場營運模式與戶外智慧公園的概念結合，在戶外康體設施加入科技元素（例如利用大數據及物聯網等技術，讓市民連接健身器材和手機記錄自己的運動數據及身體狀況，並由系統建議個人的健體方案），從而提升市民體驗及使用率；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（五）有否進一步研究在所有康文署設施推行市場營運模式的可行性（包括對收費、服務質素及市民參與度的影響）；若有，評估結果為何；若否，會否考慮進行相關研究？

答覆：

主席：

二○二五年《施政報告》提出，政府會在康樂及文化事務署（康文署）指定設施引入市場營運模式，提供更多元的增值活動；並會探討邀請市場參與，提升鯉魚門公園度假營的營運及在指定試點營運沙灘，以建設康樂休閒及水上活動熱點。

就提問的各個部分，我現回覆如下：

（一）及（五）康文署計劃於二○二六年內選出不少於八個轄下設施，包括博物館和公園（例如香港藝術館及啟德車站廣場），引入商業元素及靈活地提供更多元的增值活動，例如在博物館閉館日出租場地舉辦商業或私人活動，推出收費的旅客團體導賞以及開發更多文創產品。

康文署計劃委聘專業營辦商（例如活動策劃公司），運用其市場和專業知識向目標客戶推廣合適的場地、為活動提供技術和後勤支援、為目標群體安排康文署博物館大型展覽的導賞專場，以及提供客戶管理服務。我們正擬備各項細節。

就鯉魚門公園度假營及指定試點營運沙灘而言，康文署會透過邀請有興趣的商業機構或非牟利機構提交建議，以商業方式營運鯉魚門公園度假營，和發展試點泳灘成新興康樂休閒及水上活動設施。我們鼓勵有意營運者提出可行的方案。康文署正研究具體的市場營運模式，各項具體安排和收費需視乎活動性質和內容、場地條件等而定。上述計劃尚在研究階段中，康文署會適時評估成效，包括對服務質素、市民參與度及收入的影響等。

（二）過去五年，康文署轄下博物館的入場人次，以及館內設施的平均使用率見下表：





入場人次
			（萬）
館內設施（註二）
			平均使用率


二○二○至二一年度
85（註一）
76.2%


二○二一至二二年度
327（註一）
78.6%


二○二二至二三年度
437（註一）
76.2%


二○二三至二四年度
700
77.3%


二○二四至二五年度
766
69.5%



註一：受到2019冠狀病毒病疫情影響，康文署轄下博物館及場地於二○二○年至二○二二年期間間歇地暫停開放。
註二：館內設施指除展覽館及展覽廳外的設施，包括演講廳、活動室、劇院等。

康文署轄下的博物館為市民提供普及的文化教育及公共服務，並非單以商業營利為目的。現時除香港科學館和香港太空館的常設展覽收取低額入場費（10元至20元）外，其他博物館的常設展覽均免費開放予市民參觀。康文署博物館的主要收入來源包括入場費及可租用設施的租用費、出售文創及文藝產品的收入、公眾節目如電影放映門票，以及商店和咖啡館的營運許可證／牌照費用的收入等。

康文署的博物館一直透過與本地文化創意產業品牌合作，推動文化藝術產業發展。舉例而言，我們於二○二五年與不同品牌推出聯乘產品，包括於六月的「香港非遺月2025」與文具品牌合作，邀請展能藝術家設計十款非遺項目的插畫，讓顧客打造自己獨特的筆記本；於七月與本地餅家聯乘推出三款限量禮盒，禮盒設計源自香港文化博物館及香港藝術館的館藏，結合百年餅藝與博物館美學。另外，就推廣十一月的香港博物館節，我們分別與兩個本地品牌合作，聯乘推出以博物館內容為題材的拼裝積木及食品。

康文署持續為轄下博物館舉辦的展覽引入嶄新的科技元素，並設置打卡位及沉浸式展品，提升參觀人士的觀賞體驗。例如，現正於香港文化博物館舉行的「漫眾同樂──幽默港漫格格趣」展覽，以沉浸式投影節目、漫畫觀賞互動裝置、AI生成影像體驗及與漫畫人物同框打卡的互動裝置等，為參觀人士帶來創新、富啟發性和教育性的博物館體驗。至於剛於今年九月開幕的「嶺南風範：趙少昂誕辰一百二十周年紀念展」，香港文化博物館利用趙少昂教授筆下的嶺南風物及花鳥，創造了一個沉浸式的數碼花海，引領參觀人士走進大師畫作中生機蓬勃和色彩絢爛的嶺南花境。另外，現正於香港藝術館舉行的「鑑古識今──敏求精舍六十五周年」展覽，亦以全息影像科技把文物立體呈現，讓參觀人士與展品互動，增加對文物的興趣與認識。

（三）康文署致力推廣「普及體育」的文化，透過提供不同種類的康樂體育設施，鼓勵市民建立健康生活模式。康文署的收費康樂設施（例如健身室、運動場及草地足球場）開放時間一般為上午七時至晚上十一時；而非收費設施（例如全港公園及遊樂場內約900套戶外健身器材），則大多24小時開放。現時康樂體育設施的開放時間安排已照顧大部分人士的需要。調整開放時間（包括將健身室通宵開放）將涉及額外的公共資源，署方暫未有計劃推行。

在設施管理和運作方面，康文署一直運用科技提升效率及服務質素，例如於二○二三年推出的智能康體服務預訂資訊系統SmartPLAY具備專題網頁及流動應用程式，方便市民隨時隨地登入個人帳戶、搜尋及預訂康體設施，或報名參加康體活動。康文署會繼續持開放態度積極探討運用科技協助管理康體設施，為市民提供更優質的康樂服務。

（四）康文署正在公園設施引入科技元素，以優化市民的體驗。舉例而言，為了提供更多新穎及適合不同年齡人士的戶外健身設施，康文署正在四個戶外康樂場地推展試行計劃，安裝具智能元素的戶外健身站，讓使用者可在使用智能健身設施後存取個人運動數據及健康資訊，方便管理個人健康、監察個人體質和增加運動的樂趣，從而鼓勵市民恆常運動。首個設於維多利亞公園的智能健身站已於二○二五年三月開放予市民使用，而位於大角咀海輝道海濱花園、九龍仔公園和屯門海珠路遊樂場的智能健身站預計於本年度內投入服務。"
Speech by Acting SJ at Annual Conference of In-House Lawyers 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-10-22 12:46,2025-10-22 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200368.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Annual Conference of In-House Lawyers 2025 today (October 22):

President Tong, (President of the Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Roden Tong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. I am honoured to be here at the Annual Conference of In-House Lawyers 2025. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the In-House Lawyers Committee of the Law Society of Hong Kong for the invitation and for hosting this important event. With participants from diverse industries and jurisdictions, we bring together the brightest minds of the legal profession here today, which will surely enrich our discussions throughout the Conference.

  This year's theme, ""The Future of Lawyers: Innovation, Strategy, and Resilience"", captures a moment of profound significance. It reflects the evolving nature of the legal field, driven by technological advancements, shifting client expectations, and a dynamic global marketplace. These changes present both challenges and opportunities.

  As in-house lawyers, you stand at the forefront of this exciting transformation. Your role extends beyond traditional legal advisors; you are also strategic innovators within your organisations.

  In January, the Department of Justice made a significant move to advance lawtech by establishing the Consultation Group on LawTech Development. Building on their recommendations, we will progressively promote technology in the legal industry through a three-stage approach, with the aim of enhancing the efficiency and quality of professional services and strengthening Hong Kong's position as an international legal services and dispute resolution centre in the Asia-Pacific region.

  Phase one, which has already begun, focuses on raising awareness and education of lawtech within the legal profession by organising roundtables and events, to be accompanied by a roadmap, ethical and security guidelines. To prepare law students for the digital age, we work with stakeholders in legal education to enhance training on lawtech.

  Phase two will engage the legal profession with lawtech products through exhibitions and market surveys. This will help firms find solutions that support their business growth.

Finally, phase three will encourage local and international lawtech enterprises to establish a presence in Hong Kong, fostering a vibrant lawtech ecosystem. We will also periodically review the legal framework to ensure it supports and regulates new legal technologies effectively.

  Turning to the theme of the Conference, let's first talk about innovation in legal practice. Technology is now a vital part of legal work. From AI assisting in contract analysis to blockchain enhancing transaction security, the tools at our disposal are transforming how we manage cases. By using these innovations, we can work more efficiently, cut costs, and provide better services.

  Next, innovation must be strategic. In-house lawyers are not only legal advisors but also key contributors to their organisations' strategic direction. This means understanding the broader issues and context in which they operate, aligning legal strategies with organisational objectives, and proactively identifying and mitigating legal risks.

As in-house lawyers, you must rigorously evaluate not only the technological solutions available but also the specific needs of your organisation. Tailoring these innovations to your unique context will ensure that they serve to maximise your professional capabilities.

  Finally, let us talk about resilience - the ability to adapt amid challenges. The legal landscape is filled with uncertainties, from regulatory changes, evolving market dynamics, to emerging competitors. We must cultivate resilience within our teams and organisations by fostering an environment that encourages creativity, and supporting colleagues in developing skills that complement technological advancements.

  In the Greater China region and beyond, we are witnessing a significant transformation in the legal landscape. The convergence of industries and the rise of cross-border transactions require in-house lawyers to be well-versed in international laws and regulations. This Conference presents an excellent opportunity to connect with peers across different sectors and jurisdictions, exchanging best practices and insights that can enhance our collective capabilities.

  As we move through today's panel discussions, we will be engaging in interesting discussions on the future of legal practice, the implications of AI, and the ever-evolving landscape of data governance. I encourage all of you to join in, share your thoughts, and challenge the status quo. Together, we can forge a path forward that not only meets today's challenges but also prepares us for the future.

  To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, as an in-house lawyer, I am excited to see how each of you will harness innovation, strategy and resilience to enhance your legal practice. Once again, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Law Society of Hong Kong for organising this very special event to bring all these legal talents together. I wish you all a successful, enjoyable and fruitful discussion at the Conference. Thank you very much."

為便利渡輪服務的日常運作，政府為大部分持牌渡輪航線提供渡輪碼頭。紅磡渡輪碼頭分為紅磡（南）及紅磡（北）渡輪碼頭，分別由富裕小輪有限公司營辦的「中環－紅磡」持牌渡輪航線及新渡輪服務有限公司營辦的「北角－紅磡」持牌渡輪航線提供服務。

政府一直與海濱事務委員會緊密合作，推動各項優化維港海濱的工作，為公眾營造多元、活力、暢達和共融的海濱空間，包括毗鄰紅磡渡輪碼頭一帶的海濱用地。

就李慧琼議員的提問，經諮詢發展局及文化體育及旅遊局後，現回覆如下：

（一）為推動海濱經濟，規劃署於二○二五年八月向城市規劃委員會（城規會）建議修訂紅磡（南）及紅磡（北）渡輪碼頭在相關分區計劃大綱圖上的用途，將「商店及服務行業」和「食肆」用途改為經常准許的用途，以簡化發展流程及提供彈性，便利營商。九龍城區議會及海濱事務委員會相關小組早前均已表示支持擬議修訂。

政府一直鼓勵渡輪營辦商在符合核准土地用途的前提下，將碼頭地方分租作商業、零售和活動等用途，以賺取非票務收入補貼渡輪的營運，從而紓緩加價壓力。

就紅磡渡輪碼頭而言，運輸署一直積極統籌各工務部門持續提升該碼頭的設施，包括翻新洗手間及增設無障礙設施，以拓展碼頭的發展潛力，從而進一步提升碼頭用作非票務收入活動的空間；政府產業署亦會統籌處理營辦商提交的碼頭商業活動申請。

（二）發展局致力推動優化維港海濱的工作，包括駁通海濱段落及提供優質海濱休憩空間。現時，由尖沙咀渡輪碼頭至紅磡海逸豪園對開的海濱已全面貫通。發展局會繼續致力打通九龍其他不同的海濱地段，目標是於二○二八年年底駁通尖沙咀至啟德一帶近八成半（即約13公里）可發展海濱。

另外，毗鄰紅磡渡輪碼頭、前身為紅磡碼頭公共運輸交匯處的用地，已改建成紅磡都市公園，並於今年七月全面開放。公園以北用地由非牟利機構以短期租約形式營運兒童遊樂設施，亦即將向公眾開放，提供更多遊樂設施和空間舉辦不同活動，為紅磡一帶海濱引入更共融、更具活力的元素。

與此同時，發展局正牽頭推動港鐵紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地的發展，在今年第二季就用地公布了初步發展建議。把握重新規劃的契機，初步發展建議包括多項加強行人暢達度的建議，以帶動有關用地與附近周邊區域的協同發展，當中包括興建有蓋高架行人天橋，直接連繫港鐵紅磡站及海濱；以及興建行人板道，加強尖沙咀海濱長廊與紅磡海濱長廊的連接，並優化海濱與內陸的行人連接。發展局正為擬議發展進行詳細技術評估，以深化發展建議及敲定詳細發展參數。在過程中，項目團隊會考慮早前在公眾諮詢期間所收集到的意見。目標是在二○二六年下半年開展相關的法定程序。在開展長遠發展的工程前，發展局會善用現時閒置的前紅磡鐵路貨運碼頭用地作短期用途，發展成為可舉辦不同活動的海濱空間，讓市民「打卡」並欣賞270度維港景色及香港島的天際線。

（三）紅磡渡輪碼頭毗鄰紅磡（紅鸞道）公共運輸交匯處，同時距離黃埔花園公共運輸交匯處亦僅約十分鐘步程，設有往返港島、九龍及新界多個地區的專營巴士及專線小巴服務。就紅磡與港島的交通接駁，紅磡渡輪碼頭提供「北角－紅磡」及「中環－紅磡」持牌渡輪航線服務，為市民提供水路交通選擇。陸路交通方面，市民可在紅磡（紅鸞道）公共運輸交匯處乘搭專線小巴第13M號線（紅磡碼頭—紅磡站）至港鐵紅磡站，轉乘港鐵東鐵線前往港島；或在黃埔花園公共運輸交匯處，乘搭隧巴第115號或115P號線（海逸豪園往中環（港澳碼頭））前往港島。運輸署會密切留意乘客就紅磡渡輪碼頭對外公共運輸服務的需求，並適時與各營辦商檢視相關安排。

旅遊配套方面，維港是香港最具代表性的景點之一，現時已有一些商業營運的海上旅遊項目供旅客參與，從維港兩岸不同登岸設施上落的觀賞船暢遊維港，部分更提供餐飲服務，讓旅客在欣賞維港美景的同時品嚐美食，感受香港獨特魅力。

旅遊事務署和香港旅遊發展局會繼續善用海濱長廊和水體打造更多盛事和旅遊體驗，並致力推動、促成和協助不同旅遊盛事和活動在維港兩岸舉行。

（四）現時，紅磡渡輪碼頭上層的土地用途容許作商店及服務行業之用。運輸署正積極與渡輪營辦商商討，以協助其開放紅磡渡輪碼頭上層作商業、零售或活動等用途。

就紅磡（南）渡輪碼頭上層空間，渡輪營辦商已物色有意分租該空間作零售及服務用途的潛在租戶，並預期於稍後向政府提出有關申請。

就紅磡（北）渡輪碼頭上層空間，渡輪營辦商有意把該空間改劃作展覽廳、商店及服務行業用途，並已獲得城規會的有條件批准。就此，運輸署正積極協調相關政府部門聯同渡輪營辦商研究於碼頭裝設合適的消防系統，預計有關技術研究及設計於二○二六年第一季完成，並會在下一步評估方案細節和可行性等事宜。

運輸署會繼續與渡輪營辦商就紅磡渡輪碼頭的運作及發展保持密切溝通，包括鼓勵營辦商繼續利用碼頭拓展其非票務收入，並視乎情況考慮引入具教育及文化價值的活動項目。"
LCQ18: Development of Hung Hom Ferry Pier  ,2025-10-22 12:25,2025-10-22 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200253.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Starry Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  There are views that with its convenient transport links and scenic view, Hung Hom Ferry Pier (the Pier) has the potential to develop into a waterfront hub integrating transport, leisure, culture and creativity. However, the Pier as a whole is not being used to its full functionality, as evidenced by its upper deck area still being closed to public use, which results in the idling of some facilities and wasting of land resources. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will examine the utilisation of land and facilities at the Pier and explore introducing more commercial and leisure elements to tie in with the development of the surrounding areas, thereby promoting waterfront economy and community integration;

(2) whether it will consider enhancing the planning interface between the Pier and adjacent waterfront areas, such as through synergistic development with Whampoa, Kowloon City District and Tsim Sha Tsui East, to create a waterfront promenade and commercial circulation route with greater coherence;

(3) regarding the uplift of maritime tourism, whether it will explore how to strengthen the external transport facilities for the Pier, thereby simultaneously enhancing tourism and transport linkages between Hung Hom and Hong Kong Island; and

(4) whether it will consider opening up the upper deck of the Pier for public use and introducing activities of educational and cultural value, such as photo exhibitions showcasing the national achievements in construction, or organisation of youth cultural and creative workshops and music galas, to offer the public a more diverse waterfront experience characterized by a sense of community and a cultural vibe?

Reply:

President,

  To facilitate the daily operation of ferry services, the Government provides ferry piers for most of the licensed ferry routes. Hong Hom Ferry Pier comprises Hung Hom (South) and Hung Hom (North) Ferry Piers, serving the ""Central – Hung Hom"" licensed ferry route operated by the Fortune Ferry Company Limited and the ""North Point – Hung Hom"" licensed ferry route operated by the Sun Ferry Services Company Limited respectively.

  The Government has been working closely with the Harbourfront Commission to promote various initiatives to enhance the Victoria Harbourfront, including the harbourfront area in proximity to Hung Hom Ferry Pier, with a view to creating a diversified, vibrant, accessible and inclusive harbourfront space for the public.

  In consultation with the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, my reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Starry Lee is as follows:

(1) To promote harbourfront economy, the Planning Development proposed to the Town Planning Board (TPB) in August 2025 an amendment to the uses within Hung Hom (South) and Hung Hom (North) Ferry Piers on the outline zoning plan concerned by making the uses of ""Shop and Services"" and ""Eating Place"" always permitted, so as to streamline the development process and provide flexibility in facilitation of business operations. The Kowloon City District Council and the relevant task force of the Harbourfront Commission have already expressed their support to the proposed amendment.

  The Government has all along encouraged ferry operators to sublet pier premises for purposes such as commercial, retail and event, under the approved land uses to generate non-farebox revenue for cross-subsidising ferry operations and thereby alleviating the pressure on fare increase.

  Regarding Hung Hom Ferry Pier, the Transport Department (TD) has been actively coordinating with various works departments to continuously enhance the pier's facilities, including renovating the toilets and adding barrier-free facilities, so as to expand the pier's development potential and further enhance its capacity for non-fare revenue activities. The Government Property Agency also coordinates the processing of applications for commercial activities at the pier submitted by the operators.

(2) The DEVB is committed to taking forward harbourfront enhancements at Victoria Harbour, including connecting the harbourfront sections and providing quality harbourfront open spaces. At present, the harbourfront between Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier and Laguna Verde in Hung Hom has been fully connected. The DEVB will continue to connect other harbourfront sections in Kowloon, with the target of connecting around 85 per cent (i.e. approximately 13 kilometres) of the developable promenade from Tsim Sha Tsui to Kai Tak by the end of 2028.

  Besides, the site that was previously a public transport interchange near Hung Hom Ferry Pier has already been transformed into the Hung Hom Urban Park, which was fully opened in July this year. A site to the north of the park will be operated by a non-profit-making organisation by way of short-term tenancy for the provision of children's play facilities and opened to the public shortly. The site will provide more leisure facilities and space for hosting different activities, thereby injecting more harmonious and vibrant elements into the harbourfront in Hung Hom.

  At the same time, the DEVB is spearheading the development at the sites around MTR Hung Hom Station and its waterfront areas, and released the preliminary development proposal for the sites in the second quarter of this year. Taking the opportunity of re-planning, the preliminary development proposal includes several measures to strengthen the pedestrian connectivity with a view to driving the co-development of the concerned sites and the nearby areas. These include, for example, building a covered and elevated footbridge spanning to directly connect MTR Hung Hom Station with the harbourfront, constructing a new boardwalk to better connect the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront promenade with the Hung Hom waterfront promenade, as well as enhancing the pedestrian connectivity between the hinterland and waterfront. The DEVB is currently conducting detailed technical assessments for the proposed development so as to finalise the development proposal and detailed development parameters. During the process, the project team will consider the views collected during the public consultation conducted earlier. The aim is to commence the relevant statutory procedures for the project in the second half of 2026. Before commencing the works of the long-term development, the DEVB will make good use of the currently idle former Hung Hom Railway Freight Yard Pier site for short-term use, developing it into a harbourfront space for hosting various activities such that the public may check in and appreciate the 270-degree panoramic views of Victoria Harbour and the skyline of Hong Kong Island.

(3) Hung Hom Ferry Pier is situated adjacent to Hung Hom (Hung Luen Road) Public Transport Interchange, and is also only about a 10-minute walk from Whampoa Garden Public Transport Interchange. These interchanges offer franchised bus and green minibus (GMB) services connecting to various districts across Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories. Regarding transport connectivity between Hung Hom and Hong Kong Island, Hung Hom Ferry Pier offers licensed ferry services of the ""North Point – Hung Hom"" and ""Central – Hung Hom"" routes, providing waterborne transport options for the public. In terms of land transport, members of the public may take GMB Route No. 13M (Hung Hom Ferry Pier – Hung Hom Station) from Hung Hom (Hung Luen Road) Public Transport Interchange to MTR Hung Hom Station, and then interchange with the MTR East Rail Line towards Hong Kong Island. Alternatively, passengers may take Cross-Harbour Route No. 115 or 115P (from Laguna Verde to Central (Hong Kong – Macau Ferry Terminal)) at Whampoa Garden Public Transport Interchange to travel to Hong Kong Island. The TD will closely monitor the passenger demand for external public transport services at Hung Hom Ferry Pier and review arrangements with the operators as appropriate.

  Regarding ancillary tourism facilities, Victoria Harbour is one of the most iconic attractions in Hong Kong. Currently, there are some commercially operated aquatic tourism offerings, with sightseeing vessels embarking and disembarking at various landing facilities along both sides of Victoria Harbour for visitors to tour around Victoria Harbour. Some sightseeing vessels even provide dining services, allowing visitors to savour delicacies while enjoying the stunning view of Victoria Harbour and experiencing the unique attractiveness of Hong Kong.

  The Tourism Commission and the Hong Kong Tourism Board will continue to leverage the waterfront promenades and water bodies to develop more mega events and travel experiences, and spare no effort in promoting and facilitating the staging of various tourism mega events and activities along both sides of Victoria Harbour.

(4) Currently, the land uses of the upper deck of Hung Hom Ferry Pier allow the purposes of shops and services. The TD is in active discussions with ferry operators to assist them in opening the upper deck of Hung Hom Ferry Pier for purposes such as commercial, retail or event, etc.

  For the upper deck of Hung Hom (South) Ferry Pier, the ferry operator has identified potential tenants interested in subletting the area for retail and services purposes and is anticipated to submit an application to the Government shortly.

  For the upper deck of Hung Hom (North) Ferry Pier, the ferry operator plans to convert the area for exhibition hall, retail and services purposes, and has obtained conditional approval from the TPB. In this regard, the TD is actively co-ordinating with relevant Government departments and the ferry operator to study the installation of appropriate fire service systems at the pier. The technical study and design are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026, followed with an evaluation of matters such as the details and feasibility of the plan, etc.

  The TD will continue to maintain close communication with the ferry operators regarding the operation and development of Hung Hom Ferry Pier, including encouraging operators to continue utilise the pier to expand non-farebox revenue and consider introducing activities with educational and cultural value where appropriate."
立法會十九題：鼓勵人才留港發展的措施,2025-10-22 12:20,2025-10-22 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200268.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上陳振英議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，雖然香港在國際管理發展學院最新發布的《2025年世界人才排名》中躍升至全球第四位，但在鼓勵人才留港發展方面仍存在結構性短板，尤其香港的生活成本高昂，令其在「生活成本」指標上的表現不佳，在全球排名第66位，因此政府應推出相應的長遠措施吸引和留住人才。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）為降低住房成本壓力，政府會否考慮在北部都會區等新發展區域預留部分土地，參考外國經驗以build-to-rent模式（即專為出租而建造房屋的模式）興建人才公寓，為來港人才提供穩定而可負擔的住屋選擇，以增加他們長期定居香港的誘因，從而促進本地經濟發展；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（二）鑑於有意見指出，培養本地人才的多種語言能力對提升其國際競爭力至關重要，政府會否考慮設立外語獎學金計劃，資助計劃在港長遠發展的本地學生或青年到海外修讀語言課程，以培育具跨文化素養及專業外語水平的本地人才；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就議員的提問，經諮詢發展局及教育局後，現答覆如下：

（一）北部都會區（北都）是香港的戰略發展區域，面積和未來人口約佔香港的三分之一，當中的產業用地推動創新科技以至其他產業發展。在相關政策局的支持下，發展局已在北都一些新發展區（如新田科技城和流浮山一帶）的產業用地，預留規劃彈性容許興建人才公寓，以配合有關的產業發展。

（二）政府一直大力投資教育，為學生提供多元化的學習機會。學習外語有助學生認識多元文化，並藉此加強與世界不同地方的連繫，提高他們日後投身工作、進修或創業的競爭力。政府一直鼓勵院校為學生提供學習外語的機會，並透過學生交流計劃及體驗學習等不同途徑，讓學生接觸更多地方的文化，擴闊視野，抓緊香港的獨特優勢，為未來發展作更好準備。多年來，政府與語文教育及研究常務委員會、其他諮詢組織和持份者通力合作，通過運用語文基金資助並推行不同的措施，以培育香港人，特別是學生及就業人士，兩文三語的能力。政府會繼續致力培育精通兩文三語及其他語言的人才，惟現時未有計劃設立問題所建議的外語獎學金計劃。"
LCQ19: Measures to encourage talents to stay in Hong Kong for development,2025-10-22 12:20,2025-10-22 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200333.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  There are views that although Hong Kong has leapt to the fourth place globally in the latest World Talent Ranking 2025 published by the International Institute for Management Development, it still has structural shortcomings in encouraging talent to stay and develop in Hong Kong. In particular, Hong Kong's high cost of living has resulted in poor performance in the ""cost of living"" indicator, with the city ranking 66th globally. Therefore, the Government should introduce corresponding long-term measures to attract and retain talent. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) in order to alleviate housing cost pressures, whether the Government will consider reserving land in new development areas such as the Northern Metropolis and, by drawing on overseas experience, constructing residential apartments for talent under the ""build-‍to-‍rent"" model (i.e. a model where housing is specifically constructed for rental purposes) to provide stable and affordable housing options for incoming talent, so as to increase the incentive for their long-term settlement in Hong Kong, thereby promoting local economic development; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(2) as there are views pointing out that cultivating multilingual abilities is crucial to enhancing the international competitiveness of local talent, whether the Government will consider establishing a Foreign Language Scholarship Scheme to subsidise local students or young people planning for long-term development in Hong Kong to attend language courses overseas, so as to nurture local talent with cross-cultural literacy and professional foreign language proficiency; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Our reply to the Member's questions, in consultation with the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Education Bureau, is as follows:

(1) The Northern Metropolis (NM) is a strategic development area in Hong Kong. With an area and planned population accounting for around one-third of Hong Kong's totals, the land for different industries in the NM would drive the development of innovation and technology and other industries. With the support of relevant policy bureaux, the DEVB has allowed planning flexibility for the construction of talent accommodation on industry land in some New Development Areas (such as San Tin Technopole and the Lau Fau Shan area) in the NM, with a view to supporting the relevant industry development.

(2) The Government has been making significant investment in educationto provide diversified learning opportunities for students. Learning foreign languages can help students understand multiculturalism and strengthen their connections with different parts of the world, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in pursuing employment or further studies, or starting their own businesses in the future. The Government has consistently encouraged schools and institutions to provide students with opportunities to learn foreign languages, and enable students, through various avenues such as student exchange programmes and experiential learning activities, to gain exposure to the cultures of more places, broaden their horizons, seize Hong Kong's unique advantages, and be better prepared for their future development. Over the years, the Government has been collaborating with the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research, other advisory bodies and stakeholders to enable Hong Kong people, particularly students and working adults, to become biliterate and trilingual, through sponsoring and implementing various measures using the Language Fund.The Government will continue to strive to nurture talents who are biliterate and trilingual, and proficient in other languages. However, there is currently no plan to introduce the Foreign Language Scholarship Scheme as proposed in the question."

​立法會十七題：打擊非法取酬載客活動,2025-10-22 11:55,2025-10-22 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200223.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上李鎮強議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

據報截至今年九月下旬，警方對駕駛未領有出租汽車許可證非法取酬載客的車輛（俗稱白牌車），已進行95次執法行動。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述95次執法行動中，（i）有多少名人士被法庭定罪，以及有關的判罰分別為何（包括罰款金額及涉案司機有否被罰停牌），以及（ii）有多少部涉案車輛被扣押，以及其扣押時間分別為何；

（二）律政司有否就一些被認為判罰較輕的上述案件申請上訴；如有，上訴的案件數目及結果為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）自二○二三年十二月生效的《2023年道路交通法例（提升個人化點對點交通服務）（修訂）條例》提高白牌車相關罪行的罰則後，政府有否統計及比較該條例生效前後法庭就該等罪行的判罰情況（以表列出）；及

（四）鑑於政府預期在《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》獲得通過後，首批持牌的網約車平台最快於二○二六年第四季內才開始營運，在尚未有持牌網約車平台的未來一年，執法部門有何計劃加強打擊白牌車？

答覆：

主席：

就李鎮強議員的問題各部分，經諮詢律政司、香港警務處及運輸署後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府決心打擊非法出租或取酬載客，以保障市民的安全和利益，近年更加強打擊力度。警務處持續在各區採取執法行動，在二○二五年（截至九月）已緝獲97宗個案，涉及在不同平台提供非法載客取酬服務的車輛，相比二○二四年全年的47宗已倍增。在上述個案中，有39宗案件已經由法庭定罪，涉及39名司機。另外七宗已進入司法程序，而其餘51宗案件正在調查中。

在上述被定罪的案件當中，涉案司機被判罰款1,200元至6,000元不等。而其中個別涉及違反逗留條件的司機，除了罰款之外，更加被判監禁兩星期至兩個月不等。另外，有24名司機被取消駕駛執照12至15個月不等。

根據《檢控守則》，律政司可基於判刑在法律上或原則上出錯，或判刑明顯過輕，向法庭申請覆核判刑。是否申請覆核判刑建基於每宗案件的事實和情況。律政司以往沒有就非法出租或取酬載客罪行的判刑向法庭申請覆核判刑。

根據現時《道路交通條例》（第374章）（《條例》），如有人就《條例》第52（3）條（即非法出租或取酬載客）的罪行被定罪，運輸署署長會根據《條例》暫時吊銷涉事車輛的車輛牌照，並指示車主把車輛移交署長保管（即提問所指的扣押），吊銷期為六個月（首次定罪）或12個月（再次定罪）。二○二五年被判定罪的個案中，有20輛車輛已被扣押或已排期扣押六個月，其餘案件正在處理中。

（三）為加強非法出租或取酬載客罪行罰則的阻嚇力，政府已於二○二三年十二月透過《2023年道路交通法例（提升個人化點對點交通服務）（修訂）條例》提高有關利用汽車作非法出租或取酬載客用途的罰則，包括提高最高罰款額和最高監禁期，以及延長暫時吊銷車輛牌照和扣押車輛的期限，詳情如下。

（四）政府將透過剛於十月十五日獲立法會通過的《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》（《條例草案》）進一步加強針對非法出租或取酬載客的罰則，訂明被定罪的司機須被取消駕駛執照至少12個月，並可長達三年；以及強化暫時吊銷相關車輛牌照及扣押車輛的安排，讓政府在未能識辨涉事司機以作出刑事檢控的情況下，仍然有機制可扣押涉案車輛，加強阻嚇力。

上述有關執法的新條文將配合《條例草案》其他部分的生效時間，在持牌網約車投入服務時生效，從而整體保障合法合規個人化點對點交通服務和乘客。

同時，政府會繼續加強執法工作，在各區打擊非法出租或取酬載客。運輸署亦會加強宣傳相關罰則，提醒司機切勿以身試法，以及提醒乘客使用非法出租汽車服務可能蒙受風險，因為當發生交通事故時，提供非法服務的車輛的第三者責任保險可能會失效。"
LCQ17: Combating activities of illegal carriage of passengers for reward,2025-10-22 11:55,2025-10-22 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200224.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lee Chun-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

  It has been reported that as at late September this year, the Police have conducted 95 enforcement actions against vehicles without a valid hire car permit being used for illegal carriage of passengers for reward (commonly known as white licence cars). In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) among the aforesaid 95 enforcement actions, (i) of the number of persons convicted by the court and the respective penalties (including fine amounts and whether the drivers involved were suspended from driving), and (ii) the number of subject vehicles which were detained and their respective detention periods;

(2) whether the Department of Justice has lodged appeals against any of the aforesaid cases in which the penalties were considered relatively low; if so, of the number of such appeal cases and their outcomes; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether, following the increase in penalties for offences relating to white licence cars under the Road Traffic Legislation (Enhancing Personalized Point-to-point Transport Services) (Amendment) Ordinance 2023, which came into operation in December 2023, the Government has compiled statistics on and compared the penalties imposed by the court for such offences before and after the commencement of the Ordinance (set out in a table); and

(4) as the Government expects that, after the passage of the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025, the first batch of licensed ride-hailing platforms will only commence operation in the fourth quarter of 2026 at the earliest, of the plans of the law enforcement agencies to step up efforts to combat white licence cars in the coming year when licensed ride-hailing platforms are not yet available?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Department of Justice (DoJ), the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), a consolidated reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Lee Chun-keung is provided as follows:

(1) and (2) The Government is determined to combat illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward with a view to safeguarding the safety and interests of the public. To this end, enforcement efforts have been strengthened in recent years. The HKPF has continued to take enforcement actions in various districts, where 97 cases were detected in 2025 (by September), involving the provision of illegal services of carriage of passengers for reward by vehicles through different platforms, representing a doubling of the 47 cases detected in the whole year of 2024. Of the abovementioned cases, 39 cases involving 39 drivers have been convicted by the court. Seven cases have entered judicial proceedings, while the remaining 51 cases are under investigation.

  Of the convicted cases, fines ranging from $1,200 to $6,000 were imposed on the drivers involved. Individual drivers involved in breach of condition of stay were, in addition to fines, sentenced to imprisonment ranging from two weeks to two months. Moreover, 24 drivers have been disqualified from driving for 12 to 15 months.

  According to the Prosecution Code, the DoJ may apply to the court for the review of a sentence on the basis that it has proceeded on an error of law or of principle or that it is manifestly inadequate. Whether an application for the review of a sentence will be made is based upon the facts and circumstances of each and every case. The DoJ has not made any application to the court for a review of sentences in relation to the offences of illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward.

  Under the existing Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374) (the Ordinance), if a person is convicted of the offence under section 52(3) of the Ordinance (i.e. illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward), the Commissioner for Transport will, in accordance with the Ordinance, suspend the vehicle licence of the vehicle involved and instruct the vehicle owner to deliver the vehicle to the Commissioner's custody (i.e. detention as referred to in the question). The suspension period is either six months (for first conviction) or 12 months (for subsequent conviction). Of the convicted cases in 2025, 20 vehicles have been impounded or scheduled for impoundment for six months, while the remaining cases are under process.

(3) To enhance the deterrent effect of the penalties for the offences of illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward, the Government in December 2023 increased the penalties for offences relating to illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward by motor vehicles through the enactment of the Road Traffic Legislation (Enhancing Personalized Point-to-point Transport Services) (Amendment) Ordinance 2023. These included increasing the maximum fine and term of imprisonment, as well as lengthening the period of suspension of vehicle licences and impoundment of vehicles, with details as follows:

Table 1: Details of the legislative amendments made in December 2023



Penalty
Maximum penalty prior to the 2023 legislative amendments

Since the commencement of the legislative amendments on December 22, 2023, the average amount of fines imposed and the number of cases on which imprisonment was imposed for offences relating to illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward by motor vehicles have increased, with details as follows:

Table 2: Comparison of penalties imposed before and after the legislative amendments in December 2023



Penalty
Before the legislative amendments
			(during 2023)
After the legislative amendments
			(by September 2025)


Fine
Ranging from $1,000 to $5,000

Imprisonment
No cases on which imprisonment was imposed
Imprisonment was imposed on five cases, the average of which was six weeks*


Suspension of vehicle licences and impoundment of vehicles
Impoundment of vehicle for three months was imposed on
			29 cases
Impoundment of vehicle for six months was imposed on
			58 cases



* In addition to the contravention of section 52(3) of the Ordinance, the cases also involved a contravention of section 4 of the Motor Vehicles Insurance (Third Party Risks) Ordinance (Cap. 272) and section 41 of the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115).

(4) The Government will further strengthen the penalties against illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward through the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 (the Bill), which was just passed by the Legislative Council on October 15. The Bill specifies that convicted drivers should be disqualified from driving for not less than 12 months and not more than three years; and strengthens the arrangement for the suspension of vehicle licences and impoundment of vehicles, allowing a mechanism under which the Government may impound the vehicles involved even if the driver involved cannot be identified for the purpose of instituting criminal proceedings, thereby enhancing the deterrent effect.

  The aforementioned new provisions on enforcement will dovetail with the commencement date of other parts of the Bill and take effect when licensed ride-hailing vehicles commence service, so as to provide comprehensive protection for legally compliant point-to-point transport services and passengers.

  Meanwhile, the Government will continue to strengthen law enforcement across all districts to combat illegal carriage of passengers for hire or reward. The TD will also step up its publicity efforts in reminding drivers of the relevant penalties and the need to abide by the law, while alerting passengers to the potential risks of using illegal hire car services as the third party liability insurance for the vehicle providing illegal services may become invalid in the event of a traffic accident."
Acting SFST's speech at Opening Ceremony of Green Tech Summit 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-10-22 11:46,2025-10-22 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200293.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, at the Opening Ceremony of the Green Tech Summit 2025 today (October 22):

Helene (CEO & Co-Founder, GoImpact, Ms Helene Li), Clarence (Co-Founder, GoImpact, Mr Clarence T'ao), Andy (Co-Founder, GoImpact, Mr Andy Ann), Kevin (Chif Executive and Founder, Templaria and Advisory Board Member, GoImpact, Mr Kevin Angelini), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is my pleasure to address you at the Opening Ceremony of the Green Tech Summit 2025. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the organiser GoImpact and all participants, including esteemed partners such as the World Bank and the Climate Bonds Initiative, for your unwavering support in advancing green technology and sustainability. Your collective efforts are instrumental in driving our shared green finance and ESG (environmental, social and governance) ambitions, paving the way for a transformative journey towards a greener future.

 Hong Kong is steadfast in our commitment to sustainability, guided by the Central People's Government's 14th Five-Year Plan, which sets goals of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Aligned with this vision, Hong Kong has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. These targets are not mere aspirations but a call to action, compelling us to leverage our position as a global financial centre to pioneer and drive innovative financing solutions that bridge environmental goals with financial expertise.

 Based on market research it is estimated that annual climate investments would have to reach US$9 trillion by 2030 and US$10 trillion by 2050. This demonstrates the immense demand for green and sustainable finance. As the leading international financial centre in Asia, Hong Kong is also rising as an international green and sustainable finance centre, playing our part in mobilising capital for green investments. In 2024, the total green and sustainable debt, including both bonds and loans, issued in Hong Kong exceeded US$84 billion, among which the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to around US$43 billion, capturing around 45 per cent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018. Our financial prowess enables us to fund transformative projects that align with our carbon neutrality objectives.

 The Government is also leading by example in the development of the green bond market. Under the Government Sustainable Bond Programme, we have issued green bonds totalling about HK$240 billion equivalent since May 2019. Notable milestones include the world's largest retail green bond in 2022 and the largest ESG bond issuance in Asia in 2023. To further advance innovation, we introduced the world's first tokenised government green bond of its kind in February 2023 and the world's first multi-tranche digitally native green bonds in 2024. Using the capital raised from the issuances, so far we have supported 116 local green projects across six eligible categories to deliver transparent and measurable environmental benefits.

 Financing aside, Hong Kong is actively promoting green finance by developing policies and frameworks to support sustainable investments, including ESG-focused financial products. The Government and the financial sector are collaborating to position the city as a leading global hub for green finance, attracting international capital to fund environmentally friendly projects. Hong Kong's status as a strategic nexus for green finance in Asia is central to advancing global sustainability objectives. As of June this year, there are more than 204 ESG funds in Hong Kong authorised by the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong), with assets under management of around US$150 billion. This sizable market of ESG funds demonstrates Hong Kong's role as the gateway to sustainable finance in Asia, gathering capital to empower green transformation.

 Complementing these efforts and achievements, the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme, extended to 2027, has disbursed around HK$380 million to over 600 green and sustainable debt instruments issued in Hong Kong, with a total underlying debt issuance exceeding HK$1.3 trillion as of September this year. This scheme provides subsidy for eligible bond issuers and loan borrowers to cover part of their expenses on bond issuance and external review services, driving decarbonisation and reinforcing Hong Kong's leadership in transition financing.

 Technology application is another driving force for development, and Hong Kong is at the forefront of integrating financial technology with green finance. To accelerate the green transformation of our economy, we are expanding our green fintech ecosystem. In March 2024 and June 2025, the Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group launched the Prototype Hong Kong Green Fintech Map and the Hong Kong Green Fintech Map 2025, respectively. Developed in collaboration with stakeholders, these platforms provide comprehensive information on green fintech companies and services in Hong Kong, elevating their visibility and impact and promoting business collaboration.

 To further support green fintech development, we launched the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme in June last year. This scheme provides early-stage funding to technology companies and research institutes collaborating with local enterprises to develop innovative green fintech solutions. A total of 39 applicants, involving 60 projects, were approved, each receiving a grant of HK$150,000 to facilitate commercialisation and proof-of-concept completion.

 On the journey towards green transformation, it is also important to empower our small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In partnership with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, our Green and Sustainable Finance Cross-Agency Steering Group launched the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions calculation and estimation tools in February last year. These tools, freely accessible on the Steering Group's website, empower small and medium enterprises and financial institutions to manage their environmental footprint and enhance sustainability reporting. The Steering Group will continue to enhance these public utility tools, including the GHG emissions tools and the Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies and SMEs, to improve data availability throughout this year.

 Furthermore, we are also exploring real-world asset tokenisation for green finance development. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, in collaboration with the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), is studying the application of tokenisation technology in carbon trading. The HKEX is also deepening pilot co-operation with the Greater Bay Area carbon market to test cross-border trade settlement mechanisms and build a regional carbon market ecosystem. In collaboration with Mainland regulatory authorities, we are also studying issues surrounding the country's participation in the international carbon market, including the formulation of voluntary carbon credit standards and methods, as well as the registration, trading and settlement of carbon emission reduction.

 Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's leadership in green finance reflects our ability to unite vision, innovation, and collaboration. The Green Tech Summit 2025's focus on green technology mirrors our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge solutions for a sustainable future. From our ambitious carbon neutrality targets to our pioneering green financing and fintech innovations, every step we take builds a resilient and inclusive ecosystem. I urge you to join us in harnessing innovation to create a greener, more sustainable Hong Kong and beyond. Thank you."

LCQ14: Data reflecting Hong Kong's economic situation,2025-10-22 11:45,2025-10-22 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102100678.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Adrian Ho and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

 Regarding the data that reflects Hong Kong's economic situation, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the median monthly employment earnings of employed persons and the median monthly household income in Hong Kong, as well as the three industry sectors that recorded the highest growth rates in median monthly employment earnings, for the past four quarters (up to the last month); the number of those industry sectors in which the median monthly employment earnings of employed persons recorded an increase;

(2) given that the Government has raised the maximum value of properties chargeable to the $100 stamp duty to $4 million with effect from ‍February 26 this year, of the respective amounts of stamp duty revenue collected in respect of (i) property leases, (ii) agreements for sale and purchase, or (iii) transfers of residential and non-residential properties in the current financial year to date; the changes in such stamp duty revenues as compared with those of the same period last year;

(3) of the proportion of the financial services sector in the Gross Domestic Product and the stamp duty revenue related to stock transfers collected in the past two years; the change in such stamp duty revenue as compared with that of the same period last year;

(4) given that the Government has resumed the collection of hotel accommodation tax at a rate of 3 per cent on the accommodation charges with effect from January 1 this year, of the respective amounts of hotel accommodation tax collected by the Government each month up to the third quarter of this year; and

(5) of the amount of revenue received by the Government from business registration fees, and the number of applications for exemption from payment of business registration fee received since January this year?

Reply:

President,

 In response to the questions raised by the Hon Adrian Ho, after consulting the relevant government departments, my reply is as follows:

(1) The statistics on the median monthly employment earnings of employed persons and median monthly household income from Q3 2024 to Q2 2025 (excluding foreign domestic helpers) compiled based on the survey results of the General Household Survey of the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) are provided in Table 1. The statistics for Q3 2025 are still being compiled.

 The median monthly employment earnings of employed persons by industry of main employment (excluding foreign domestic helpers) during the same period are provided in Table 2. The three industries with the largest year-on-year increases in Q2 2025 were manufacturing sector (12.5 per cent); transportation, storage, postal and courier services, information and communications sector (7.3 per cent); as well as financing and insurance sector (5.3 per cent). The industries which recorded a year-on-year growth in median monthly employment earnings include the construction sector; import/export trade and wholesale sector; real estate and professional and business services sector; accommodation and food services sector; and public administration, social and personal services sector.

(2) From April to September 2025, the stamp duty collection from (i) lease, (ii) sale and purchase of properties and (iii) transfer of properties other than by way of sale and purchase and their comparison with the same period of last year is presented in the table below.

Sale and purchase of properties
9.2 billion
+7%


Transfer of properties other than
			by way of sale and purchase
54 million
-13%




(3) According to the statistics of the C&SD, the financial services sector took up about 22 per cent and 25 per cent of GDP in 2022 and 2023 respectively. The statistics for 2024 are still being compiled.

 The stamp duty collection from stock transactions in 2024-25 was $52 billion, representing an increase of about 43 per cent compared to last year. The stamp duty collection from stock transactions in the first two quarters of 2025-26 was about $44 billion, representing an increase of about 143 per cent comparing to the same period of last year.

(4) Under the Hotel Accommodation Tax Ordinance (Cap. 348), the hotel accommodation tax (HAT) is levied quarterly and hotel and guesthouse proprietors are required to pay the HAT to the Government within 14 days after quarter-end. The HAT collected by the Government for the first and second quarters of 2025 amounted to about $190 million and $170 million respectively. The statistics for Q3 2025 are still being compiled.

(5) From January to September 2025, the business registration fee collected was about $2.6 billion, while the number of applications for exemption from payment of business registration fee and levy received was around 21 000 in the same period.

Notes:
Both median monthly employment earnings and median monthly household incomes are rounded to the nearest hundred.

(1) Monthly employment earnings refer to earnings (before deduction of Mandatory Provident Fund contributions) from all jobs during the month before enumeration. For employees, they include wage and salary, bonus, commission, tips, housing allowance, overtime allowance, attendance allowance and other cash allowances. However, back pays are excluded. For employers and self-employed, they refer to amounts drawn from the self-owned enterprise for personal and household use. If information on the amounts drawn for personal and household use is not available, data on net earnings from business would be collected instead.

(2) Employed persons refer to those persons aged 15 and over who have been engaged in performing work for pay or profit during the seven days before enumeration or who have had formal job attachment. Unpaid family workers and employed persons who were on leave/holiday during the seven days before enumeration are included.

(3) Monthly household income refers to the total cash income, including earnings (before deduction of Mandatory Provident Fund contributions) from all jobs and other cash income received in the month before enumeration by all members of the household. Other cash income includes income generated from rent income, interest, dividends, regular/monthly pensions and insurance annuity benefits, regular contribution from persons outside the household, regular contribution from charities and all government subsidies.

(4) Domestic household consists of persons who live together and make common provision for essentials for living. These persons need not be related. If a person makes provision for essentials for living without sharing with other persons, he/she is also regarded as a household. In this case, the household is a one-person household. A domestic household must have at least one member who is a Usual Resident. Households comprising Mobile Residents only are not classified as domestic households.

答覆：

主席：

為應對人力短缺帶來的挑戰，政府在保障本地工人優先就業的前提下，適度容許僱主確實未能在本地聘得合適人手時申請輸入勞工，推動香港的經濟發展。除為建造業、運輸業，以及安老院和殘疾人士院舍推出行業輸入勞工計劃外，勞工處自二○二三年九月四日起推行「補充勞工優化計劃」（優化計劃），暫停執行原有「補充勞工計劃」下26個職位類別及非技術或低技術職位一般不得輸入勞工的規定，以補充維持經濟動力所必須的勞動力。

就議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）自推行以來截至二○二五年九月，優化計劃共接獲7 932宗來自餐飲服務業及223宗來自住宿服務業的申請，分別涉及申請輸入60 449名和2 982名勞工；其間獲批的餐飲服務業和住宿服務業申請分別為5 188宗和167宗，獲批輸入勞工人數分別為35 589名和2 102名。上述兩個行業的申請和獲批輸入勞工人數按工種劃分的分項數字載於附件1。

​同期，有10宗餐飲服務業的申請被拒絕，涉及44名輸入勞工，被拒絕申請涉及的輸入勞工人數按工種劃分的分項數字載於附件2。申請被拒絕的主要原因包括未能符合全職本地僱員與輸入勞工的二比一人手比例（人手比例）規定或僱主有不良紀錄。同期沒有住宿服務業的申請被拒絕。

截至二○二五年八月，經「補充勞工計劃」／優化計劃仍在港工作的餐飲服務業和住宿服務業輸入勞工人數分別為16 622名及547名。勞工處沒有備存仍在港從事餐飲服務業和住宿服務業工作輸入勞工人數按工種劃分的分項數字。

（二）截至二○二五年九月，勞工處在僱主進行優化計劃下本地招聘期間，分別就餐飲服務業及住宿服務業作出1 257宗及441宗就業轉介，有107名及33名求職者獲僱主提出聘用。就業轉介按工種劃分的分項數字載於附件3。

（三）為保障本地工人的就業機會，獲批准輸入勞工的僱主必須與輸入勞工簽訂標準僱傭合約（標準合約），並支付不低於相類職位中位工資的薪金。輸入勞工只可擔任標準合約指定的職位及職務，並在指定的地點工作，不可轉換職位或職務範圍。勞工處已在優化計劃專題網頁新增網上投訴表格，方便本地僱員及輸入勞工就僱主涉嫌違反優化計劃的規定作出投訴。此外，勞工處的勞工督察不時巡查輸入勞工的工作地點，查核僱主有否遵守優化計劃的規定。僱主如違反有關規定，勞工處會對有關僱主作出行政制裁，包括撤銷僱主已獲得的輸入勞工批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

（四）及（五）為加強保障本地工人優先就業，勞工處自二○二五年六月起實施新措施，包括進行特別巡查行動，到聘用輸入勞工的企業查核僱主有否持續符合人手比例的規定；及按違規風險要求僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例。勞工處在特別巡查行動中共進行324次巡查，當中大部分僱主符合人手比例的規定。勞工處現正就有初步資料顯示，僱主未能符合人手比例規定的個案作進一步調查。此外，勞工處已按違規風險要求超過150名餐飲服務業僱主申報全職本地僱員及輸入勞工的資料和相關人手比例，沒有發現違規個案。

（六）及（七）自優化計劃推行以來，勞工處於二○二三年（九月四日至十二月三十一日）、二○二四年及二○二五年（截至九月）分別接獲一宗、22宗及327宗涉及餐飲服務業僱主的投訴。此外，二○二三年九月四日至二○二四年十二月三十一日，勞工處沒有收到涉及住宿服務業的投訴；而二○二五年（截至九月）則收到三宗有關投訴。按主要投訴事項劃分的分項數字載於附件4。由於投訴人無須表明其身分，勞工處沒有備存按投訴人身分劃分的分項數字。

勞工處已就收到的投訴展開調查，包括到輸入勞工的工作地點進行巡查及搜證，獨立會見僱主及僱員並查核有關的僱傭紀錄。由於負責調查投訴的職員同時執行其他職務，涉及調查工作的人手未能分開計算。

上述涉及餐飲服務業及住宿服務業的投訴中，勞工處已完成調查所有於二○二三年和二○二四年接獲的個案。完成調查的61宗個案中，60宗沒有足夠證據確立僱主違反優化計劃的規定；其他投訴個案正在調查中。基於保密原則，勞工處不會透露個別投訴個案的資料。就一宗餐飲服務業的僱主以輸入勞工取代在職本地僱員的個案，勞工處於二○二五年八月二十九日公布，向該名僱主施加行政制裁，撤銷該僱主就優化計劃已獲發的輸入勞工原則性批准及拒絕處理其隨後兩年提交的輸入勞工申請。

此外，就上述投訴及針對個別僱主的違法行為，勞工處於二○二四‍年及二○二五年分別向一名及六名違反《僱員補償條例》、《入境條例》或優化計劃規定的餐飲服務業或住宿服務業僱主施加行政制裁，撤銷其已獲得的輸入勞工批准，或／及拒絕處理這些僱主在隨後提交的其他申請，禁制期長達兩年。違反法例的僱主被判罰款1,600元至24,000元。

（八）政府一直動態監察就業市場的情況，與持份者保持緊密溝通，並參考政府統計處定期發布各項有關本港僱員就業情況和收入概況的統計數據及相關統計分析，因應最新的勞動力市場情況靈活精準地調整優化計劃的實施安排，致力確保本地工人優先就業。

勞工及福利局剛展開人力推算的中期更新，會針對輸入勞工比例較高的行業優先進行數據分析，以期提早提供有關部分的分析結果，在檢討優化計劃時作參考及幫助政府做好中長期規劃。"

(2) as employers applying for importation of workers under the ESLS are required to undertake local public recruitment exercises and the Labour Department will identify local job-seekers for referrals to these employers for interviews, of the respective numbers of local job-seekers referred by the authorities in respect of the applications concerning the catering and hotel-related industries in each year since the implementation of the ESLS, and among them, the number of job-seekers who have successfully secured employment, and their respective percentages, with a breakdown by job category (e.g. ‍waiters/waitresses, junior cooks and cooks);

(3) as it is required under the ESLS that imported labour are only allowed to work in the positions and perform job duties as specified in a Standard Employment Contract, there are views relaying that some employers in the catering industry have failed to fulfil such requirement by hiring junior imported labour (e.g. junior cooks) at lower wages and requiring them to take up positions at higher levels (e.g. No. 1 Cooks) and perform advanced duties beyond their designated scope of duties, thus affecting employment opportunities for local workers, of the targeted measures put in place by the authorities to combat such non-compliant acts;

(4) as the authorities indicated in June this year that a special inspection campaign would be launched to verify whether employers under the ESLS were able to meet the manning ratio requirements of full-time local employees to imported labour of 2:1 on a continuous basis, of the respective numbers of inspections conducted for applications concerning the catering and hotel-related industries so far and the number of enterprises involved; whether cases have been found during inspections in which employers have failed to meet the relevant manning ratio requirements; if so, of the details (including the number of cases and names of employers);

(5) as the authorities indicated in June this year that it would require employers under the ESLS to report information on full-time local employees and imported labour as well as the relevant manning ratios based on a risk-based approach, of the respective numbers of employers in the catering and hotel-related industries who have been asked to report such information so far, and their percentages in the total numbers of employers in all those industries under the ESLS; whether it will consider requiring all employers of imported labour to report such information on a regular basis;

(6) of the respective numbers of complaints received by the Government from (i) local workers and (ii) imported labour in the catering and hotel-related industries about the alleged non-compliance with requirements under the ESLS and/or the labour legislation by employers in each year since implementation of the ESLS, with a breakdown by nature of complaints; of the manpower deployed by the authorities to investigate those cases;

(7) regarding the complaints mentioned in (6), of the number of cases in respect of which investigations have been completed, and among which, the number of cases confirmed or ruled by the court to be non-compliant with the requirements under the ESLS and/or the labour legislation, and the following information for each of such cases: (i) ‍dates of complaints, (ii) commencement and (iii) completion dates of investigation, (iv) names of employers and (v) the industries to which they belong, (vi) details of non-compliance and/or violations (e.g. the employers involved are confirmed to have dismissed local employees or reduced their working hours after hiring imported labour, and the number of local employees affected), (vii) details of the administrative sanctions imposed and/or prosecutions instituted by the authorities, and (viii) penalties imposed by the court (if ‍applicable); and

(8) as it has been reported that a significant number of the approved applications under the ESLS involve positions engaging in job categories concerning the catering and hotel-related industries (including waiters/waitresses, junior cooks, and cooks), whether the authorities will consider regularly collecting and compiling statistics on employment data (including unemployment rates and underemployment rates) for local workers engaged in those job categories, and gain an understanding of the changes in such data, so as to provide additional reference information when reviewing and adjusting the ESLS?

Reply:

President,

To cope with the challenges brought by manpower shortage and foster Hong Kong's economic development, the Government, on the premise of ensuring employment priority for local workers, suitably allows employers with genuine difficulty in recruiting suitable local workers to apply for importation of workers. Apart from launching sector-specific labour importation schemes for the construction sector, transport sector, and residential care homes for the elderly and residential care homes for persons with disabilities, the Labour Department (LD) has implemented the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) since September 4, 2023 to suspend the general exclusion of the 26 job categories as well as unskilled or low-skilled posts from labour importation under the previous Supplementary Labour Scheme (SLS) to supplement the labour force required for sustaining the economic momentum.

The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) Since its implementation and as at September 2025, the ESLS received a total of 7 932 applications from the food and beverage services industry and 223 applications from the accommodation services industry, involving 60 449 and 2 982 imported workers respectively. During the period, 5 188 and 167 applications from the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry were approved respectively. The numbers of imported workers approved were 35 589 and 2 102 respectively. A breakdown of the number of imported workers applied for and approved by job title for the two aforesaid industries is at Annex 1.

During the same period, 10 applications from the food and beverage services industry were rejected, involving 44 imported workers. A breakdown of the number of imported workers involved in the rejected applications by job title is at Annex 2. Applications were rejected mainly because employers had failed to meet the manning ratio requirement of full-time local employees to imported workers of 2:1 (manning ratio) or had adverse records. No application from the accommodation services industry was rejected during the same period.

As at August 2025, there were respectively 16 622 and 547 imported workers working in the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry in Hong Kong under the SLS/ESLS. The LD does not maintain a breakdown of the number of imported workers working in the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry in Hong Kong by job title.

(2) As at September 2025, the LD made 1 257 and 441 job referrals under the ESLS for the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry respectively during the local recruitment exercises conducted by employers.107 and 33 job seekers respectively received employment offers from the employers. A breakdown of the number of job referrals by job title is at Annex 3.

(3) To safeguard the employment opportunities of local workers, employers approved to import workers must sign a Standard Employment Contract (SEC) with imported workers and shall pay a salary not lower than the median monthly wage of a comparable position. Imported workers shall only work in the positions and carry out job duties as specified in SEC, and at the designated workplace(s). Change in positions or job duties is not allowed. The LD launched an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers for suspected breaches of the requirements of the ESLS. In addition, Labour Inspectors of the LD conduct inspections of workplaces of imported workers from time to time to verify whether employers are complying with the ESLS requirements. If an employer has violated relevant requirements, the LD will impose administrative sanction on the employer, including withdrawal of approvals for importation of labour previously granted to the employer and refusal to process applications submitted in the following two years.

(4) and (5) To strengthen the protection of employment priority for local workers, the LD has implemented new measures since June 2025, including launching a special inspection campaign to check whether establishments employing imported workers had continuously met the manning ratio requirement, and requiring employers, based on a risk-based approach, to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratio. The LD conducted 324 inspections during the special inspection campaign, and the majority of the concerned employers complied with the manning ratio requirement. The LD is conducting further investigation into cases where preliminary information indicates that employers have failed to comply with the manning ratio requirement. Besides, the LD requested more than 150 employers in the food and beverage services industry to report information on full-time local employees and imported workers as well as the relevant manning ratio based on a risk-based approach. No violation was detected.

(6) and (7) Since the implementation of the ESLS, the LD received one, 22 and 327 complaints against employers in the food and beverage services industry in 2023 (from September 4 to December 31), 2024 and 2025 (as at September) respectively. Besides, from September 4, 2023 to December 31, 2024, the LD did not receive any complaint involving the accommodation services industry, while three relevant complaints were received in 2025 (as at September). A breakdown by major complaint items is at Annex 4. As complainants need not disclose their identity, the LD does not maintain a breakdown of the number of complaints by the identity of complainants.

The LD has launched investigation into all complaints received, including conducting inspections and gathering evidence at workplaces of imported workers, meeting with employers and employees individually and verifying relevant employment records. As the staff responsible for investigating complaints also undertake other duties, the manpower involved in investigation work cannot be separately identified.

Of the above complaints involving the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry, the LD completed investigations of all complaints received in 2023 and 2024. Among the 61 cases of which investigations were completed, there was insufficient evidence to establish employers' violation of the ESLS requirements in 60 cases, while the other cases are still under investigation. For reason of confidentiality, the LD will not disclose information of individual complaints. For a case involving an employer in the food and beverage services industry who displaced local employees with imported workers, the LD announced on August 29, 2025 the imposition of administrative sanction on the employer, withdrawing the approvals-in-principle for importation of labour previously granted and refusing to process applications submitted by the employer in the following two years.

In addition, regarding the aforementioned complaints and legal non-compliances of individual employers, the LD respectively imposed administrative sanctions in 2024 and 2025 on one and six employers of the food and beverage services industry, and the accommodation services industry who had violated the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, the Immigration Ordinance or the requirements of the ESLS. The LD withdrew their approvals for importation of labour previously granted, and/or refused to process their subsequent applications with a debarment period up to two years. The employers who violated the law were fined between $1,600 and $24,000.

(8) The Government has been dynamically monitoring changes in the employment market, maintaining close liaison with the stakeholders, and making reference to various statistical data and relevant statistical analyses on employment and income of local employees regularly published by the Census and Statistics Department. In response to the latest labour market situation, the Government adopts a flexible and targeted approach to adjust the implementation arrangements of the ESLS with a view to ensuring employment priority for local workers.

The Labour and Welfare Bureau has just commenced the mid-term update of the Manpower Projection and will accord priority to data analysis for industries with a higher proportion of imported labour, with a view to providing the relevant part of analytical results in advance for reference in reviewing the ESLS and supporting the Government's medium- to long-term planning."

立法會七題：防止僱員工作過勞,2025-10-22 11:24,2025-10-22 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200243.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上林振昇議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的書面答覆：

問題：

關於防止僱員工作過勞，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有意見指出，目前政府沒有就「工作過勞」制訂定義，若有僱員懷疑因工作過勞而猝死，往往被歸類為「在工作期間非因意外或職業病死亡」情況，過去十年每年及本年至今，勞工處錄得該情況的個案數目為何，並按死者（a）性別、（b）年齡、（c）所屬行業、（d）職業、（e）去世前六個月獲連續受聘期間（即連續兩個月或以上）的平均每月最高工時（以（i）256小時以下、（ii）256至279小時、（iii）280至299小時、（iv）300至319小時、（v）320至339小時及（vi）340小時或以上劃分）、（f）去世前一個月的總工時（以（i）276小時或以下、（ii）277至299小時、（iii）300至319小時、（iv）320至339小時及（v）340小時或上劃分），以及（g）死因（例如心臟疾病和腦疾病）列出分項數字及其所佔百分比；

（二）就第（一）項所述的個案，當局曾協助或跟進多少宗已故僱員家屬向有關僱主提出的申索個案；至今已完成處理的個案數目為何，並按申索情況（包括已故僱員家屬（i）放棄追討、（ii）已與僱主達成和解協議及（iii）已入稟法院向僱主提出申索）列出分項數字及有關百分比；該等申索涉及的平均款額，以及獲判勝訴及敗訴的宗數分別為何；獲判勝訴個案裁定的平均補償款額為何；

（三）鑑於政府於二○一六年十一月三十日回覆本會議員質詢時表示，根據《職業安全及健康條例》（第509章），僱主必須在合理及可行範圍內，確保僱員的工作安全及健康，包括確保其僱員得到適當的休息，當局根據甚麼準則判斷僱員是否得到適當休息；有否發現第（一）項所述個案涉及的僱主違反第509章的相關規定；如有，詳情為何，包括提出檢控及被定罪個案數目，以及被定罪個案的平均判罰；

（四）鑑於有研究顯示，保安員和建造業員工在工作期間因心腦血管病死亡的個案甚多，勞工處與職業安全健康局遂於二○二二年開展為期三年的「護心計劃」，為建造業和物業管理業機構的員工提供到會式健康風險評估等服務，讓該等行業前線員工及早認識心腦血管病的相關風險，該計劃的參與機構及受惠工友數目為何，並按行業（即建造業和物業管理業）列出分項數字；

（五）鑑於政府於二○一八年時決定會透過勞工處的行業性三方小組為11個行業編製行業性工時指引，以列明建議的工時安排及超時工作補償安排供僱主參考及採用，有關制訂指引工作的最新進展為何；及

（六）會否考慮參考鄰近地區的做法，為工作過勞制訂定義，並規定若有僱員在符合該定義的情況下受傷或死亡，其僱主須履行相關法定補償責任，以為工友或其家屬提供更大保障；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就林振昇議員的提問，現答覆如下：

（一）在過去十年，勞工處每年接獲涉及僱員在工作期間非因意外或職業病死亡的個案介乎98宗至182宗。根據勞工處有關職業傷亡致命個案的統計資料，於工作期間因心臟及腦血管疾病（心腦血管病）病發而死亡的個案，佔工作間非因意外死亡個案的絕大多數。有關個案按性別、年齡、所屬行業、職業／工作性質及死因劃分的分項數字及其所佔百分比詳列於附件一。勞工處沒有備存有關個案去世前一個月的總工時或去世前連續兩個月或以上內平均每月最高工時。

（二）就第（一）項所述的1 439宗個案，截至二○二五年九月，勞工處已完成處理1 397宗個案，正跟進餘下的42宗個案。已完成處理的個案每宗平均申索款額約為$890,000，其中經勞工處處理後獲僱主賠償的個案有五宗，家屬沒有繼續追討或家屬與僱主直接達成和解協議等的個案有1 374宗，其餘18宗個案的家屬已入稟法院向僱主提出申索。就家屬已入稟法院提出申索的個案，勞工處得悉法院已審結17宗，皆為在法院達成和解協議。

（三）根據《職業安全及健康條例》（《條例》）第6條的一般責任條款，僱主須在合理地切實可行範圍內，確保其僱員在工作中的安全及健康，包括為他們提供或維持屬安全和不會危害健康的工作系統，而休息時段是讓僱員恢復精神及體力的重要一環。勞工處人員根據《條例》巡查不同的工作地點時，會考慮個別工作地點的環境、工作性質及僱員的個人因素等情況，評估僱主有否提供或維持屬安全和不會危害健康的工作系統，而非只單獨考慮休息安排。若巡查發現有不足之處，視乎情況的嚴重性和所得證據，會按法例作出相應的執法行動。勞工處沒有備存與休息安排相關的檢控數字。

另外，勞工處已發出《休息時段指引》，鼓勵不同行業的持份者因應其行業情況，以風險為本及共同協商的原則，制定合理可行及勞資雙方同意的休息時段和安排。

（四）勞工處自二○二二年起聯同職業安全健康局推行「護心計劃」，鼓勵物業管理業和建造業的僱員建立健康生活習慣，預防心腦血管疾病。截至二○二五年九月三十日，共有1 991機構（包括522建造業機構及1 469物業管理機構）參加「護心計劃」並簽署「護心約章」，涵蓋僱員人數超過34萬，當中包括近10萬建造業僱員及超過24萬物業管理業僱員。

（五）勞工處致力在各行業性三方小組與僱主組織及勞工團體等商議擬定行業性工時指引。與會者坦誠分享各行業的工時安排及相關措施，但就擬定工時指引的方向及內容，包括應否及如何擬定每周或每天的標準工時，以及超時工作的工資補償比率等，勞資雙方仍未能達成共識。勞工處會參考三方小組的討論，加強宣傳及推廣良好工時管理措施，鼓勵僱主與僱員擬定合適的工時安排，促進僱員的工作與生活平衡。三方小組亦會繼續討論與工時有關的議題。

（六）「工作過勞」並非一個醫學診斷。根據勞工處所掌握的資料，國際勞工組織並沒有就「工作過勞」而導致工作間死亡制訂定義或指引，國際上亦缺乏公認的準則；而絕大部分國家或地方並沒有循僱員補償角度制訂相關定義。

香港現行的《僱員補償條例》已訂明，即使僱員所患疾病並非指明的職業病，但經證明是僱員在受僱工作期間因工遭遇意外所致的身體受傷或死亡，僱員或其家屬仍可根據條例就有關疾病向僱主追討補償。"
LCQ7: Prevention of employee overexertion at work,2025-10-22 11:24,2025-10-22 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200245.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Lam Chun-sing and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (October 22):

Question:

 Regarding the prevention of employee overexertion at work, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as there are views pointing out that at present, the Government has not drawn up any definition for ""overexertion at work"", and when an employee is suspected to have died suddenly due to overexertion at work, such cases are often classified as ""fatalities at work not caused by accidents or occupational diseases"", of the number of such cases recorded by the Labour Department (LD) in each of the past 10 ‍years and this year to date, with a breakdown by the deceased's (a) sex, (b) age, (c) industry, (d) occupation, (e) average maximum working hours per month during any period of continuous employment (i.e. two or more consecutive months) in the six months prior to death (set out by (i) less than 256 hours, (ii) 256 to 279 hours, (iii) 280 to 299 hours, (iv) 300 to 319 hours, (v) 320 to 339 hours and (vi) 340 hours or more), (f) total working hours in the month prior to death (set out by (i) 276 hours or less, (ii) 277 to 299 hours, (iii) ‍300 ‍to 319 hours, (iv) 320 to 339 hours and (v) 340 hours or more), and (g) cause of death (e.g. heart disease and brain disease), together with their respective percentages;

(2) in respect of the cases mentioned in (1), of the number of those in which the authorities have provided assistance to or conducted follow-up actions for claims lodged by the families of deceased employees against the relevant employers; the up-to-date number of cases in which the handling has been completed, with a breakdown by claim status (including deceased employees' families who have (i) withdrawn their claims for compensation, (ii) reached settlement agreements with the employers, and (iii) filed their claims in court against the employers), together with their respective percentages; the average amount of compensation involved in these claims and the respective numbers of successful and unsuccessful claims; the average amount of compensation awarded in successful cases;

(3) given that in its reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on November 30, 2016, the Government indicated that under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (Cap. 509), employers must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure the safety and health at work of their employees, which includes ensuring that their employees are given appropriate rest breaks, of the criteria on which the authorities base their determination as to whether an employee has been given appropriate rest breaks; whether any of the employers involved in the cases mentioned in (1) have been found to have contravened the relevant requirements under Cap. 509; if so, of the details, including the number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted and the number of convicted cases, and the average penalties imposed in convicted cases;

(4) given that some studies have shown a high incidence of fatalities during work relating to cerebro-cardiovascular diseases among security guards and construction workers, the Labour Department and the Occupational Safety and Health Council launched a three-year Heart Caring Campaign in June 2022 to provide on-site health risk assessments and related services to employees in the construction and property management industries, so as to enable frontline workers in these industries to identify risks associated with cerebro-cardiovascular diseases at an early stage, of the numbers of participating organisations and beneficiary workers under the Campaign, with a breakdown by industry (i.e. construction and property management industries);

(5) given that in 2018, the Government decided to draw up sector-specific working hours guidelines for 11 sectors through the industry-based tripartite committees of the LD, setting out suggested working hours arrangements and overtime compensation arrangements for employers' reference and adoption, of the latest progress in the development of these guidelines; and

(6) whether it will consider, with reference to the practices of neighbouring regions, drawing up a definition for overexertion at work and requiring employers to fulfil relevant statutory compensation obligations where an employee is injured or dies under circumstances falling within such definition, so as to provide greater protection for workers or their family members; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The reply to the Hon Lam Chun-sing's question is as follows:

(1) Over the past 10 years, the number of cases of fatalities at work received by the Labour Department (LD) each year that were not caused by work accidents or occupational diseases ranged from 98 to 182. According to the LD's statistics on occupational fatalities, cases died of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs) during work accounted for the vast majority of fatalities at work which are not caused by accidents. A breakdown of these cases by sex, age, industry, occupation or work nature, and cause of death, together with their respective percentages is provided in Annex I. The LD does not keep statistics of such cases by the total working hours of the cases in the month prior to their death, or the average maximum monthly working hours for two or more consecutive months prior to their death.

(2) As at September 2025, the LD had concluded the processing of 1397 cases of the 1439 cases mentioned in Part (1) and was following up on the remaining 42 cases. The average claim amount of each concluded case was around $890,000. Among the concluded cases, five received compensation from employers after LD's processing, and 1374 cases were not pursued by family members (FMs) or FMs had reached direct settlements with the employers, etc. FMs of the remaining 18 cases had lodged their claims at court. Among these 18 cases, the LD noted that 17 cases had been concluded, all with settlements reached at court.

(3) According to the general duty provisions under section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance (OSHO), every employer must, so far as reasonably practicable, ensure the safety and health at work of all his/her employees. This includes providing or maintaining systems of work that are safe and without risks to health, and rest breaks are essential for restoring employees' mental and physical strength. When conducting inspections at various workplaces in accordance with the OSHO, LD officers will assess whether the employer has provided or maintained a system of work which is safe and without risks to health by considering the environment of the individual workplace, the nature of the work, and the employees' personal factors, etc, rather than just considering rest arrangement alone. If deficiencies are found during the inspections, corresponding enforcement actions will be taken according to the law, depending on the seriousness of the case and the evidence collected. The LD does not keep prosecution figures related to rest arrangements.

 In addition, the LD has issued the Guide on Rest Breaks to encourage stakeholders of different industries, through a risk-based and consultative approach and having regard to their own circumstances, to work out reasonable and practicable rest break arrangements that are mutually agreed by employees and employers.

(4) Since 2022, the LD and the Occupational Safety and Health Council have jointly launched the Heart Caring Campaign to encourage employees in the property management and construction industries to develop healthy lifestyle to prevent CCVDs. As at September 30, 2025, 1 991 organisations (including 522 organisations in the construction industry and 1 469 organisations in the property management industry) have participated in the Campaign and signed the Heart Caring Charter, covering more than 340 000 employees, including nearly 100 000 employees in the construction industry and more than 240 000 employees in the property management industry.

(5) The LD has endeavoured to discuss with employer associations, labour organisations, etc, the formulation of sector-specific working hours guidelines through industry-based tripartite committees. While the participants candidly shared working hours arrangements and related measures in various sectors, the employers and employees have yet to reach a consensus on the direction and content of the proposed guidelines, including whether and how to establish weekly or daily working hours standards as well as the rates of compensation for overtime work. The LD will make reference to the discussions of tripartite committees to enhance the publicity and promotion of good working hours management practices, encourage employers and employees to formulate appropriate working hours arrangements thereby fostering employees' work-life balance. The tripartite committees will continue deliberating on issues relevant working hours.

(6) ""Overexertion at work"" is not a medical diagnosis. According to the information available to the LD, the International Labour Organization has not drawn up any definition or guidelines on workplace deaths caused by ""overexertion at work"", and there is also lack of internationally recognised criteria. Most countries or places do not have related definitions made in the context of employees' compensation.

 The existing Employees' Compensation Ordinance (ECO) of Hong Kong has stipulated that even if the disease suffered by an employee is not a specified occupational disease, the employee or his/her FMs may still claim compensation from the employer in respect of the disease in accordance with the ECO if the disease is substantiated to be a personal injury or death by accident arising out of and in the course of employment."
立法會十三題：提升旅客的通關體驗,2025-10-22 11:00,2025-10-22 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200252.htm,"以下是今日（十月二十二日）在立法會會議上陳克勤議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉內地與香港一直致力提升旅客的通關體驗。然而，有市民反映，由於跨境人流眾多，部分陸路口岸在臨近關閉時仍有不少旅客排隊等候辦理過關手續。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有市民反映，在深宵時分大部分陸路口岸關閉後，24小時開放的落馬洲管制站經常出現大量旅客人流，當局有否考慮延長其他陸路口岸的運作時間；若有，調整各口岸運作時間的詳細計劃為何；若否，原因為何；

（二）現時各陸路口岸有否設立酌情延長通關時間機制，以應對口岸關閉前仍有大量旅客等候過關的情況；若有，過去三年啓動相關機制的次數為何；若否，原因為何，以及會否與內地商討相關應對機制；

（三）有否與內地部門制訂通報機制，以在口岸關閉前的一段時間（例如半小時），互相通報正辦理離境手續的旅客人數，以確保有足夠時間為該等旅客辦理入境手續；若有，過去三年啓動相關機制的次數為何；若否，原因為何，以及會否與內地商討設立有關機制；

（四）過去三年，（i）經內地陸路口岸離境抵港的旅客，因本港關口已關閉而須向入境事務處求助的個案數目，以及（ii）經本港各陸路管制站離境的旅客，因內地關口已關閉而須即時折返回港的個案數目分別為何；及

（五）過去三年，本港各陸路管制站在關閉前一小時的平均出入境人次，以及辦理出入境手續（包括使用自助出入境檢查系統（e-道）服務）的平均等候時間分別為何；上述時段的通關平均等候時間與其他時段有否出現顯著差距；若有，會否考慮根據有關數據與內地當局商討或研究延長通關時間？

答覆：

主席：

隨着粵港市民跨境往來越趨頻繁，民間交流亦越見緊密。面對持續增長的通關需求，香港特別行政區政府一直密切監察各邊境管制站的運作，並積極提升口岸通關能力，便利香港與內地居民雙向奔赴。

就陳克勤議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）陸路口岸的開放時間由深港兩地政府協商，並須獲得中央批准。

目前，落馬洲／皇崗口岸為深港之間唯一24小時提供旅檢服務的口岸。根據入境事務處（入境處）的數據，現時落馬洲／皇崗口岸的服務能夠應付旅客於深夜時段過關的需求，並達致入境處的服務承諾，即98%的香港居民能夠在15分鐘內辦妥出入境手續，及95%的訪客能夠在30分鐘內辦妥出入境手續。

兩地政府亦會因應節日的通關需求，協商特別通關安排，便利兩地人民往來。例如，於去年除夕夜把羅湖口岸的旅客清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉延長至翌日凌晨二時，以及把深圳灣口岸的旅客和客車清關服務由原來凌晨十二時關閉，改為通宵服務。

此外，因應節日或大型活動期間增加的跨境人流，口岸部門會預先評估跨境旅客流量並作出相應安排，包括於繁忙時間安排其他組別的人員到管制站工作以加強服務。運輸署會提前與港鐵、本地和跨境公共交通營辦商協調，按預測人流加密班次。口岸部門亦會與內地相關部門，透過已建立的各個陸路口岸熱線及即時通報機制緊密聯繫，於有需要時作出迅速應變，靈活調配管制站人手加開檢查櫃枱、通道及小車車道，並按實際需要將部分貨車車道用作小車車道，確保口岸運作暢順。

延長通關時間牽涉兩地口岸運作，須審慎考慮一籃子因素，包括實際需要、兩地資源的有效運用、人手安排及交通配套等。在現行落馬洲／皇崗口岸及港珠澳大橋香港口岸提供24小時旅客出入境清關服務基礎上，我們會繼續密切留意旅客通關需求，視乎實際需要適時與內地有關當局協商延長個別口岸的旅檢通關服務時間。

（二）至（四）深港兩地口岸部門就各個陸路口岸均已設立了即時通報機制，緊密聯絡，時刻監察陸路口岸的情況，確保通關及人流管理等工作暢順。

如上文所述，陸路口岸的開放時間須獲得中央批准。於兩地陸路管制站接近關閉時間，如仍有大量旅客排隊等候過關，兩地口岸部門會緊密對接，即時交換資訊，包括在管制站已完成辦理離境手續的旅客人數。入境處會彈性處理，在有需要時加開檢查櫃枱及通道，確保在管制站關閉前，為所有已在內地口岸完成辦理離境手續的旅客辦理入境手續，因而不會出現旅客在內地口岸完成離境手續後，因港方口岸已經關閉而未能辦理入境手續的情況。據我們了解，內地口岸部門的處理方式亦類同。

（五）一般而言，晚間時段並非陸路管制站的出入境高峰時段。然而，我們亦留意到，有不少旅客選擇在部分陸路管制站接近關閉前過關。如上文所述，口岸部門會靈活調配人手，加開檢查櫃枱及通道，確保在管制站關閉前，為所有已在內地口岸完成辦理離境手續的旅客辦理入境手續。

過去三年，入境處陸路邊境管制站皆達到入境處所定目標，即98%的香港居民能夠在15分鐘內辦妥出入境手續，及95%的訪客能夠在30分鐘內辦妥出入境手續。

口岸部門會繼續採取各項措施，包括靈活調配人手、優化工作流程、善用資訊科技等，提升口岸通關效率和便利化水平，應對不斷上升的通關需求。"

LCQ13: Enhancing boundary-crossing experience for travellers,2025-10-22 11:00,2025-10-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/22/P2025102200255.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hak-kan and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (Oct 22):

Question:

  It is learnt that the Mainland and Hong Kong have all along endeavoured to enhance the boundary-crossing experience for travellers. However, some members of the public have relayed that, due to the high volume of passengers crossing the border, quite a number of travellers still have to queue up to go through immigration clearance at some land boundary control points (BCPs) just before they close. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the public have relayed that the Lok Ma Chau Control Point, which is open 24 hours a day, often experiences heavy passenger flow after most land BCPs close late at night, whether the authorities have considered extending the operating hours of other land BCPs; if so, of the detailed plan for adjusting the operating hours of various land BCPs; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether there is currently any mechanism in place at various land BCPs for exercising discretion to extend the operating hours in order to cope with situations where a large number of travellers are waiting to cross the border before the BCPs close; if so, how many times has the relevant mechanism been activated in the past three years; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will discuss with the Mainland the relevant mechanism to address the situation;

(3) whether a notification mechanism had been formulated with the Mainland authorities to mutually notify each other of the number of travellers going through departure clearance at certain time periods (e.g. every half an hour) before the BCPs close to ensure that there is sufficient time for travellers for immigration clearance; if so, how many times has the relevant mechanism been activated in the past three years; if not, the reasons for that, and whether it will discuss setting up of such a mechanism with the Mainland;

(4) in the past three years, of (i) the number of cases in which inbound travellers arriving in Hong Kong via land BCPs in the Mainland had to seek assistance from the Immigration Department because the BCPs in Hong Kong were closed, and (ii) the number of cases in which outbound travellers via various land BCPs in Hong Kong had to turn back immediately because the BCPs in the Mainland were closed; and

(5) in the past three years, of the respective numbers of outbound and inbound passengers at various land BCPs in Hong Kong during the hour before their closure, as well as the average waiting time for immigration clearance (including the use of the automated clearance system (e-Channel) service); whether there is any significant difference in the average waiting time for immigration clearance between the aforementioned period and other periods; if so, whether it will, on the basis of the relevant data, consider discussing or studying with the Mainland authorities the extension of the clearance time?

Reply:

President,

  With the increasing cross-boundary passenger flows between Guangdong and Hong Kong, exchanges at the community level have also intensified. In view of the growing demand for clearance services, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been closely monitoring the operation of the boundary control points (BCPs) and proactively enhancing the clearance capacity to facilitate the two-way flow of people between Hong Kong and the Mainland.

  The reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hak-kan is as follows:

(1) The opening hours of land BCPs are determined through consultation between the HKSAR Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government, and are subject to the approval of the Central Authorities.

  At present, Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port is the only BCP between Shenzhen and Hong Kong providing round-the-clock passenger clearance services. According to the statistics of the Immigration Department (ImmD), the current service capacity of LMC/HG Port is able to meet the demand for cross-boundary travels during late-night hours, fulfilling the ImmD's performance pledge to clear 98 per cent of Hong Kong residents within a 15-minute waiting time and 95 per cent of visitors within a 30-minute waiting time.

  The governments of both sides would also make special arrangements to meet the demand for clearance services and facilitate cross-boundary passenger flows during festive periods. For instance, on New Year's Eve last year, the passenger clearance services at the Lo Wu Control Point, which usually close at midnight, were extended until 2am the following day, while the passenger and passenger vehicle clearance services at the Shenzhen Bay Control Point, which usually close at midnight, operated overnight.

  In addition, to cope with the increase in crossâboundary passenger flows during festive periods or largeâscale events, the departments at BCPs will pre-assess the cross-boundary passenger traffic and make corresponding arrangements, including arranging officers of other sections to work at BCPs during peak hours to enhance services. The Transport Department will also co-ordinate in advance with the MTR Corporation Limited, as well as local and cross-boundary public transport operators, to increase service frequency based on the estimated passenger traffic. Besides, the departments at BCPs have been maintaining close liaison with relevant Mainland authorities through the established port hotlines and real-time notification mechanisms for various land BCPs to take timely actions where necessary, including flexibly deploying manpower to operate additional clearance counters, channels and private car kiosks, and converting some of the goods vehicle kiosks into private car kiosks having regard to actual needs, to ensure smooth operations of BCPs.

  The extension of operating hours of clearance services involves the operation of the ports on both the Mainland and Hong Kong sides, and careful consideration has to be given to a host of factors, including the actual needs, effective utilisation of resources of both places, manpower arrangements and ancillary transport services. On the basis of the 24-hour passenger clearance services currently provided at the LMC/HG Port and the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port, we will continue to closely monitor the demand for passenger clearance services and, having regard to actual needs, liaise with relevant Mainland authorities on extending the operating hours of the passenger clearance services at respective BCPs when necessary.

(2) to (4) Relevant departments of Hong Kong and the Mainland at BCPs would maintain close liaison through the established real-time notification mechanisms to monitor the real-time situations at land BCPs and ensure smooth clearance and crowd management.

  As aforementioned, the opening hours of land BCPs are subject to the approval of the Central Authorities. In cases where BCPs of both places are nearing closing time and there are still a large number of passengers queuing up for clearance, relevant departments of both places will liaise closely and immediately exchange information, including the number of passengers who have completed departure clearance at BCPs. The ImmD would exercise flexibility and operate extra clearance counters and channels when necessary, with a view to ensuring the completion of arrival clearance for all inbound passengers who have completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports before the closure of BCPs. There will hence not be any instances where passengers, having completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports, are unable to complete arrival clearance due to the closure of BCPs in Hong Kong. We understand that the Mainland port authorities adopt a similar arrangement.

(5) Generally speaking, evening hours are not peak periods for boundary crossings at BCPs. However, it is observed that quite some passengers choose to cross the boundary shortly before the closing time of BCPs. As aforementioned, the departments at BCPs will flexibly deploy manpower and operate extra clearance counters and channels to ensure the completion of arrival clearance for all passengers who have completed departure clearance at the Mainland ports before the closure of BCPs.

  In the past three years, all land BCPs under the ImmD have met the ImmD's target to clear 98 per cent of Hong Kong residents within a 15-minute waiting time and 95 per cent of visitors within a 30-minute waiting time.

  The departments at BCPs will continue to take various measures, including flexible deployment of manpower, optimisation of workflow and effective use of information technology, so as to enhance the clearance efficiency and the level of clearance facilitation at BCPs to cope with the increasing demand for clearance services."
