SEE attends Hong Kong-Shenzhen Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection meeting (with photo) ,2025-11-04 23:10,2025-11-04 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400768.htm,"The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, today (November 4), led a delegation to Shenzhen to attend the second meeting in 2025 of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection.

The meeting reviewed the collaborative achievements of the Joint Working Group over the past year. Hong Kong and Shenzhen have strengthened the close collaboration of the Joint Working Group in the past year. Exchanges such as thematic discussions and exchange visits increased by more than half compared to the past. In-depth discussions covered topics including the water ecology of Shenzhen Bay, regional atmospheric environment, ecological conservation, and resources circulation, jointly building a beautiful bay area.

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been continuously promoting various measures to improve air quality. The overall air quality in Hong Kong has been improving in recent years, with concentrations of major air pollutants continuously decreasing and remaining at low levels since Hong Kong's return to the Motherland. Electric vehicles have become increasingly popular in Hong Kong, with the number increased to about nine times of that six years ago. Currently, about seven out of every 10 newly registered private cars are electric, and the growth rate is among the highest in the world. With the further development of green transport, Hong Kong's air quality will continue to improve.

On water quality of Shenzhen Bay, through the joint efforts of both sides, a long-term significant improvement trend has been observed since the mid-2000s, with total inorganic nitrogen levels dropping by over 50 per cent compared with the period around Hong Kong's return to the Motherland.

The progress of carbon inclusivity of both sides was also discussed at the meeting. The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) said that the Green$ Electronic Participation Incentive Scheme has over 1.1 million registered users, with an accumulative total of over 120000 tonnes of recyclables and food waste collected.

On ecological conservation, the HKSAR Government continues to strengthen the protection of the Wetland of International Importance in the Deep Bay area and is actively promoting the construction of the Sam Po Shue Wetland Conservation Park in the Northern Metropolis, actively supporting the development of the International Mangrove Center in Shenzhen at the same time. Hong Kong and Shenzhen will continue to exchange experiences on country parks management, public education, and relevant conservation efforts for species such as corals and butterflies, and promote hiking etiquette.

Representatives of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) shared at the meeting that through distributing promotional leaflets and engaging local and Chinese Mainland social media such as Xiaohongshu to promote safety tips on hiking to visitors and hikers, such as using designated trails, protecting the environment and ecology, avoiding disturbance or harm to wildlife, and ""Take Your Litter Home"".

Mr Tse expressed gratitude for the collaborative efforts of various departments of the Shenzhen Municipal Government. He hoped that both sides will continue the joint efforts under the framework of the Joint Working Group, striving to achieve the dual carbon goals in pollution management and waste management, as well as to have greater achievements in developing biodiversity, building beautiful bays, and expanding environmental technology co-operation and development under the Belt and Road Initiative, continuously achieving new progress and breakthroughs.

The Permanent Secretary for Environment and Ecology (Environment), Mr Eddie Cheung; the Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui; and representatives from the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the EPD and the AFCD also attended the meeting.

Mr Tse returned to Hong Kong this evening."

Update on chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-11-04 21:28,2025-11-04 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400648.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 4), the CHP has recorded one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF). The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
---------------------------

The case involves a 60-year-old female living in Tai Po District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she travelled to Cuba between October 11 and October 29. She developed join pain one day before returning to Hong Kong (October 28). She developed a fever on October 31 and sought medical attention at a private hospital on same day. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. She is now in stable condition and will be admitted to a public hospital for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. Her two household contacts and travel companions to Cuba are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

Since the patient stayed in Cuba during incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it will report the case to the relevant health authority.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 56 confirmed CF cases this year, including three local cases and the rest are imported cases. For the local case announced yesterday, the CHP is carrying out genome analysis for the 45-year-old male to ascertain whether it has epidemiological linkage with cases confirmed in Hong Kong earlier. Investigation is ongoing.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 259 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 26 to November 1), showing a decrease compared to the previous week (October 19 to 25), which reported 868 cases. The cases last week were mainly reported in Foshan (51 cases), Shenzhen (48 cases), Jiangmen (44 cases), Guangzhou (37 cases) and Zhuhai (18 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
--------------------------------------------------------------

In response to the new local case,the CHP urged the residents living nearby Mount Haven in Tsing Yi, Kwai Chung Plaza and Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately if they presented with a fever, rash or joint pain since October 1.

The CHP organised anonline live seminarat 8.30pm tonight. Doctors would explain the latest situation of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents. The CHP would also collaborate with Kwai Tsing District Office to organise health talks for the residents at the Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi at 3pm tomorrow (November 5), which aims to enhance public understanding of this mosquito-borne disease and encourage active participation in prevention efforts to protect both oneself and others.

The CHP officers and relevant District Services & Community Care Teams have distributed leaflets on prevention of CF to residents living in Mount Haven and nearby, and 7 500 units near Kwai Chung Plaza and Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wanto remind them to take note of relevant symptoms and be aware of environmental hygiene in the household.

In light of the three local cases, the CHP has set up health consultation booths at Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi, Kwai Fong Estate (near Kwai Ming House), pedestrian bridge towards the east exit of Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan and Fung Tak Shopping Centre in Wong Tai Sin to provide assessments to members of the public with relevant symptoms. Please visit the CHP's webpage for the venues and operation hours of the health consultation booths. The inquiry hotline (2125 2373) set up earlier will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 15 000 individuals working or residing at districts with higher risk, and 43 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests, details are as follows:





In the vicinity of Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin
In the vicinity of Mount Haven in Tsing Yi
In the vicinity of Kwai Chung Plaza
In the vicinity of Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan

The CHP has again issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant. If there is any suspected CF cases, they should contact the CHP for follow up immediately.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況（附圖）,2025-11-04 20:32,2025-11-04 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400603.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月四日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門採取適當防控措施，致力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名60歲女子，住所位於大埔區。初步調查顯示，她於十月十一日至二十九日到訪古巴。她於抵港前一天（十月二十八日）出現關節痛，於十月三十一日出現發燒，同日到私家醫院求醫。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定，正獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。病人的兩名家居接觸者及與她同行到古巴的人士，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪古巴，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並會把個案通報相關衞生部門。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得56宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，三宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。就昨日公布的一宗本地個案，中心正對該名45歲男子的病毒進行基因分析，以判斷是否與本地早前錄得的個案有流行病學關連。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（十月二十六日至十一月一日）廣東省新增259宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較對上一周（十月十九日至二十五日）的868宗顯著下降。上周個案主要分布在佛山市（51宗）、深圳市（48宗）、江門市（44宗）廣州市（37宗）及珠海市（18宗）。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就新增的一宗本地個案，中心呼籲青衣曉峰園、葵涌廣場及上環信德中心一帶居民，如於十月一日後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛症狀的人士，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。

今晚八時三十分，中心會舉行網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的病徵、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等。明日（十一月五日）下午三時，中心亦會和葵青民政事務處在青衣長亨社區會堂合辦教育講座，以期加深市民對這種蚊傳疾病的認識，一同參與防控工作，護己護人。

此外，中心人員和有關地區的關愛隊已向曉峰園和附近的居民、葵涌廣場及上環信德中心一帶超過7 500個單位派發有關預防基孔肯雅熱的單張，提醒居民留意有否相關病徵和注意家居的環境衞生。

就三宗本地個案，中心已在青衣長亨社區會堂、葵芳邨近葵明樓、上環信德中心東出口方向行人天橋和黃大仙鳳德商場設立醫護站，為出現相關症狀的市民作評估。醫護站地址和運作時間請參閱中心網站。而早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）會繼續每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。

截至今日下午五時，中心已為逾一萬五千名在較高風險地區工作或居住的市民進行評估，並為43名的出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，詳情如下：

中心亦已再次向醫生、醫院、學校及院舍發信，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺，如有懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱個案，立即通知中心跟進。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
為期兩日（十一月三日至四日）的主論壇匯聚環球政府官員、監管機構、金融科技創新者、企業創辦人、投資者及業界領袖，舉行了多場前瞻性的專題討論、主題演講和政策交流。今年是香港金融科技周和StartmeupHK創業節兩大旗艦盛事踏入十周年慶典，並首次聯合舉辦，兩項活動的結合不僅彰顯香港對數字經濟的堅定承諾，更進一步鞏固其作為領先國際金融中心及蓬勃發展的初創企業樞紐地位。

為期一周的慶典將持續至十一月七日，其間將在全港舉辦各項社區和合作夥伴活動。本年活動吸引來自超過100個經濟體，逾37 000與會者，約800名演講嘉賓、700多家參展機構及逾30個來自國際及中國內地的代表團參與。

慶祝十載創新與躍進

為期兩日的主論壇由財經事務及庫務局、商務及經濟發展局和投資推廣署（投資署）聯合主辦，並由香港金融管理局、證券及期貨事務監察委員會、保險業監管局和活動指定承辦商Finoverse合辦。

行政長官李家超為活動揭幕致辭時，強調香港作為創新與協作橋樑，會更好發揮其優勢。他表示：「香港心繫協作、力求創新，致力讓企業、創業家、投資者及專業人士發揮所長。」

他指出香港在今年聯合國貿易和發展會議發布的《世界投資報告》中，於外來直接投資流入方面總體排名上升至第三位。他亦指出香港在今年的首次公開招股集資額成績亮麗，反映香港作為世界領先上市及集資中心的地位煥發更大活力。」

李家超強調：「這些國際稱譽充分反映香港作為『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的地位。我們全力為國家與世界各地的市場搭建橋樑，並協助初創企業從地方的原形設計躍升為全球的成功典範。」

財政司司長陳茂波與投資推廣署署長劉凱旋、滙豐集團行政總裁艾橋智以及渣打集團行政總裁溫拓思一同參與專題討論。

陳茂波以闡述香港金融科技的戰略願景展開討論，指出數字化轉型具有巨大潛力，而香港監管機構在促成創新方面亦扮演重要角色。他表示：「十年來，香港金融科技周和StartmeupHK創業節這兩項活動彰顯了影響力、抱負和創意。它們匯聚了來自世界各地的企業家、全球投資者、政策制定者和業界先驅，他們都抱着共同信念：科技能讓金融更普惠、更高效和更貼近人性。」

展現無比韌性和發展蓬勃的初創生態圈

商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺在第二日的主題演講中強調，香港初創生態圈快速增長，初創企業數目在過去十年，大幅增加近三倍至去年約4 700間，按年增長10%。

丘應樺聚焦香港的初創生態系統──它不僅是金融創新的樞紐，更是所有創新領域突破的理想跳板，涵蓋教育科技、電子商貿、物流技術、機械人、數據分析、綠色科技等。他表示：「香港的創業精神、全球聯繫性和跨境協同效應，使我們成為創新理念成長和產業轉型的理想環境。」

丘應樺亦概述政府為支持初創企業持續增長而推出的措施，他表示：「在知識產權方面，我們將協助創新企業以知識產權進行融資，以提升知識產權貿易的生態圈，包括推出知識產權融資沙盒、為企業提供專利評估等。」

他補充：「政府同時推出其他支援措施，例如新修訂的《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》協議、全新的公司遷冊制度、各項中小企資助計劃，以及稅務優惠等。」

第二日的主論壇還見證了旗艦活動全球Fast Track計劃2025的總決賽。該計劃現已舉辦至第八屆，吸引全球70個經濟體超過700份報名，反應熱烈。參賽企業家在主論壇向投資者、監管機構和企業合作夥伴展示其創新方案。國際組別的冠軍由美國的 Speratum Biopharma Inc奪得，中國內地組別的冠軍則由FirstQuadrant奪得。

今年StartmeupHK創業節與香港金融科技周聯合舉行，打造更具規模的業界平台，聯繫企業家和投資者。來自亞洲、中國內地、歐洲及中東的初創企業透過路演環節、創投展示會和業界交流會，獲得行業專家的深度見解，與商業領袖和創新技術專家交流的絕佳機會。

全球領袖雲集香港

今年主論壇將設有11個主題論壇，內容經過精心策劃，涵蓋多個重點領域，包括人工智能與前沿科技論壇、數字金融論壇、健康科技論壇及全球創科‧智匯中國論壇。主要演講嘉賓包括科技和金融領域的領袖：

Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 main conference concludes on high note as citywide innovation events continue (with photos),2025-11-04 19:55,2025-11-04 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400427.htm,"The Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival (HKFW x SMUF) 2025 main conference concluded today (November 4) at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, setting the tone for a week-long celebration of innovation, entrepreneurship and financial technology across the city.

The two-day main conference ran November 3 and 4, and brought together government officials, regulators, fintech innovators, entrepreneurs, investors and industry leaders from around the world for a series of forward-looking panels, keynote speeches and policy discussions. This year marks the 10th anniversary of both Hong Kong FinTech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival, held together for the first time, a testament to Hong Kong's commitment to advancing the digital economy and strengthening its position as a global centre for fintech and start-up growth.

The week-long events will continue through to November 7, featuring a wide range of community and partner functions held citywide. The week is expected to welcome over 37 000 participants from over 100 economies to the city, including some 800 distinguished speakers, over 700 exhibitors and more than 30 Mainland and international delegations.

Celebrating a decade of innovation and scaling

The two-day main conference was organised by the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission and the Insurance Authority, with Finoverse as the appointed event organiser.

The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, officiated at the opening of the main conference, emphasising Hong Kong's strength as a bridge between innovation and collaboration in his speech. Mr Lee remarked, ""Hong Kong is made for collaboration and built for innovation - for companies, entrepreneurs, investors and professionals.""

Mr Lee said that in this year's World Investment Report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, Hong Kong moved up to third place overall in foreign direct investment inflows. He also highlighted Hong Kong's fundraising achievements at initial public offerings this year, which underlined the city's revitalised status as the world's premier listing and capital-raising venue.

  ""These and other international kudos reflect Hong Kong's status as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder'. We help to link the markets from China, our country, with those around the globe. We help start-ups go from local prototypes to global success,"" said Mr Lee.

The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, joined a panel discussion alongside the Director-General of Investment Promotion of InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau; Group Chief Executive of HSBC, Mr Georges Elhedery; and Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered, Mr Bill Winters.

Mr Chan opened the panel discussion by sharing insights on Hong Kong's strategic vision for financial innovation, emphasising the vast potential of digitalisation as well as the role of the city's regulators in enabling this. ""As we mark the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong FinTech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival, we're celebrating a decade of impact, ambition and bold ideas. These two signature events have brought together visionary entrepreneurs, global investors, policymakers, and industry pioneers from around the world - all united by a shared belief: that technology can make finance more inclusive, more efficient and more human"", he said.

Resilient and thriving start-up ecosystem

During his keynote on day two, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, highlighted the sheer pace of growth in Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem, which has over the past decade nearly tripled to 4 700 as of last year with a year-on-year increase of 10 per cent. 

Mr Yau zoomed in on Hong Kong's start-up ecosystem today, noting that it is not only a hub for financial innovation, but also a launch pad for breakthroughs of all innovation sectors, covering edutech, e-commerce, logistics technology, robotics, data analytics, greentech, etc. ""The city's entrepreneurial spirit, global connectivity and cross-border synergies make it a fertile ground for innovative ideas to grow and industries to transform,"" he said.

Mr Yau also outlined government measures to support the continued growth of start-ups. ""On intellectual property (IP), we will assist innovative companies in leveraging IPs for financing to enhance the IP trade ecosystem. This includes launching an IP financing sandbox pilot project, providing patent evaluation for companies, etc.

  ""There are also other supportive measures in place, such as the enhanced Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement agreement, the new company re-domiciliation regime, various SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) funding schemes, as well as tax concessions.""

The second day also witnessed the grand finale of the flagship Global Fast Track 2025 pitching competition. Now in its eighth edition, the competition attracted over 700 applicants from 70 economies, culminating in an in-person final pitch at the main conference where entrepreneurs presented their solutions to investors, regulators and corporate partners. United States-based Speratum Biopharma Inc was crowned the winner of the International Category, while First Quadrant was the winner of the Chinese Mainland Category.

The integration of the StartmeupHK Festival with Hong Kong FinTech Week this year created a single mega platform for entrepreneurs and investors to connect. Start-ups across Asia, the Chinese Mainland, Europe and the Middle East joined pitching sessions, venture showcases and ecosystem dialogues, enabling direct engagement with global venture capital and corporate innovation teams.

Global executives descend on Hong Kong

The main conference featured 11 themed forums, spanning topics from AI & Advanced Tech Forum, Digital Assets Forum,HealthTech Forum to China-Global Innovation Forum. Headline speakers spanned global leaders from technology to finance and beyond: 

The Group Chief Executive of Standard Chartered, Mr Bill Winters;
The Head of Technology and Innovation in Financial Services at the World Economic Forum, Ms Drew Propson;
The Chairman of Ant Group, Mr Eric Jing;

Filipino male jailed for conspiracy to defraud,2025-11-04 19:27,2025-11-04 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400546.htm,"  A Filipino male recognizance form holder, charged with 18 counts of conspiracy to defraud, pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment by the District Court today (November 4).

  During a previous investigation into a case relating to overstaying former foreign domestic helpers (FDHs) who were taking up unapproved employment in Hong Kong, the Anti-Illegal Migration Agency of the Immigration Department (ImmD) detected a syndicate using false instruments to apply for FDH working visas. Upon intelligence analysis, investigators identified the target person and mounted a series of operations from May to July 2023. During the operations, over 60 persons were arrested. Under caution, the Filipino male (defendant) admitted, for the purpose of receiving a monetary reward, to have conspired with others to obtain FDH visas to work in Hong Kong illegally through the use of false residential and financial proof, as well as false FDH contracts. The defendant, later charged with conspiracy to defraud, pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment by the District Court today.

  Twenty-six other arrested persons were also convicted earlier for offences such as conspiracy to defraud and making false representation to an immigration officer, and were sentenced to up to 15 months' imprisonment. More suspects could be arrested and prosecuted as the investigation is continuing.

  ""It is an offence to make a false representation to an immigration officer. Offenders are liable to prosecution and to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years. In addition, anyone who commits the offence of conspiracy to defraud is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. Furthermore, it is an offence to make, possess or use false instruments. Upon conviction, offenders are liable to a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

入境事務處（入境處）反偷渡情報局早前在調查一宗前外籍家庭傭工（外傭）逾期逗留在港非法工作的案件中，發現一個以虛假文書申請外傭工作簽證的犯罪集團。調查人員經情報分析後鎖定目標人士，並於二○二三年五月至七月展開一連串執法行動，拘捕超過六十名涉案人士。該名菲律賓籍男子（被告）在警誡下承認為賺取報酬，以偽造的住址和收入證明，以及虛假外傭合約，協助他人以不法手段取得外傭簽證，留港從事非法工作。被告因涉嫌串謀欺詐而被落案起訴，並於今日在區域法院承認有關控罪，被裁定罪名成立並判監禁三十六個月。

同案另外二十六名被捕人士在早前亦已就串謀欺詐及向入境處職員作出虛假申述等控罪被定罪，最高被判處監禁十五個月。調查行動目前仍然繼續進行，入境處不排除將有更多涉案人士被捕及被落案起訴。

入境處發言人稱：「任何人士向入境事務處職員作出虛假申述，即屬違法。違例者會被檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款港幣十五萬元及入獄十四年。而任何人被裁定觸犯串謀欺詐罪，最高可被判監禁十四年。此外，任何人士如製造、管有或使用虛假文書，一經定罪，最高可被判入獄十四年。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」"

記者：首先想問醫委會聆訊，有一個個案因為政府高度關注後，醫委會決定覆核。但亦有些統計顯示醫委會的投訴在過去五年，有超過六成的處理時間都不達標。除了這宗個案政府高度關注，介入後醫委會主動覆核，其他個案怎樣處理？

醫務衞生局局長：香港的醫療一直都是很高質素，亦很受市民尊重和信任。我想強調，醫患關係中互相信任是非常重要的。我們一直強調，香港的醫療在現有機制下是專業自主，我覺得更加重要的應該是要專業自律。我們有一個法定機構──醫務委員會（香港醫務委員會），當中除了專業的醫生外，亦有一些界別以外的人士，即是非醫療人員參與，務求做到公平、公正、公開。一直以來，我們都能夠維持香港非常高的醫療水平和質素，確保市民在使用醫療服務時得到保障。

確實，醫務委員會的工作越來越繁重，因爲隨着醫療服務的複雜性不斷上升，醫務委員會亦須要與時並進。我們曾經就與醫務委員會有關的《醫生註冊條例》作修訂，不過隨着工作量增加，確實有一些個案的處理時間比較長。我看問題都不是短期的，例如這次的個案，其實是差不多15年的時間，不是一刹那的問題。但我亦想強調，這只是一些個案，其實醫務委員會的工作量，在處理投訴方面是相當大，過去五年，有差不多8 700個投訴個案。面對這些個案，醫務委員會都會盡快處理。不過今次這個案亦令我們作了些思考，就是在制度方面、整個流程方面，更加重要的是有沒有需要在法例──《醫生註冊條例》方面作一些修訂呢？因爲醫務委員會是受《醫生註冊條例》的規管，其實在這方面，我們一直都有做準備工作。因應這個案，我亦已發信予醫務委員會主席，希望就這個案引發出來的討論，包括對整個流程、程序，以至整個法規方面，有沒有一些需要修改的地方。我們已要求醫務委員會在八個星期內，檢討後給我們回覆，我們會在收到醫務委員會主席的意見後，進一步在立法和修訂法律方面作考慮。

至於今次的個案，我覺得相當難過。不論涉事的醫生有沒有違反操守或失當──這要留給醫務委員會去判斷──黎先生兩夫妻過去十多年照顧身體有殘障的小朋友，我對他們非常佩服，亦明白他們的困難。可以這樣說，黎先生夫婦其實對香港的醫療非常信任，所以來到香港。而十多年來，他亦對我們的制度很信任，他一直默默等待一個結果、一個答案，我相信我們的制度會給予他一個答案。不論最終判斷的結果是甚麽，我相信他需要的是一個答案。在此我也藉着這個機會問候他，希望黎小朋友可以健康成長，亦希望黎先生對香港的醫療制度不會失望。我們不會令他失望。

記者：剛才提及有關修訂法例上有甚麽可行性存在﹖之前有出現過可能增加一些初步研訊委員會，是否循這個方向﹖或有甚麽其他方案可以處理醫委會如此沉重的壓力﹖另外，局長之前指會援助相關夫婦，暫時有否跟他們接觸﹖他們的反應如何﹖

醫務衞生局局長：先講一講黎氏夫婦和其小朋友的情况，因爲黎小朋友是香港居民，他在香港出生，所以在這方面，他是香港的一個兒子，我們都會盡量給他幫助，例如特殊教育或者其他福利方面，我們會盡量去支援，所有香港市民都有此權利，而政府亦有責任去照顧他，所以無論是社會福利署，以至教育局都會為他提供適切的援助。

至於剛才提到醫務委員會在處理投訴方面有甚麽可以改進的地方，我強調，醫務委員會秘書處是醫務委員會工作的一個重要的部分，我們會看幾個層面：首先在政府方面，我們強調，醫務委員會是一個法定的獨立機構，其運作是獨立的，政府主要的責任就是去看《醫生註冊條例》方面，特別是關於例如醫務委員會的組成部分、有多少委員，以至它的一些法定職能，例如其PIC（初步偵訊委員會Preliminary Investigation Committee）或inquiry panel，即研訊小組。我們會從這方面去看，還有法例的一些規條、流程，我們會看看怎樣令整個過程更為流暢，甚至希望提升其效率，令一些投訴個案能更快地處理，或者訂立一些目標。至於秘書處，它由衞生署監督管理，他們為醫務委員會提供援助，我們會考慮其人手方面，以至工作上，在處理這些個案時有沒有可以改善的地方。當然，其實所有工作，我強調，無論是哪個職位，都有本身的權與責，有權就一定有責，我們會看看整個醫委會，以至秘書處工作時遇到的困難，如果秘書處有些同事在處理時遇到困難，我們會看看怎樣幫他們解決。

記者：局長，昨日基孔肯雅熱本地個案又新增多一宗，其實現時基孔肯雅熱在香港的風險是否仍然是高？第二題也是想跟進醫委會的覆核個案，其實中間十幾年來醫生都不斷擱置聆訊，其實在制度上在改革的時候是否會考慮限制擱置的次數？還有，現在這麼遲才重新聆訊，會否擔心影響最後的結果？

醫務衞生局局長：關於這個個案，醫委會的決定我們會留待醫務委員會去處理，因為處理這些個別個案是醫務委員會的權力，而根據《醫生註冊條例》，即香港法例第161章第21條亦強調，醫務委員會的研訊小組作出一個決定後，可以在14日內由它自己主動作出覆核。這裏要強調，只有這研訊小組有權作出覆核的決定，決定並不是外人可以去做，所以在這事件判決最終達致的決定，完全是由醫務委員會的研訊小組作出決定，外人不應該干預，它亦有自我覆核的權力以至責任。其實醫務委員會好像是醫療界別的法庭、法律機構，它在很多方面的流程以至行事都要依據法律執行，所以這是其中他們要面對的壓力。希望大家給醫務委員會的研訊小組一個空間，根據其權力與責任將今次的個案重新去覆核。

至於基孔肯雅熱，我想強調，基孔肯雅熱是一個可防、可控的傳染病，亦可以說一般是不用怎樣治療，因爲沒有一個特別的治療，主要是處理症狀方面，而絕大部分病人都可以順利康復，嚴重的併發甚至死亡率是非常非常低，是低於千分之一。它亦不是人傳人的病，是通過蚊作爲媒介，若由一個人傳給另一個人，就要剛巧一個感染的人被一隻白紋伊蚊叮了，該隻蚊感染病毒，然後再由這隻已感染的蚊剛好叮了另一個人，所以與以往大家市民可能很擔心在人與人之間傳播的傳染病，好像新冠，是有很大的分別。

​當然，任何可以傳染的病我們都很重視，小心面對，基孔肯雅熱最重要的一點就是要做好控蚊工作，希望整個社會都支持，政府部門亦會做好這件事。不過，天氣其實開始轉涼，香港都有冬天，可能現在冬天比較短，這給予我們機會更好地去做好防蚊工作。但我們不能只靠天氣，我們需要自己做好控蚊的工作，希望大家可以一起合作，我們很有信心可以控制得好。其他詳細資料我請衞生防護中心總監，亦是署理衞生署署長徐樂堅醫生跟大家解釋。

署理衞生署署長：正如局長所說，基孔肯雅熱其實是一種蚊媒傳播疾病，大家要了解，今年基孔肯雅熱在全球的活躍情況比過往高很多。市民外遊時無可避免會有風險把病毒帶到香港。所以，如果市民的居住地方有可以讓蚊滋生的環境，風險仍然存在。

​自今年（八月）第一宗輸入個案發生後，政府的跨部門工作組一直處理這些輸入個案。其中一項工作是我們（衞生署衞生防護中心）會和食物環境衞生署（食環署）一起在所有輸入個案曾到訪的地點加強滅蚊控蚊工作。在過去大約半年，我們亦和醫生和醫院建立了一個監測網絡，以期盡快找出輸入個案。因此我們在檢測的能力上、醫生診斷病人和轉介個案上，全部均已加強。當然，最重要的是教育市民。近半年以來，我們不斷發布資訊、輸入個案的資料等，讓市民知道有甚麼症狀需要看醫生。

​近日的三宗本地個案，慶幸都是在發病初期已經去看醫生，很快可以作出一個診斷。因此，我們可以有較大機會在較高風險的區域做更多滅蚊控蚊工作，希望將帶病毒的蚊盡快控制得到。現時我們正在數個區域做一些重點的工作，包括上個星期開始的黃大仙鳳德邨。在該區域進行加強控蚊工作外，我們聯絡了超過11 000名居民，亦得悉大部分居民都沒有症狀。40位有輕微症狀的市民，我們亦盡快為他們做測試，確認了39位都對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性，一位的化驗仍在進行中。所以我們這樣快完成工作，是希望可以盡快將風險降到最低。

​昨日公布一宗新增的本地個案，涉及的一名市民曾在幾個區域出現，亦與過往一些輸入個案有些重疊的地方。我們正進行流行病學工作，包括基因分析。就三個新地區，包括青衣、上環信德中心附近和葵涌廣場一帶，我們與食環署已經重點地加強滅蚊控蚊工作。和我們過往的工作一樣，我們會加強與有關地區市民的聯繫。我們亦在三個區各設立了一個醫護站，可以方便市民找到我們，解答他們的疑問或評估他們症狀。簡單來說，就這幾個較高風險地方，我們已經進行了一系列工作，我們希望近半年來跨部門的工作可以將風險降到最低。"

尊敬的祁斌副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李江舟副署長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署副署長）、包海斌主任（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署政策研究室主任）、尊敬的谷澍董事長（中國農業銀行董事長）、肖彬行長（中國農業銀行香港分行行長）：

大家好！今天很高興出席中國農業銀行（農行）的答謝會，與各位共同見證農行香港分行成立三十周年這個重要的時刻。

回顧過去三十載，中資銀行在香港發展的歷程，可以說是與香港的經濟繁榮息息相關。中資銀行是香港銀行體系的重要參與者，是堅定支持香港金融穩定和高質量發展的中流砥柱。不管內外經濟環境如何變化，中資銀行始終積極支持香港的經濟建設與社會發展，為在港企業持續成長和發展提供有力支撐，為市民提供優質貼心的服務。

農行香港分行自一九九五年成立以來，時刻秉持「誠信立業、穩健行遠」的信念，從一家起步於香港的境外分行，逐步壯大成為農行中資產規模最大、盈利能力最強的境外機構。這既是農行在香港市場發展有方，也是香港金融業蓬勃發展的生動寫照。

三十年來，農行香港分行積極參與香港金融市場建設，成為債券通、滬港通、深港通等項目的首批結算銀行，並在離岸人民幣業務、跨境貿易結算、資產管理、證券、保險等領域多元發展。其全方位的發展，不僅體現了中資銀行在支持香港深化國際聯繫所起的關鍵作用，更彰顯了香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的獨特角色和優勢。

展望未來，在「十五五」規劃建議下，國家將繼續高水平雙向對外開放，加快高水平科技自立自強，積極推動科技創新和產業創新深度融合。國家明確支持香港鞏固提升國際金融、航運、貿易中心地位、建設國際創新科技中心，而粵港澳大灣區建設和「一帶一路」倡議亦將持續推進，這些發展都為中資銀行提供更廣闊的發展舞台。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，金融是經濟發展的血液。我深信農行將把握好國家和香港的發展機遇，助力香港鞏固提升籌融資中心和境外離岸人民幣業務樞紐等地位，並積極支持內地和香港的企業拓展國際業務，支持香港經濟社會的高質量發展。

最後，祝願農行香港分行在未來的發展竿頭猛進，與我們共同為香港的繁榮穩定、為國家的強國建設和民族復興偉業作出新的、更大的貢獻！

謝謝大家。"

"18111 Mental Health Support Hotline launches new features to offer more thoughtful, convenient, and comprehensive mental health support services (with photos)",2025-11-04 18:35,2025-11-04 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400499.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, officiated at the 18111 Mental Health Support Hotline: the New Features Launch Ceremony today (November 4). He also announced that the 18111 Mental Health Support Hotline launched four new features today to offer more thoughtful, convenient, and comprehensive services, with a view to further enhancing mental health support for members of the public.

  Professor Lo said, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been attaching great importance to the mental health of the public and has been promoting the development of relevant services through an integrated approach. In the 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive proposed a number of mental health-related measures, further enhancing mental health services through a strategy of identification, intervention and treatment, with equal emphasis on prevention, including the creation of supportive environments in schools and workplaces.

  ""The Government launched the 18111 Mental Health Support Hotline in December 2023 to provide 24-hour, one-stop emotional and mental health support. As of the end of October this year, the Hotline has handled nearly 220 000 calls, which was an average of around 330 calls per day, demonstrating our commitment to providing round-the-clock and one-stop support for members of public.

  ""Drawing on 22 months of operational experience of the 18111 Mental Health Support Hotline, we have introduced four new features for the Hotline to respond to various needs of the public, offering more thoughtful, convenient, and comprehensive emotional support to the public. Should any members of the public be in mental distress or have mental health needs, I encourage them to call the Hotline to seek appropriate support. The Hotline will, as always, stand ready to chat, and we are all ears.""

  The four new features of the 18111 Mental Health Support Hotline are as follows:

(1) WhatsApp support

  Having regard to modern communication habits of the public, the Hotline now offers WhatsApp support, allowing them to send instant messages to the 18111 Mental Health Support Hotline and receive immediate online support from trained personnel. This feature is not only suitable for young people and persons in need who may feel hesitant or find it inconvenient to make phone calls, but also enables citizens with hearing or speech impairments to seek assistance in a more convenient manner, thereby enhancing the service's flexibility and accessibility.

(2) Multi-language support

  The 18111 Mental Health Support Hotline now supports 12 languages. In addition to the original Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, the Hotline has expanded to support nine ethnic minority languages, namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Punjabi, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Bengali, and Thai. This enhancement improves service accessibility, enabling people using different languages to receive the support they need.

(3) Scheduled callback

  Members of the public can now schedule a callback at a convenient time in advance via phone, voicemail, or WhatsApp. Trained personnel will contact them at a scheduled time, offering more flexible and thoughtful mental health support.

(4) Additional optional services

  Apart from talking with personnel of the Hotline, members of the public can opt to receive information on support services and stress management techniques or listen to life stories shared by persons in mental recovery on ways to cope with difficult situations and experiences in seeking help (Real People Library). These options, available via voice navigation or WhatsApp, enable members of the public to have instant access to information on other support services and advice on emotional relief.

  Professor Lo expressed gratitude to the Advisory Committee on Mental Health (ACMH), as well as all organisations and stakeholders promoting mental health services. He said, ""Mental health is not only a personal matter but also a social responsibility. I believe that, with the concerted efforts of the Government, various sectors of the community and families, Hong Kong will become a more caring society that places greater emphasis on mental health.""

  The Chairman of the ACMH, Dr Lam Ching-choi, who also officiated at the Launch Ceremony, said, ""Mental health is a vital cornerstone of the sense of well-being in society. I hope every citizen in need will have a place to turn for help and feel the care and support. The new features of the 18111 Mental Health Support Hotline address the various needs of the public, marking a significant step forward in mental health support services. By launching the new features, I hope the support services can be extended to more people, offering more diverse and flexible support options for the public.""

  Other officiating guests are the Acting Director of Health, Dr Edwin Tsui, and Deputy Secretary for Health Mr Eddie Lee. Members of the ACMH, as well as representatives from various non-governmental organisations and mental and emotional support service groups, also attended the Launch Ceremony to show their support for enhancing mental health initiatives."

​財政司司長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-11-04 18:00,2025-11-04 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400509.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（十一月四日）在國際金融領袖投資峰會會見傳媒的談話內容：

財政司司長：大家早晨，很多謝大家今日抽時間到國際金融領袖投資峰會。今次峰會有大概300位金融領袖出席，其中100位是全球最大金融機構的主席或行政總裁，另外200位是其他高層管理人員。據我們了解，至少有一半以上是從外面到來參加這峰會。這個峰會可以說是全球矚目的金融界盛會，很多今次參會的國際金融領袖跟我們說，他們現在每年都會記下我們下一年大概是甚麼時間舉行，納入來年出訪行程的計劃。

第二，我想藉此機會，再次代表特區政府衷心感謝中央和內地相關的金融監管機構，對我們舉辦這峰會的大力支持和幫助。今早，何立峰副總理（國務院副總理）通過視頻發表了講話，三個中央主要金融監管機構都派了高級的領導來香港，親自講解相關政策。這方面其實很重要，根據我們過往的經驗，跟與會者交流時，他們都很珍惜可以現場直接聽到內地金融監管機構的官員講解內地監管政策的最新發展。

第三點想提的是，這個峰會可以說是已發展成香港的品牌活動。正如剛才跟大家所說，不少國際金融領袖，以及一些在香港的金融界朋友，已經將這活動列入每年必定要去的盛會，有很多人都爭取我們邀請他們參加。

最後一點，這次金融峰會和金融科技周同一時間舉行，發揮了很好的聯乘效應，讓金融領袖不單能參加峰會，若時間許可的話，亦可參加金融科技周，這亦幫助我們吸引了很多金融科技的企業和代表到來，對於香港的金融發展，大家有更深入的了解，亦通過這個機會，大家有更加豐富的交流。

接下來，看看大家有甚麼提問，謝謝。

記者：見到香港今年的資本市場表現不錯，股市都有不錯的升幅，你與金融領袖溝通時，你覺得他們對於香港的信心有沒有增加？他們對於香港的信心增加的話，有沒有說可能在投資額或者香港招聘人手方面，有沒有一個增長的趨勢？如果有這樣的驅動的話，對於今年香港的經濟增長會否都有一個比較好的表現？

財政司司長：今次我們舉辦這個峰會，有機會親自與這些從外面來的金融領袖面對面交流，大家可以坦誠地交換意見。今年來說，他們整體對香港市場是感到頗樂觀。

今年以來，IPO，即首次上市集資，香港是全球領先。現時正排隊到港上市的企業約有二百多至三百間。對餘下一段時間的股票市場發展，他們均表示感到積極和樂觀。

這個勢頭非常好。內地鼓勵其企業到海外發展，其中一個就是到香港籌集資金，支持他們發展的計劃。較早前的寧德時代便是一例。

我向他們解釋，香港在「一國兩制」下，這個雙向平台作用在今次非常顯著。剛才提到譬如寧德時代這類內地企業，他們要到海外發展，利用香港這個平台籌集資金，用我們的專業服務一起出去。

同時，稍後會有一間中東企業來上市。我今次到中東，以及較早前到美國紐約，與當地的投資界和其他業界交流時，亦都看到他們對投資香港和內地市場，很有興趣。而過去一段時間，由去年九月尾開始到現在，股票市場背後的資金流入，我們都做過一些分析，大概一半是「南向通」，即是內地投資者的資金，另一半資金是來自歐美等的投資者，可以說香港這個雙向平台作用和國際金融中心的地位非常顯著。

至於剛才你問到有沒有企業在此增加招聘，可能大家都留意到，金融界當然有，有些在中環、有些在西九，均有擴充其寫字樓，亦都增聘人手，尤其做資產管理、財富管理方面的業務。

此外，大家留意新聞的話，都會見到有科技公司到香港擴充業務，租用整幢大廈多層，亦有個別企業甚至購買整幢商業大廈來使用。

我們在接觸內地或歐美，以至中東和東南亞市場時，他們對於香港市場的蓬勃氣氛，均感覺積極正面，亦部署到此擴充業務。

記者：司長，你好。今日國務院副總理何立峰在視頻發言提到，希望香港把握「十五五」的機遇，與內地金融合作相關方面，請問有沒有新的計劃或舉措可以分享？特別是政府成立了出海專班，在協助內地企業出海方面，有沒有新的動向？謝謝。

財政司司長：何立峰副總理的發言指出，國家全力支持香港國際金融、航運、貿易等「三中心、一高地」的發展。剛才我提到的雙向平台的作用，過往來說，大家回看由改革開放開始的一九七八年到現在，香港都很着力吸引外資到內地投資、興業。現時說的更是雙向開放，同時鼓勵內地企業布局全球。內地企業出海，到東南亞、中東也好，這個趨勢，我們覺得是明顯的。

最近我出團到中東，組團時除了香港企業，我們都找了一些內地大灣區的企業，希望大家拼船出海，增加出海的實力；同時亦助力當地實體經濟的發展。換句話說，除了跟中東地區雙向的資金往來外，在創科、初創、基建投資、建築等多方面，大家有更多交流合作。可以這樣說，我們展開了前期的工作，往後會繼續推進這方面的工作。在十二月，我們會迎來一家中東的公司在這裏做路演、招商引資，也都希望這邊做建築、基建的企業能到他們那邊發展。謝謝大家。"
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for dealing with and importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-11-04 17:41,2025-11-04 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400489.htm,"One incoming passenger was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment and fined by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (November 4) for dealing with and importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted a 45-year-old incoming female passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on September 6. About 140 600 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $577,000 and a duty potential of about $465,000, were seized from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

The passenger was sentenced to eight months' imprisonment and fined in contravention of the DCO today.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

海關人員九月六日在香港國際機場截查一名四十五歲的抵港女旅客，並在她的個人行李內檢獲約十四萬零六百支未完稅香煙，市值約五十七萬七千元，應課稅值約四十六萬五千元。該名抵港旅客隨即被捕。

該名旅客今日就違反《條例》，被判處監禁八個月和罰款。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

Among the eighth batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering 15 survey areas in October, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released eight batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 43 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index the previous month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Nineteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

十月份第八批涵蓋15個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共八批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，43個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有19區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
Speech by FS at Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit luncheon (English only) (with photos/video),2025-11-04 16:45,2025-11-04 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400474.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit luncheon today (November 4):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon.

  A very warm welcome to the Investment Summit luncheon.

  Like many of you, I am very much looking forward to the fireside chat featuring Larry Fink (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock) and Ken Griffin (Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Citadel).

  Before we hear from them, allow me to offer an update of Hong Kong to whet your appetite.

Trekking a shifting terrain

  History tells us that the world's great financial centres do not stand still. Their success depends on their ability to serve the economy, anticipate what lies ahead, embrace technological advancement, and adapt to shifting mega trends.

  Hong Kong is no exception. Today, once again, we are at a moment of profound transformation - one defined by shifting geopolitics, regional integration, rapid technological advancement and climate challenges. But these are not necessarily headwinds. In fact, they can be powerful tailwinds for those ready to respond with agility and vision.

A renewed role as a super connector

  At the heart of our response is an elevated role for Hong Kong as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" - one that connects markets, capital, innovation and opportunity across borders and regions. That role is now being shaped by a few converging forces.

  First, a global shift from globalisation to regionalisation. Trade and economic co-operation within regional blocs - like Asia - are gaining momentum. We see this in the expansion of frameworks like the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) and the CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership), and most recently, the FTA 3.0 between China and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). These developments are reshaping global trade and investment patterns, and Hong Kong stands at a strategic position.

  Second, many economies are actively seeking diversification in economies, markets, sources of capital, supply chains and others. The Middle East, for example, is increasingly looking eastward. Trade between the Gulf and emerging Asia has been growing at some 7 per cent annually over the past decade or so, and trade between Saudi Arabia and China is expected to surpass that with the West by 2027. These statistics reflect not merely a change in trade flows but a structural shift in strategic orientation and cross-border co-operation.

  Third, China's development must be reckoned on multiple fronts. Despite a complex global environment, our country continues to press ahead with high-quality development. The recent Fourth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee has laid out recommendations for the country's 15th Five-Year Plan. It has reaffirmed China's commitment to high-level two-way opening up. It has placed emphasis on technological self-reliance, with strong support for technology and innovation across the entire value chain. And the deep integration of technological innovation with industry development is particularly noteworthy.

  All of the above developments are elevating Hong Kong's role as a two-way platform for trade, investments and technological collaboration.

International financial centre

  As part of the national strategy, Mainland enterprises are being encouraged to go global in the attempt to reconfigure their supply chain and industry chain. As they do so, they look to Hong Kong not only for capital, but also for a full suite of high-value services.

  At the same time, capital is flowing to this part of the world, too.

  Investors' optimism has grown particularly since the DeepSeek moment earlier this year - where the technological prowess of China surprised the global investment and tech communities. And their valuation is highly attractive. 

  Separately, we have noticed strong interest in our capital market from the Global South. They are seeking capital to support their ambitious infrastructure and economic development plans.

  The Middle East is a good example. Last year, we strengthened cross-border collaboration with Saudi Arabia through mutual listing of ETF (exchange-traded fund)'s tracking each other's market. Now, we will soon welcome the first Middle Eastern company to list on our stock exchange. In fact, our financial regulators have already signed MOUs with their respective counterparts for cross-border regulatory collaboration, paving the way for more companies to list here or to do a dual listing on both stock exchanges.

Innovation and technology: a new growth engine

  Another important development in Hong Kong is our ambition in innovation and technology.

  Over the past few years, we have made over HK$200 billion in related investments and laid out a clear strategic roadmap to nurture technology and innovation as a new engine of growth - from supporting basic and translational research, nurturing start-ups, to attracting global and Mainland enterprises and talent to Hong Kong, and rolling out special initiatives to promote advanced manufacturing. The aim is to integrate technology and innovation with industry development.

  Our focus is on four key areas, namely AI and data science, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials, and the carrier of this vision is the Northern Metropolis.

  If I may use AI, one of the key areas of focus, as an example to elaborate further. We adopt a twin-engine strategy: developing AI as a core industry, and promoting AI as an enabler to upgrade traditional sectors. We call this ""AI+"". Our strategy rests on six pillars: computing power, algorithms, data, application scenarios, capital and talent.

  Apart from building a supercomputing centre and experimenting with cross-boundary flows of data and biosamples from the Mainland to Hong Kong, we have been going all out to attract leading companies engaged in cutting-edge technologies. So far, we have attracted over 100 such enterprises.

  This is supported by a vibrant ecosystem of some 4,700 tech start-ups, many of them are based in our Science Park and Cyberport.

  As to talent, we have modified the various talent admission schemes since the end of 2022. To date, we have received more than 540,000 applications, approved about 360,000 of them. And more than 240,000 individuals have arrived in Hong Kong.

  Of course, these technology companies need capital to scale. Beyond the full spectrum of funding options available, from angel investors to IPOs (initial public offerings), we have established the Hong Kong Investment Corporation as patient capital to channel private capital into sectors that we would like to develop, such as deep tech, biotech and green tech.

Reinventing Hong Kong

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong's story has always been one of reinventing itself, time and again. We capitalise on our unique strengths under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, and ride through the waves of changes and challenges with determination, agility and perseverance.

  Thank you for walking this journey with us over the years. Your support has been highly appreciated. I wish you all an enjoyable luncheon and a thought-provoking conversation ahead. Bon appétit."
二零二五年第三季食肆收益及購貨額臨時統計數字,2025-11-04 16:30,2025-11-04 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400303.htm,"政府統計處今日（十一月四日）發表最新的食肆收益及購貨額臨時數字。

二零二五年第三季的食肆總收益價值的臨時估計為267億元，維持在去年同期的相若水平。同期間，食肆購貨總額的臨時估計為86億元，按年下跌1.0%。

扣除其間價格變動的影響後，二零二五年第三季的食肆總收益以數量計的臨時估計較上年同季下跌1.4%。

按食肆類別分析，二零二五年第三季與二零二四年第三季比較，中式餐館的總收益以價值計及數量計分別下跌3.5%及4.8%。非中式餐館的總收益以價值計及數量計分別上升3.7%及3.2%。快餐店的總收益以價值計上升0.3%，但以數量計則下跌1.0%。酒吧的總收益以價值計及數量計分別上升2.4%及1.0%。至於雜類飲食場所，其總收益以價值計及數量計分別下跌4.0%及5.6%。

二零二五年第三季與上季比較，經季節性調整的食肆總收益的臨時估計以價值計及數量計分別下跌0.8%及1.7%。

二零二五年首三季與二零二四年同期比較，食肆總收益以價值計大致維持不變，但以數量計則下跌1.2%。

為方便進一步了解飲食業的短期業務表現，政府統計處亦編製有關季度內個別月份的食肆收益及購貨額統計數字。

按月份分析，二零二五年七月、八月及九月與上年相同月份比較，食肆總收益價值的臨時估計分別上升1.3%、上升1.2%及下跌3.6%。

扣除價格變動的影響後，與上年相同月份比較，二零二五年七月、八月及九月的食肆總收益以數量計的臨時估計分別上升0.2%、上升0.1%及下跌4.6%。

評論

政府發言人表示，第三季食肆總收益價值按年微跌0.3%。收益價值繼在七月及八月上升後，在九月下跌，主要是由於中秋節今年在十月初，去年則在九月中旬，令比較基數較高，以及月內極端天氣情況更頻繁所致。

展望未來，本地消費氣氛逐步改善，就業收入上升，以及訪港旅遊業持續增長，應為食肆業務表現務帶來一定支持。

Provisional statistics of restaurant receipts and purchases for third quarter of 2025,2025-11-04 16:30,2025-11-04 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400306.htm,"The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released the latest provisional figures on restaurant receipts and purchases today (November 4).

The value of total receipts of the restaurants sector in the third quarter of 2025, provisionally estimated at $26.7 billion, remained at a similar level when compared with a year earlier. Over the same period, the provisional estimate of the value of total purchases by restaurants decreased by 1.0% to $8.6 billion.

After netting out the effect of price changes over the same period, the provisional estimate of the volume of total restaurant receipts decreased by 1.4% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with a year earlier.

Analysed by type of restaurant and comparing the third quarter of 2025 with the third quarter of 2024, total receipts of Chinese restaurants decreased by 3.5% in value and 4.8% in volume. Total receipts of non-Chinese restaurants increased by 3.7% in value and 3.2% in volume. Total receipts of fast food shops increased by 0.3% in value, but decreased by 1.0% in volume. Total receipts of bars increased by 2.4% in value and 1.0% in volume. As for miscellaneous eating and drinking places, total receipts decreased by 4.0% in value and 5.6% in volume.

Based on the seasonally adjusted series, the provisional estimate of total restaurant receipts decreased by 0.8% in value and 1.7% in volume in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the preceding quarter.

Comparing the first three quarters of 2025 with the same period in 2024, total restaurant receipts remained virtually unchanged in value but decreased by 1.2% in volume.

To facilitate further understanding of the short-term business performance of the restaurants sector, statistics in respect of the restaurant receipts and purchases in individual months of the reference quarter are also compiled.

Analysed by month, it was provisionally estimated that the value of total receipts of the restaurants sector increased by 1.3%, increased by 1.2% and decreased by 3.6% respectively in July, August and September 2025, compared with the corresponding months in 2024.

After discounting the effect of price changes, it was provisionally estimated that the volume of total restaurant receipts increased by 0.2%, increased by 0.1% and decreased by 4.6% respectively in July, August and September 2025, compared with the corresponding months in 2024.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that the value of total restaurant receipts declined slightly by 0.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier. Following the increases in July and August, the value of receipts declined in September mainly due to the high base of comparison as the Mid-Autumn Festival fell in early October this year but in mid-September last year, as well as more occurrences of extreme weather conditions during the month.

Looking ahead, restaurant business performance should be underpinned by improving local consumption sentiment, the increase in employment earnings, and the sustained growth in inbound tourism.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on November 3 to noon today (November 4), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 121 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

放寬停車場總樓面面積豁免安排十一月實施,2025-11-04 16:00,2025-11-04 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400332.htm,"發展局今日（十一月四日）公布，由十一月起實施經優化的私人發展項目停車場總樓面面積豁免安排，以及一系列相關措施。

優化措施於二○二五年《施政報告》提出，容許地面不多於兩層停車場的總樓面面積獲全數豁免，亦無須以興建部分停車場於地庫作為先決條件。由於地面停車場的建築成本較低，施工時間亦較短，措施將有效降低建築成本和加快發展，自公布以來獲業界歡迎。

上述措施適用於私人發展項目內的兩類停車場：「私人停車場」（又稱「附屬停車場」），即為滿足發展項目住戶和訪客的泊位需求而提供的停車場，以及「公共停車場」，即政府按當區泊位需要，要求發展商在項目內向公眾提供的泊位。

此外，地面第三層或以上的停車場，不論屬私人或公共停車場，將一律獲50%總樓面面積豁免，不再如過往般按「私人停車場」或「公共停車場」而有不同安排。

除以上改動外，有關停車場總樓面面積豁免的其他安排將繼續生效，例如所有地庫停車場（不論屬私人或公共停車場）將繼續獲全數豁免總樓面面積等。

為配合優化措施的實施，政府會簡化審批地面停車場高度限制的城規程序，詳情如下：

（a）發展商如因為興建地面不多於兩層的停車場而提出規劃申請以便輕微放寬高度限制，大部分情況只需就用地提交視覺評估及（如用地涉及主要通風廊）簡單通風影響評估；以及
（b）規劃署已檢視新發展區情況，當中大部分發展用地的高度限制均可以容納兩層地面停車場。至於新發展區內餘下需要放寬高度限制的用地，政府明年會按城規程序主動作出申請。

優化安排的詳情見於屋宇署已更新的《認可人士、註冊結構工程師及註冊岩土工程師作業備考APP-2》（www.bd.gov.hk/doc/en/resources/codes-and-references/practice-notes-and-circular-letters/pnap/APP/APP002.pdf）（只有英文版）；以及地政總署最新的《地政處作業備考9/2025》（www.landsd.gov.hk/doc/en/practice-note/lpn/PN%209_2025.pdf）（只有英文版）。前者詳列優化措施的執行細節，後者詳列優化措施的土地行政執行細節，包括私人地面停車場如需申請全數豁免總樓面面積，補地價金額會以標準金額計算，無需逐宗個案以傳統估價方式評估。"

Relaxed gross floor area exemption arrangements for carparks to commence in November,2025-11-04 16:00,2025-11-04 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400339.htm,"The Development Bureau announced today (November 4) that the enhanced gross floor area (GFA) exemption arrangements for carparks in private development projects, together with a series of related measures, will take effect starting from November.

The enhanced measure was put forward in the 2025 Policy Address. The measure will allow full GFA exemption for no more than two levels of aboveground carparks, while doing away with the prerequisite of constructing some of the carparks underground. Since the construction cost for aboveground carparks is lower and the construction time is shorter, the measure will effectively reduce construction costs and expedite developments. The measure has been welcomed by the trade since its announcement.

The above measure will be applicable to both types of carparks in private development projects: ""private carparks"" (also known as ""ancillary carparks""), i.e. carparks provided to address parking needs of residents and visitors of the development project; and ""public carparks"", i.e. parking spaces provided by the developers in the project for the general public, as per the Government's requirement considering local parking needs.

Furthermore, for the third aboveground carpark level and beyond, 50 per cent of GFA exemption will be allowed, be it a private or public carpark, unlike past arrangements in which private and public carparks were subject to different arrangements.

Besides the above changes, other arrangements pertaining to carpark GFA exemption will continue to apply, such as all underground carparks (regardless of whether private or public) continuing to enjoy full GFA exemption, etc.

To facilitate the implementation of the enhanced measure, town planning procedures will be streamlined for approving height restrictions relevant to aboveground carparks. The details are as follows:

(a) If developers submit planning applications for minor relaxation of height restrictions because of constructing no more than two levels of aboveground carparks, under most circumstances, they will only be required to submit visual appraisals and, if the site involves major breezeways, simple reviews of the air ventilation impact assessment; and
(b) The Planning Department has reviewed the situation at New Development Areas (NDAs), where most development sites have height restrictions sufficient to accommodate two levels of aboveground carparks. For the remaining sites in NDAs where relaxation of height restrictions is required, the Government will initiate applications in accordance with town planning procedures next year.

Details of the enhanced arrangements can be found at the Building Department's updated Practice Note for Authorized Persons, Registered Structural Engineers and Registered Geotechnical Engineers APP-2 (www.bd.gov.hk/doc/en/resources/codes-and-references/practice-notes-and-circular-letters/pnap/APP/APP002.pdf); as well as the Lands Department's latest Lands Administration Office Practice Note 9/2025 (www.landsd.gov.hk/doc/en/practice-note/lpn/PN%209_2025.pdf). The former sets out implementation details of enhanced measures, while the latter sets out relevant land administrative details for the enhanced measure, including that for applications seeking full GFA exemption for aboveground private carparks, the premium can be calculated based on the standard rate, without the need for a case-by-case assessment using the conventional approach."

消防處與香港中文大學簽署合作備忘錄　合辦緊急護理和應急準備培訓學科（附圖）,2025-11-04 15:40,2025-11-04 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400198.htm,"消防處與香港中文大學（中大）今日（十一月四日）簽署合作備忘錄，由消防及救護學院與中大的體育運動科學系和賽馬會公共衞生及基層醫療學院合作，共同舉辦有關緊急護理及應急準備的培訓課程，推動社區安全教育和青年全面發展。

培訓課程將涵蓋心肺復甦法、使用自動心臟除顫器、防火安全、緊急撤離程序及運動傷害應急處理等實用技能與知識，旨在提升學生自我保護意識與應急處置能力，進一步強化社區整體應急水平。

消防處一直積極制訂並推行社區應急準備策略，而中大體育運動科學系和賽馬會公共衞生及基層醫療學院分別在體育健康與公共衞生領域擔當人才培養的重要角色。此次合作將有助消防處深化「社區為本」的公眾安全教育，促進跨領域協同，共建更安全、更具韌性的香港。

備忘錄由消防及救護學院副院長（救護訓練）張珈甄、中大體育運動科學系主任王香生教授，以及中大賽馬會公共衞生及基層醫療學院院長黃仰山教授共同簽署，並由消防及救護學院院長趙汝珏、中大教育學院院長范息濤教授和中大醫學院院長趙偉仁教授見證簽署儀式。

趙汝珏表示，此次合作不僅為學生提供學術以外的實用技能訓練，更有助提升他們在處理心臟驟停等緊急情況時的信心與能力，從而加強社區救援支持網絡，為患者爭取寶貴生機。他指出，備忘錄象徵雙方合作踏上新台階，未來將持續拓展多元培訓，裝備年輕一代迎接社會需要。此外，立法會換屆選舉臨近，趙汝珏亦呼籲在場人士於十二月七日投票，履行公民責任。

范息濤教授及趙偉仁教授感謝消防處對是次合作的支援。范息濤教授表示，修讀培訓課程的學生通可融合學科知識和應急安全意識，從而提高警覺性與解難能力，在社區中發揮互助精神。趙偉仁教授認為今次合作讓醫學教育更貼近社區和回應時代需要，亦能培養學生以人為本的精神，以及在危難時刻敢於行動的理念。

相關培訓課程將被納入中大教育學士（健康與體育運動科學）、理學士（運動科學與健康教育）、理學士（人體運動科學與健康研究）、公共衞生理學士、社區健康理學士，以及老年學理學士等多個學位課程的必修部分。完成課程的學生將成為「救心同仁」一員，承諾在遇到心臟驟停事故時挺身而出，以實際行動守護生命。"
FSD and CUHK sign MOU to jointly organise training module on emergency care and preparedness (with photos),2025-11-04 15:40,2025-11-04 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400201.htm,"The Fire Services Department (FSD) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today (November 4) to establish a collaborative partnership between the Fire and Ambulance Services Academy (FASA), as well as the Department of Sports Science and Physical Education and the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care of the CUHK, in organising a training module on emergency care and preparedness, with a view to promoting community safety education and the all-rounded development of young people.

The training module will cover practical skills and knowledge including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the use of automated external defibrillators, fire safety, emergency evacuation procedures, and emergency treatment of sports injuries. The purpose of the training module is to increase students' self-protection awareness and emergency response capabilities, thereby strengthening the overall emergency response level of the community.

The FSD has been formulating and implementing strategies on community emergency preparedness, while the Department of Sports Science and Physical Education and the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care of the CUHK play important roles in nurturing talent in the fields of sports and public health respectively. The collaboration will facilitate the FSD in deepening community-based public safety education, fostering cross-sectoral collaboration, and collectively building a safer and more resilient Hong Kong.

Witnessed by the Commandant of the FASA, Mr Cheu Yu-kok; the Dean of the Faculty of Education of the CUHK, Professor Fan Xitao; and the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Philip Chiu, the MOU was signed by the Deputy Commandant (Ambulance Services Training) of the FASA, Ms Kapo Cheung; the Chairperson of the Department of Sports Science and Physical Education of the CUHK, Professor Stephen Wong; and the Director of the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care of the CUHK, Professor Samuel Wong.

Mr Cheu stated that the collaboration not only provides students with practical skills training beyond academics but also helps enhance their confidence and ability in handling emergencies such as cardiac arrest, thereby strengthening the rescue support network in the community, which gives patients a precious chance of survival. He pointed out that the signing of the MOU symbolises a new stage in the co-operation between the two parties, and they will continue to expand diverse training programmes in the future to equip the young generation to meet the needs of society. Moreover, Mr Cheu appealed to the participants to cast their votes in the upcoming Legislative Council General Election on December 7 to fulfil their civic responsibility.

Professor Fan and Professor Chiu expressed their gratitude to the FSD for its support for the collaboration. Professor Fan stated that the module would enable students to integrate academic knowledge with emergency safety awareness, thereby enhancing their vigilance and problem-solving skills in emergencies and demonstrating a spirit of mutual support in the community. Professor Chiu said that the collaboration will make medical education more relevant to the community and responsive to the needs of the times, while also cultivating in students a people-oriented spirit and the courage to save lives during emergencies.

The training module will be included as a core module in the curriculum of the CUHK's Bachelor of Education in Physical Education, Exercise Science and Health; Bachelor of Science in Exercise Science and Health Education; Bachelor of Science in Human Movement Science and Health Studies; Bachelor of Science in Public Health; Bachelor of Science in Community Health Practice; and Bachelor of Science in Gerontology. Students who have completed the module will become members of the Resuscitation Alliance who pledge to step forward and protect lives through concrete actions when encountering cardiac arrest incidents."
律政司副司長在《施政報告》政策解讀學習午餐會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-11-04 15:38,2025-11-04 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400423.htm,"以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（十一月四日）在粵港澳大灣區上市公司聯合會《行政長官2025年施政報告》政策解讀學習午餐會的致辭：

尊敬的許國偉會長（粵港澳大灣區上市公司聯合會創會會長）、鍾學勇主席（粵港澳大灣區上市公司聯合會創會主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！感謝粵港澳大灣區上市公司聯合會的邀請，讓我有機會與各位商界的朋友交流。

聯合會匯聚大灣區商界領袖，積極協助大灣區企業對接國際市場，促進資本、科技及產業的深度融合，貢獻良多。

聯合會也是政府與業界之間重要的溝通橋樑，這橋樑作用，不但體現在宏觀戰略上，更體現在為會員提供高增值服務的具體舉措當中。今日的政策解讀會非常有意義：一方面透過交流分享，讓業界把握政策的重點，另一方面，我們也可以及時聽取各位企業家對特區政府政策措施的意見，為持續優化政策作準備。

關於律政司的政策措施，我今日主要分享兩個範疇。

首先是支援內地企業出海。

行政長官在今年的《施政報告》中強調香港要發揮出海平台的作用，積極協助企業開拓海外新興市場。除了由商務及經濟發展局成立內地企業出海專班外，行政長官也指示由我專責推廣香港法律服務，協同其他專業如會計、金融等，支援內地企業出海的需要。

各位都是扎根大灣區的優秀企業家，非常了解大灣區的巨大潛力，灣區內有不少具備國際競爭力的優質企業。而這些企業要想成功出海，往往離不開法律、金融和會計等優質專業服務的支援。

作為國際金融貿易中心以及國際法律樞紐，香港匯聚國際一流的專業服務資源與人才，可以充分發揮香港所長，貢獻國家所需，與內地企業拼船出海。

內地的優質企業具有龐大的出海需求，香港則擁有優質的專業服務與豐富的國際經驗。如何將需求和供應進行有效配對，成為落實支援企業出海政策的關鍵。

因此，律政司下一步的工作會聚焦法律和其他專業服務的推廣，同時加強與其他政府部門以及專業服務界別的溝通與協作，主動對接內地企業，了解需求，並整合專業服務提供者資訊。我們計劃在今年內匯整和發布專業服務領域的成功出海案例，以個案的形式，具體展示香港作為世界級跳板的獨特角色，以及香港專業服務的優勢，為內地企業提供參考。

我注意到聯合會亦有組建不同界別的專業委員會，針對上市公司在金融、法務等不同方面的發展需求，為企業提供協助，解決發展中的痛點與難點。

這與我們的工作方向不謀而合。我期待與聯合會在協助企業出海方面有更深入的交流與合作，共同服務企業的出海需求，發揮香港「走出去、引進來」的雙向平台作用。

第二個範疇是關於推動大灣區的機制對接和規則銜接，持續優化大灣區的營商環境。

就這範疇，我希望分享律政司四項重點工作。

第一，推動內地與香港法制的對接。律政司持續優化兩地的民商事司法協助安排，例如爭取提升送達司法文書的效率，跟進落實執行法院判決的安排等，務求鞏固兩地法律協助的機制，保障企業利益，提升企業處理跨境爭議的效益。

第二，便利和提升企業選擇利用香港與國際接軌的普通法制度。在中央的支持下，於今年二月開始，兩項「港資」措施的適用範圍得以擴大：「港資港法」措施已經擴展至深圳及珠海，而「港資港仲裁」措施則從內地自貿區，進一步涵蓋大灣區內地九市。

措施的落實為港資企業提供更多選擇、彈性和便利。要享受這些措施的紅利非常簡單，尤其是在座各位的公司可能本身已經或者計劃在香港上市。具體來說，上市集團中經由香港公司在大灣區內地城市，例如深圳，所設立的內地公司，將會在「港資」措施下，被視為港資企業，享受「港資」措施的優惠，包括選擇香港法律作為合同適用法，以及選擇香港作為仲裁地，以解決投資及商業活動產生的爭議，提升風險管理的效益。

第三，推動灣區內多元爭議解決機制，減低解決爭議的成本。律政司會持續推動建立大灣區仲裁員名單，並設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，透過專業資源共享及相互擴容，推動區內仲調機構採用和落實相關灣區標準，例如灣區調解規則等，為內地企業「借港出海」和外資企業「借港登陸」提供有力法律保障，減低企業解決爭議的成本。

第四，推動法律科技及創新。高水平科技是高質量發展的戰略支撐。不同行業的長足發展，離不開積極創新以及有效利用科技。在法律科技方面，律政司支持的eBRAM中心（一邦國際網上仲調中心）推出了網上交易促成平台，便利企業進行跨境商業交易，例如支援雲端會議、合同簡單範本以及網上管理交易等，同時也設有網上調解及仲裁平台，利便解決爭議。我們會持續鼓勵業界擁抱科技和創新，提升競爭力。

此外，律政司會成立跨部門工作小組，協調相關政策局檢視更廣泛應用AI（人工智能）所需的法律配套，確保法律機制有效支援科技創新，同時提供公平、安全的發展環境，保障不同持份者的合法權益。

香港的長期繁榮穩定有賴在座每一位商界領袖的持續貢獻與努力。我們律政司團隊將進一步拓展與社會不同界別的溝通渠道，廣納建言，積極完善各項政策舉措，精準回應社會發展的需求。

最後，我藉此機會呼籲大家在十二月七日積極參與立法會換屆選舉投票，共同為香港的良政善治、經濟發展、民生福利出一分力。感謝各位。"
最暖的十月,2025-11-04 15:30,2025-11-04 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400288.htm,"由於覆蓋華南的高空反氣旋較正常強，加上本月較後時候才有北方較涼的空氣抵達華南沿岸，二○二五年十月香港異常溫暖。十月平均氣溫27.4度及平均最低氣溫25.6度，兩者皆是有紀錄以來十月份的最高。而平均最高氣溫29.9度是有紀錄以來十月份的第二高。十月共錄得七個熱夜，當中包括十月十六日起的四個連續熱夜，而十月的酷熱天氣日數為四天，全部皆打破十月份的紀錄。十月亦遠較正常少雨，總雨量只有31.2毫米，是正常值120.3毫米的約百分之二十六。本年首十個月的累積雨量為2 545.2毫米，較同期正常值2 363.1毫米多約百分之八。

受高空反氣旋影響，十月首三日本港普遍天晴及酷熱。十月一日下午天文台氣溫上升至全月最高的33.6度。此外，熱帶低氣壓麥德姆於十月一日在菲律賓以東海域形成，隨後三日向西北偏西移動，橫過呂宋，靠近廣東沿岸並逐步增強為颱風。麥德姆於十月五日下午在雷州半島登陸，隨後兩日移入廣西內陸及越南北部，並逐步減弱為低壓區。十月四日本港初時大致天晴及酷熱。隨着麥德姆靠近，下午本地風勢增強。當日下午至翌日本港普遍吹強風，離岸及高地的風力曾達烈風程度，而天氣轉為多雲，有幾陣狂風驟雨及猛烈陣風。十月四日亦有雷暴。十月五日本港多處地區錄得超過10毫米雨量，而大嶼山部分地區的雨量更超過40毫米。翌日初時大致多雲及有一兩陣驟雨，但隨着麥德姆遠離，日間短暫時間有陽光。

受高空反氣旋支配，除有幾陣驟雨外，十月七日至十一日大致天晴及酷熱。天文台在十月八日錄得的最高氣溫為33.1度，是有紀錄以來最熱的寒露。隨着一道廣闊低壓槽靠近廣東沿岸，十月十二日本港天氣轉為大致多雲，有驟雨及雷暴，大嶼山及香港島錄得超過20毫米雨量。當日下午南丫島附近亦出現水龍捲。廣闊低壓槽在隨後兩日持續影響廣東沿岸。十月十四日早上本港有驟雨及雷暴，新界北部部分地區錄得超過20毫米雨量。隨着華南上空的反氣旋再度增強，除有幾陣驟雨外，十月十四日下午本港轉為普遍天晴，並持續至隨後五日。十月十八日至十九日天氣酷熱。天文台在十月十九日錄得的最低氣溫為28.2度，是有紀錄以來年內最遲出現的熱夜。

此外，熱帶低氣壓風神於十月十七日早上在菲律賓以東海域形成，隨後兩日向西北偏西移動，橫過菲律賓中部，並進入南海中部。風神於十月二十日增強為強烈熱帶風暴並靠近廣東沿岸。隨後三日風神轉向西南偏西移動，橫過海南島以南海域並逐步減弱。同時，一股強烈東北季候風於十月二十日影響華南。本港離岸吹強風。在風神與強烈東北季候風的共同影響下，十月二十一日本港普遍吹強風，高地間中達烈風程度。風神的外圍雨帶亦為本港帶來多雲及有幾陣雨的天氣。十月二十二日天氣顯著轉涼，下午大部分地區氣溫較十月十九日低約15度。而天文台氣溫在十月二十二日下降至全月最低的18.2度。受季候風及一道覆蓋華南的廣闊雲帶持續影響，隨後六日本港天氣持續普遍多雲及有幾陣雨。隨着雲帶轉薄，十月二十五日至二十六日部分時間有陽光。受一股偏東氣流影響，十月二十九日至三十日大致多雲及有一兩陣雨。隨着偏東氣流緩和，十月最後一日部分時間有陽光。

二○二五年十月有四個熱帶氣旋影響南海及北太平洋西部。

The warmest October,2025-11-04 15:30,2025-11-04 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400289.htm,"âWith a stronger than normal upper-air anticyclone covering southern China and cooler air from the north only reaching the coast of southern China later in the month, October 2025 was exceptionally warm in Hong Kong. The monthly mean temperature of 27.4 degrees and monthly mean minimum temperature of 25.6 degrees were both the highest on record for October. Moreover, the monthly mean maximum temperature of 29.9 degrees was the second highest on record. There were also in total seven hot nights including four consecutive hot nights that started from October 16, and four very hot days in the month, all breaking records for October. The month was also much drier than usual with a total rainfall of 31.2 millimetres, only about 26 per cent of the normal of 120.3 millimetres. The accumulated rainfall this year up to October was 2 545.2 millimetres, about 8 per cent above the normal of 2 363.1 millimetres for the same period.

Under the influence of an anticyclone aloft, the local weather was generally fine and very hot on the first three days of the month. The maximum temperature at the Observatory rose to 33.6 degrees on the afternoon of October 1, the highest of the month. Moreover, Matmo formed as a tropical depression over the seas east of the Philippines on October 1. It moved west-northwestwards across Luzon, edged closer to the coast of Guangdong and progressively intensified into a typhoon in the following three days. Matmo made landfall over the Leizhou Peninsula on the afternoon of October 5. It then moved across the inland areas of Guangxi and the northern part of Vietnam and progressively weakened into an area of low pressure in the next two days. Locally, the weather remained mainly fine at first and very hot on October 4. With the approach of Matmo, local winds strengthened in the afternoon. Winds were generally strong, once reaching gale force offshore and on high ground that afternoon and the next day. The weather turned cloudy with a few squally showers and violent gusts. There were also thunderstorms on October 4. More than 10 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over many places, and rainfall even exceeded 40 millimetres over parts of Lantau Island on October 5. Although it was mainly cloudy with one or two showers at first the next day, there were sunny intervals during the day as Matmo departed.

Dominated by an anticyclone aloft, apart from a few showers, it was generally fine and very hot from October 7 to 11. The maximum temperature at the Observatory rose to 33.1 degrees on October 8, the hottest Cold Dew on record. With a broad trough of low pressure edging closer to the coast of Guangdong, the weather of Hong Kong turned mainly cloudy with showers and thunderstorms on October 12, with more than 20 millimetres of rainfall recorded over Lantau Island and Hong Kong Island. A waterspout was also spotted near Lamma Island in the afternoon. The broad trough of low pressure continued to affect the coast of Guangdong in the next two days. Locally, there were showers and thunderstorms on the morning of October 14, with more than 20 millimetres of rainfall recorded over parts of the northern New Territories. With the anticyclone aloft strengthening again over southern China, apart from a few showers, the local weather turned generally fine on the afternoon of October 14 and remained so in the following five days. It was very hot on October 18 and 19. The minimum temperature recorded at the Observatory on October 19 was 28.2 degrees, making it the latest hot night of a year on record.

As well, Fengshen formed as a tropical depression over the seas east of the Philippines on the morning of October 17. It then tracked generally west-northwestwards across the central part of the Philippines and entered the central part of the South China Sea in the following two days. It intensified into a severe tropical storm and edged closer to the coast of Guangdong on October 20. It turned to move west-southwestwards across the seas south of Hainan Island and weakened progressively in the next three days. Meanwhile, an intense northeast monsoon affected southern China on October 20. Locally, winds were strong offshore. Under the combined effect of Fengshen and the intense northeast monsoon, the local winds were generally strong on October 21, occasionally reaching gale force on high ground. The outer rainbands of Fengshen also brought cloudy weather and a few rain patches to the territory. It was appreciably cooler on October 22, with temperatures over most parts of the territory in the afternoon around 15 degrees lower than those on October 19. Moreover, the temperature at the Observatory fell to a minimum of 18.2 degrees on October 22, the lowest of the month. Under the continuous influence of the monsoon and a broad band of clouds covering southern China, the weather remained generally cloudy with a few rain patches during the following six days. With the band of clouds thinning out, there were sunny periods on October 25 and 26. Affected by an easterly airstream, it was mainly cloudy with one or two rain patches on October 29 and 30. With the moderation of the easterly airstream, there were sunny periods on the last day of the month.

Four tropical cyclones occurred over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific in October 2025.

Details of issuances and cancellations of various warnings/signals in the month are summarised in Table 1. Monthly meteorological figures and departures from normal for October are tabulated in Table 2."

盧寵茂教授說：「香港特別行政區政府一直高度重視市民的精神健康，並持續透過綜合模式推動相關服務的發展。行政長官在《二○二五年施政報告》中提出多項與精神健康相關的措施，進一步加強精神健康服務，以識別、介入和治療為策略，同時亦重視預防，包括構建友善學校與職場環境等。」

「政府在二○二三年十二月推出『情緒通』18111熱線，提供24小時一站式情緒及精神健康支援。截至今年十月底，熱線已接聽近220 000個來電，即每日平均接聽約330個來電，展現了我們為市民提供全天候、一站式支援的努力。」

「我們總結『情緒通』18111過去22個月的運作經驗，並回應市民不同需求，為『情緒通』新增四項功能，以期為市民提供更貼心、更便捷、更全面的情緒支援。假如市民有情緒困擾或精神健康需要，我鼓勵大家致電『情緒通』尋求適切支援。『情緒通』將一如既往，『陪你傾，聽你講』。」

「情緒通」18111熱線四項新增功能如下：

（一）WhatsApp支援
為配合市民現代通訊習慣，熱線新增WhatsApp支援服務，讓市民即時發送信息至「情緒通」18111，並由受訓人員即時提供在線支援。這項功能不僅適合年輕人及對致電感到猶豫或不便的求助者，亦有助聽障或言語困難的市民更便捷地尋求協助，令服務更靈活和通達。

（二）多語言支援
「情緒通」新增至支援12種語言，除了原有的粵語、普通話和英語，亦支援印地語、尼泊爾語、烏爾都語、旁遮普語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、孟加拉語和泰語共九種少數族裔語言，提升服務可及性，讓更多使用不同語言的市民均能獲得所需支援。

（三）預約通話
市民可透過電話、語音信箱或WhatsApp提前預約合適的通話時間，由受訓人員在約定時間聯絡市民，提供更靈活、更貼心的精神健康支援。

（四）額外自選服務
市民除了可與熱線人員傾談外，亦可選擇透過語音導航或WhatsApp獲取支援服務資料和壓力管理技巧指導，或聆聽精神復元人士分享他們應對困境方法和尋求幫助經歷的生命故事（真人圖書館）。這項服務讓市民即時獲得其他支援服務資料和紓緩情緒的建議。

盧寵茂教授感謝精神健康諮詢委員會，以及所有推動精神健康服務的機構和持份者。他說：「精神健康不僅是個人的事，更是社會的責任。我深信憑藉政府、社會各界和家庭的共同努力，香港必定能成為一個更加關愛及注重精神健康的社會。」

同為啓動禮主禮的精神健康諮詢委員會主席林正財醫生說：「精神健康是社會幸福感的重要基石，我期望每一位有需要的市民都能『有門可敲』，並感受到關懷和支持。『情緒通』18111的新功能回應市民不同需求，標誌着精神健康支援服務進一步提升。我希望藉此將支援服務延伸到更多角落，為市民提供更多元化、更靈活的支援選擇。」

「我們總結『情緒通』18111過去22個月的運作經驗，並回應市民不同需求，為『情緒通』新增四項功能，以期為市民提供更貼心、更便捷、更全面的情緒支援。假如市民有情緒困擾或精神健康需要，我鼓勵大家致電『情緒通』尋求適切支援。『情緒通』將一如既往，『陪你傾，聽你講』。」

「情緒通」18111熱線四項新增功能如下：

（一）WhatsApp支援
為配合市民現代通訊習慣，熱線新增WhatsApp支援服務，讓市民即時發送信息至「情緒通」18111，並由受訓人員即時提供在線支援。這項功能不僅適合年輕人及對致電感到猶豫或不便的求助者，亦有助聽障或言語困難的市民更便捷地尋求協助，令服務更靈活和通達。

（二）多語言支援
「情緒通」新增至支援12種語言，除了原有的粵語、普通話和英語，亦支援印地語、尼泊爾語、烏爾都語、旁遮普語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、孟加拉語和泰語共九種少數族裔語言，提升服務可及性，讓更多使用不同語言的市民均能獲得所需支援。

（三）預約通話
市民可透過電話、語音信箱或WhatsApp提前預約合適的通話時間，由受訓人員在約定時間聯絡市民，提供更靈活、更貼心的精神健康支援。

（四）額外自選服務
市民除了可與熱線人員傾談外，亦可選擇透過語音導航或WhatsApp獲取支援服務資料和壓力管理技巧指導，或聆聽精神復元人士分享他們應對困境方法和尋求幫助經歷的生命故事（真人圖書館）。這項服務讓市民即時獲得其他支援服務資料和紓緩情緒的建議。

盧寵茂教授感謝精神健康諮詢委員會，以及所有推動精神健康服務的機構和持份者。他說：「精神健康不僅是個人的事，更是社會的責任。我深信憑藉政府、社會各界和家庭的共同努力，香港必定能成為一個更加關愛及注重精神健康的社會。」

陳錦榮主席（消費者委員會（消委會）主席）、各位嘉賓、各位新聞界朋友：

大家好。我非常榮幸，亦很高興今日出席由消委會舉辦的第二十五屆消費權益新聞報道獎頒獎禮，表揚本年度與消費權益有關的優秀報道。

剛才我在場外欣賞了很多卓越的得獎作品。正如主席提到，今屆「年度主題大獎」的主題是「無疆界消費的權益」，而當中的參賽作品涵蓋跨境消費、電子支付風險、可持續消費等題材。隨着虛擬平台、電子支付、虛擬貨幣和人工智能的普及，消費模式已突破地域和實體的界限，消費保障也必須與時並進。

就上述提及的新興領域和產業，政府一直緊貼市場最新趨勢，尋求多元經濟發展。其中，政府積極發展數字經濟及推動跨境電子商貿，加強與各地經貿夥伴的合作，協助香港企業開拓不同市場，拓展業務。同時，政府亦大力支持企業數碼升級轉型，從而更準確掌握消費者因應新消費模式而衍生的需求，提升競爭力。

在發展經濟的同時，我們必須確保消費者權益受到保障。我很高興消委會在這方面一直以來為香港市民把關。其中，消委會一直透過進行恆常產品測試、服務實試、市場調查及研究，為廣大消費者提供合時資訊，引導他們做個精明的消費者。

剛才主席亦提到銀髮經濟的挑戰和機遇，我很高興見到消委會積極配合促進銀髮經濟工作組推行的措施，包括透過《選擇》月刊及「智齡生活」專頁，持續發放與銀髮族息息相關的信息，強化「銀色消費」的資訊。我亦樂見消委會成立銀髮經濟諮詢小組，督導推展保障年長消費者權益的工作。下一屆的「年度主題大獎」的主題亦將聚焦於保障銀髮世代的消費權益，這不僅回應人口老化的社會趨勢，更突顯長者消費保障在政策及市場發展中的重要性。

當然，要令政府和消委會在推動保障消費者權益的工作發揮最大效用，傳媒朋友的角色至關重要。在座各位透過專業和客觀的報道，深入探討與消費者相關的議題，不但為香港廣大市民「長知識」，亦有助公眾加強自我保護意識，對維護市場信心發揮關鍵作用。

我在此衷心祝賀所有得獎者，各位傳媒朋友和參賽者的付出和努力，實在值得嘉許。我希望在座各位來年再接再厲，繼續撰寫高質素的報道，亦鼓勵其他傳媒朋友和大專院校的學生積極參與新聞報道獎。我希望透過大家積極參與，推動業界可持續發展。

最後，十二月七日是立法會選舉的大日子，大家緊記履行公民責任，投下你手中寶貴的一票，並鼓勵家人朋友踴躍投票，選出為香港繁榮穩定作出貢獻的立法會議員。十二月七日，投入選舉，共創未來！多謝大家。"

研討會邀請兩位來自英國蘇格蘭海洋科學研究所的浮游藻類專家主講。他們向與會者講解PCII相關理論與操作，以及相關生物性指數和評價方法在國際上（如歐盟地區）的最新發展和應用。出席研討會的內地代表分別來自生態環境部國家海洋環境監測中心、世界可持續發展科學院、廣東省生態環境廳和深圳市生態環境局；香港方面的出席者則包括環保署、漁農自然護理署、香港科技大學、香港城市大學、香港都會大學等政府部門和科硏機構的代表。

PCII透過分析營養鹽水平對海洋生態系統中浮游藻類群落的實質影響，以客觀亦具科學根據的方法有效評估沿岸水域富營養化狀況。PCII能在生態或生物性反應的關鍵指標上補充現有營養物水質指標，優化沿岸或河口區水域富營養化風險的評估，提升治理富營養化的成本效益，以期達致精準治污、科學治污。環保署已經應用PCII評估本港海域富營養化狀況，關於PCII的詳情及監測數據資料，請參閱環保署的專題網頁（https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/tc_chi/environmentinhk/water/hkwqrc/waterquality/phy_mon.html）及《2024年香港海水水質》年報（https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/sites/default/files/epd/tc_chi/environmentinhk/water/hkwqrc/files/waterquality/annual-report/marinereport2024.pdf）。"
EPD holds International Conference and Workshop on Phytoplankton Community Integrity Index (with photos),2025-11-04 12:35,2025-11-04 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400300.htm,"âThe Environmental Protection Department (EPD) is holding the International Conference and Workshop on Phytoplankton Community Integrity Index (PCII) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) from today (November 4) to November 6. The event aims to introduce the developments and applications of the PCII, provide training, and strengthen technical exchange and collaboration among professional bodies in this field from Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and overseas.

The EPD, drawing on the latest international practices, has successfully developed a biological indicator, the PCII, to address and manage nutrient enrichment in coastal and estuarine waters. The developments and applications of the PCII and the associated study findings were reviewed by academic scholars and published in an international scientific journal in February 2024.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, the Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, highlighted that the Conference aims to create a platform for sharing and promoting the latest developments and applications of the PCII and other relevant biological indicators, so as to provide useful reference for the future development of ecologically based assessment methods on evaluating eutrophication risks and assessing ecological impacts, and to further enhance co-operation between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Chinese Mainland in marine ecological environment protection, in order to achieve the target of jointly building the Greater Bay Area into a world-class beautiful bay area.

Two phytoplankton experts from the Scottish Association for Marine Science in the United Kingdom were invited to present on the theory and operation mechanism of the PCII, as well as the relevant biological indices and evaluation approaches recently developed and applied internationally (e.g. in the European Union). Chinese Mainland representatives in attendance came from the National Marine Environmental Monitoring Center of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, the World Sustainable Development Institute, the Department of Ecology and Environment of Guangdong Province, and the Ecology Environment Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality. Participants from Hong Kong included representatives from government officials and academic sectors such as the EPD, the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department, the HKUST, the City University of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Metropolitan University.

The PCII provides an objective and scientific assessment on coastal eutrophication as it analyses the impact of nutrient levels on phytoplankton communities in marine ecosystems. The PCII can be used to supplement traditional nutrient water quality standards with key indicators of ecological or biological responses, thus improving the assessment of eutrophication risks in coastal and estuarine waters and better promoting pollution control in a precise and scientific manner. This enhances the cost-effectiveness of managing eutrophication. The EPD has already adopted the PCII to assess the eutrophication status of marine waters. For more information on the PCII and relevant monitoring data, please refer to the EPD's dedicated website (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/water/hkwqrc/waterquality/phy_mon.html) and the annual report on Marine Water Quality Report in Hong Kong in 2024 (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/sites/default/files/epd/english/environmentinhk/water/hkwqrc/files/waterquality/annual-report/marinereport2024.pdf)."
Speech by STL at Super Terminal Expo 2025 (English only),2025-11-04 12:16,2025-11-04 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400312.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Super Terminal Expo 2025 today (November 4):

Fred (Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam), Ms Zhang (Director General of Department of Development Planning of Civil Aviation Administration of China, Ms Zhang Qing), Margaret (President and Chief Executive Officer of Informa Markets in Asia, Ms Margaret Ma Connolly), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. A very warm welcome to Super Terminal Expo2025.

It is my great pleasure to see so many distinguished guests, leaders and professionals from across the global aviation sector, gathering here to explore a very important theme, ""Shaping Asia's Future Transportation Hubs"". Located right in the middle of Asia and as the premier gateway for passengers and goods of the Chinese Mainland, the world's second-largest economy, Hong Kong is truly the perfect backdrop for this discussion today. With the commissioning of the Three-Runway System (3RS) of the Hong Kong International Airport last year, we are not just expanding our capacity; we are strengthening a vital bridge for global connectivity, entering an era of unprecedented growth and global partnership.

  An extensive aviation network is the key to our success as the major transportation hub in the region. We have been joining hands with the Airport Authority Hong Kong to accelerate the expansion of the aviation network through strategically attracting both local and non-local airlines to add new destinations and increase flight frequencies. We are also taking the initiative to visit aviation partners to discuss the establishment of new air services agreements, in order to expand the traffic rights and to relax the restrictions under those agreements. You can really see how determined we are when you look at what we have accomplished. Over the past two years, we have expanded bilateral air services agreements with more than 10 economies. Just the past two months, we have managed to strike deals with Chile and Poland to work on new air services agreements that will boost our connections to South America and Europe.

Meanwhile, we have also been strengthening our intermodal connectivity with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), which is home to 86 million people. On the passenger side, the Airport Authority is committed to expanding the city terminal network in the Chinese Mainland and working with Zhuhai Airport to improve the ""Fly-Via-Zhuhai-Hong Kong"" service. To draw more transit passengers from the GBA, the Government has just broadened the scope of Air Passenger Departure Tax exemptions to cover more passengers who travel to Hong Kong for transit by sea or land. On top of that, with our exciting SKYTOPIA development plan, which aims to transform the airport into a world-leading landmark for commerce, tourism, arts and leisure, we are set to attract even more passengers to the Airport Island. This will further solidify our position as the premier transit hub in the region.

Hong Kong is one of the few airports where both passenger and cargo flows are among the top in the world; our airport's competitive advantage is especially prominent as we won the title of the world's busiest cargo airport 14 times in the last 15 years. That is such an amazing achievement, thanks to the efforts of all colleagues working in the airport community. To strengthen its position, the Airport Authority is not only looking to take advantage of the 3RS to boost cargo throughput, but is also developing the sea-air transshipment mode and pressing ahead with the construction of a permanent logistics park in Dongguan. With the Phase 1 development of the logistics park be completed in stages starting from next month, this transshipment mode will help boost the use of Hong Kong air cargo services for transporting goods to and from the Chinese Mainland, addressing the rising demand for international cargo transport services in the GBA.

Our vision for creating a world-class transportation hub goes beyond traditional ways of travel. We are diving into a new era and new frontier of mobility - the low-altitude economy (LAE), which is one of the key discussion topics in this Expo. On this front, the Government is pushing ahead to build a competitive LAE ecosystem and propelling Hong Kong as an Asia-Pacific hub for innovative low-altitude economy development. Following the first batch of Regulatory Sandbox pilot projects we announced in March, we are now moving fast to the next stage. We are looking into the possibility of putting some of the more developed application scenarios into real-life applications. We are also facilitating various enterprises and companies to commercialise the application of the more advanced and more mature LAE applications. We will launch an advanced ""Regulatory Sandbox X"" to tackle more complex scenarios like cross-boundary routes and passenger-carrying low-altitude aircraft. The Working Group on Developing Low-altitude Economy, set up under the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, will also formulate the Action Plan on Developing Low-Altitude Economy. We eagerly await your valuable insights at the upcoming LAE forum to help guide our efforts which focus on three fronts. Firstly, we hope to facilitate the development of the more mature and more advanced technology of LAE in Hong Kong. Secondly, we are working on cross-boundary applications including logistics, to facilitate enterprises to trial different technologies and put them into commercial use. Last but not least, the setting of LAE standards. Hong Kong has been the pioneer of standard setting in civil aviation, and we also hope to do the same in LAE.

Ladies and gentlemen, the stage is now set, and we will collectively shape the future of Asia's intermodal hubs through groundbreaking dialogue and innovation over these three days. Please don’t hesitate to join us by taking part in the panel discussions and forums, and to really connect with each other so as to break through and to innovate. Let me thank Informa Markets for bringing this exceptional event to Hong Kong once again, and a big thank you to the Airport Authority for their incredible work in helping Hong Kong remain a leading transportation hub. I wish you all a very rewarding Expo, and a wonderful stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."
Speech by SCED at Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 (English only),2025-11-04 11:32,2025-11-04 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400287.htm," Following is the speech bythe Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, at the Hong Kong FinTech Week x StartmeupHK Festival 2025 today (November 4):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. Welcome to day two of the Hong Kong FinTech Week and StartmeupHK Festival this year. It is my great honour to meet you all here today.

 The StartmeupHK is an initiative launched in 2015 that assists start-ups from outside Hong Kong in setting up or expanding here. Under this initiative, Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) has been nurturing our local start-up ecosystem by connecting stakeholders and cultivating a start-up-friendly business environment. The most notable part of the initiative is the annual flagship event StartmeupHK Festival today.

 Time really flies, and this year marks the 10th anniversary of the StartmeupHK Festival, which has become an international brand of Hong Kong for start-ups. This year, we have taken an innovative step to amplify the momentum of this Festival by uniting the StartmeupHK Festival with another flagship event, namely, FinTech Week, on one single integrated platform. It is not just about celebrating the 10th anniversary of InvestHK's efforts in hosting mega events, but also for better demonstration of the convergence of fintech and frontier technologies like AI, healthtech and Web3. It creates more cross-sectoral opportunities for start-ups to connect with industry leaders and investors from all over the world in one single event.

 For more established companies and corporates, you will see the latest cutting-edge technologies and key discussions on important tech issues, and could network directly with some of the brightest start-ups from around the world to explore collaboration and business development.

 Hong Kong, being an ideal gateway connecting East and West, is renowned for its world-class infrastructure, a robust common law legal framework, a dynamic financial ecosystem, etc. Ranked as the world's freest economy, Hong Kong offers a transparent, efficient and accessible business environment - pillars that have sustained Hong Kong's long-term success. These distinctive advantages are attributed to our unique ""one country, two systems"", as we enjoy the strong support from the Chinese Mainland while staying open and connected to global markets. This has guaranteed that our city is the only one on Earth that carries both the global and China advantages. Looking ahead, the new eighth-term Legislative Council, which will be returned by the election to be held on December 7, would be a further testimony of the steadfast and successful implementation of ""one country, two systems"" as well as the good governance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This would further enhance Hong Kong's position as an international trade centre.

 Thanks to these unparalleled strengths, Hong Kong has attracted numerous companies from the world to establish a presence here. According to the latest survey, Hong Kong is home to a record high of around 10 000 non-local companies, including about 1 400 regional headquarters, many of which are tech firms and start-ups.

 Zooming in on our start-up ecosystem today, Hong Kong is not only a hub for financial innovation, but also a launch pad for breakthroughs of all innovation sectors, covering edutech, e-commerce, logistics technology, robotics, data analytics, greentech, etc. The city's entrepreneurial spirit, global connectivity and cross-border synergies make it a fertile ground for innovative ideas to grow and industries to transform.

 Our commitment to promoting innovation and technology is more than words, as it is clearly reflected in measurable growth of the local start-up ecosystem. The number of start-ups in Hong Kong has nearly tripled, from about 1 600 start-ups before the launch of the StartmeupHK initiative 10 years ago to around 4 700 last year, a record high with a year-on-year increase by 10 per cent. Besides, the start-up founder base is highly international, with nearly 30 per cent being non-local founders from origins like the Chinese Mainland, the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Australia, etc.

 Hong Kong's fintech ecosystem also stands out globally, ranking top for fintech offerings according to the 2025 Global Financial Centres Index, reflecting its leading role in innovation, strong regulatory framework and vibrant market with over 1 200 fintech companies driving cutting-edge solutions across wealthtech, blockchain, digital assets and payments.

 The impressive international ranking reflects that the Government is on the right track in supporting start-ups.

 As reflected in the Chief Executive's latest Policy Address, the Government continues to enhance Hong Kong's business-friendly environment for nurturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. For example, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau has introduced the Economic and Trade Express through synergising the efforts of our overseas offices with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and InvestHK to support local SMEs and start-ups to explore business opportunities in overseas markets.

 To deepen Hong Kong's international exchanges and co-operation amid the shifting geopolitical situation, we will expand the network and coverage of our overseas economic and trade offices (ETOs) to cover Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The new ETO is expected to commence operation by end of this year.

 To better support Mainland enterprises planning to set up overseas businesses by leveraging Hong Kong's professional services, we have just launched the brand new cross-bureau and cross-sectoral Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global last month to provide them with one-stop customised services.

 On intellectual property (IP), we will assist innovative companies in leveraging IPs for financing to enhance the IP trade ecosystem. This includes launching an IP financing sandbox pilot project, providing patent evaluation for companies, etc.

 Apart from the above new initiatives, there are also other supportive measures in place, such as the enhanced Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement Agreement, the new company re-domiciliation regime, various SME funding schemes, as well as tax concessions.

 Hong Kong is a highly stable and predictable economy for your investment during times of global economic uncertainties. More importantly, our long history of entrepreneurial spirit creates the perfect environment for bold ideas to take flight.

 As we gather this week, I encourage you to seize the valuable opportunities in our unified innovation platform, explore the diverse fora, engage in InvestHK's Global Fast Track programme for start-ups and connect with international business delegations. I am sure that our start-up friends from different sectors today would all find Hong Kong an ideal destination for business expansion.

 If you are interested in Hong Kong's business opportunities, InvestHK, our investment promotion agency, will provide you with one-on-one customised support to help you set up or expand your businesses here. From planning through implementation, my colleagues at InvestHK are always ready to assist.

 Ten years ago, we embarked a bold journey to build, connect and scale an innovation economy by launching the StartmeupHK Festival and FinTech Week. Looking forward, please continue to join hands with InvestHK to accelerate innovation by turning ideas into pilots, and pilots into scalable production in our vibrant city.

 Thank you."

Honourable Executive Deputy Director Xu Qifang (Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Honourable Deputy Governor Lu Lei (Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China), Honourable Vice Minister Zhou Liang (Vice Minister of the National Financial Regulatory Administration), Honourable Vice Chairman Li Ming (Vice Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission), Honourable Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR), Mr Eddie Yue (Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, to the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, now in its fourth annual edition.

  I still remember that when I addressed the inaugural Summit in 2022, a time when the world was emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, I said the event showed that Hong Kong was onstage again.

  Three years on, I'm proud to say that Hong Kong now shines on the global stage, radiating prosperity, confidence and much-needed reassurance.

  Don't just take my word for it. In September, the Canadian-based Fraser Institute ranked Hong Kong as the freest economy in the world – that's No.1 in economic freedom. Also this September, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD), in its World Talent Ranking, rated us fourth in the world and first in Asia – our highest-ever ranking in the report.

  Still with the IMD, Hong Kong finished third in its World Competitiveness Yearbook this year, up two places from 2024. And in the Global Financial Centres Index, we placed third in the world, just one point back of London, and two behind New York.

  Ladies and gentlemen, you're here, some 300 global financial leaders from all over the world, including more than 100 group chairpersons and CEOs, to see Hong Kong for yourselves. You're here, too, to get the latest financial and investment insight and intelligence, from the Summit's high-profile speakers, and to network with a world of like-minded aficionados of finance.

  I'm sure you enjoyed last night's Welcome Dinner at the Hong Kong Palace Museum, where East meets West in a dazzling integration of modern architecture and traditional Chinese cultural elements. Because more than global rankings, Hong Kong also dazzles with cultural diversity.

  The theme of this 2025 Summit, ""Trekking through Shifting Terrain"", resonates with yet another facet of Hong Kong's inimitable appeal. I'm talking about our remarkable network of prized hiking trails. You can explore them in our 25 country parks, covering about 40 per cent of Hong Kong's total land area. Waiting for you, and your hiking boots.

  Trekking through trails, marked and unmarked, shares a good many similarities with what financial leaders – all of you here today – face every day in this time of geopolitical uncertainty, market volatility and headlong technological advance.

  I'm here to tell you that there's firm footing in Hong Kong, your steadfast partner. We offer certainty and clarity, together with confidence and opportunity, for global investors and businesses seeking to diversify their assets and minimise risks.

  For the next few minutes, allow me to put a spotlight on two elements of compelling interest to all of you here: our financial markets and fintech.

  Hong Kong's financial markets remain vibrant, despite the uncertain global outlook. Our stock market has soared over 30 per cent, year-to-date, while average daily turnover has exceeded 32 billion US Dollars, nearly double that of last year.

  In the first ten months of the year, Hong Kong recorded 80 initial public offerings, raising over 26 billion US Dollars. And that, I'm pleased to say, puts us No.1 in IPO(initial public offering) fundraising worldwide.

  To maintain the momentum, we're pressing ahead with reforms to the listing regime, enabling the financing of overseas companies, enhancing trading and risk management efficiency, and promoting the trading of stocks in Renminbi.

  In September, we published a Roadmap for the Development of Fixed Income and Currency Markets. It's designed to attract primary market issuance, boost secondary market liquidity, expand our offshore Renminbi business, and develop next-generation infrastructure.

  It will offer global investors more choices, as they seek to re-allocate assets, and help companies raise funds in these mutable times.

  Meanwhile, Hong Kong is poised to become the world's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre in the next few years. To fast track that development, we are enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single-family offices and carried interest, to make the sector all the more attractive.

  We are also pursuing new growth areas, including building an international gold trading market. That rides on the substantial global demand for gold as a hedging investment product and reserve asset.

  Then there's financial technology. Blockchain and artificial intelligence are reshaping financial markets at an unprecedented pace. They can bring tangible benefits to financial markets and the real economy, enhancing efficiency and reducing transaction costs.

  Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 fintech companies. In September's Global Financial Centres Index, we ranked No. 1, globally, in fintech.

  No surprise to the 37 000 professionals here from more than 100 economies, for Hong Kong Fintech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival, which opened yesterday. It is, by the way, the 10th anniversary editions of both international gatherings, drawing in fintech and startup enthusiasts to our enterprising city.

  In June, we published our second policy statement on digital asset development, a refreshed take on our determination to establish Hong Kong as a global hub for digital assets.

  We are working with our regulators on a future-proof regulatory regime, key to enabling the healthy and sustainable development of digital assets in Hong Kong.

  Licensing aside, our sandboxes allow promising fintech applications to be tested in controlled environments. Among them, Project Ensemble explores the tokenisation of assets, and the development of common industry standards.

  The Monetary Authority will promote live transactions of tokenised assets, exploring tokenisation's potential in digital trade and other areas.

  Trekking through shifting terrain is not a recommended solitary behaviour, for companies or for economies. It's why I'm grateful for the continuing support of market leaders – of all of you here today.

  Hong Kong was built on reaching out, on seeking international partnerships and mutual opportunities. Our unique ""one country, two systems"" framework enables that, allowing Hong Kong to reach out to a world of prospects, while maintaining unparalleled access to China, our country.

  I've just returned, this Sunday, from Korea for the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. There, I had the pleasure of representing Hong Kong, China, a full and separate member of APEC, and meeting and working with leaders from a world of economies, to advance the important cause of open trade and multilateralism.

  Later today, I will depart for Shanghai to attend the China International Import Expo. Also joining the Expo will be 380 Hong Kong companies, which will promote their products and services, and put a bright spotlight on the Hong Kong brand.

  The Shanghai trip will also mark the first major promotional event by the newly established GoGlobal Task Force. The Task Force will make it easy for Mainland companies to find foreign markets and global capital, as the world looks to our country for its quality products and services.

  In finance, the term ""leverage"" refers to the use of borrowed funds for further investments. Here in Hong Kong, we leverage more than funds. We leverage our financial prowess for the benefit of investors, economies and, importantly, humanity.

  I'm pleased to note that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) announced, just yesterday, that it will set up an office in Hong Kong. The AIIB is a multilateral development bank that supports developing countries in infrastructure improvements.

  As a committed member of the AIIB, Hong Kong will do all we can to support its establishment of an office here. That includes leveraging our vibrant capital markets, world-class professional services, and diversified products. We will also help the AIIB in project financing, bond issuance, investment management, and much more.

  These examples, ladies and gentlemen, are more than business missions, meeting dignitaries and commercial operations. They are ""one country, two systems"" hard at work. They are shining examples of how the principle – how Hong Kong – helps connect the world with the Chinese market.

  My thanks to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, this Summit's main organiser, and to each and every one of you for your invaluable presence.

  When you're here, do make the most of all that Hong Kong has to offer. That includes the scenic hiking trails I've mentioned. That also includes this very hotel we're at, which I'm glad to say has just been crowned No.1 in the World's 50 Best Hotels ranking. And our many Michelin-starred restaurants and award-winning bars – one of which came first in the World's 50 Best Bars last month, recognised as the world's best bar.

  Asia's best, world's best – all here for you to experience. To eat, drink, sleep, and spend some good time in. Some good money in!

  On that note, I wish you a rewarding Summit, an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, and the best of business and investment in the coming year.

  Thank you."

  It will offer global investors more choices, as they seek to re-allocate assets, and help companies raise funds in these mutable times.

  Meanwhile, Hong Kong is poised to become the world's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre in the next few years. To fast track that development, we are enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single-family offices and carried interest, to make the sector all the more attractive.

  We are also pursuing new growth areas, including building an international gold trading market. That rides on the substantial global demand for gold as a hedging investment product and reserve asset.

  Then there's financial technology. Blockchain and artificial intelligence are reshaping financial markets at an unprecedented pace. They can bring tangible benefits to financial markets and the real economy, enhancing efficiency and reducing transaction costs.

  Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 fintech companies. In September's Global Financial Centres Index, we ranked No. 1, globally, in fintech.

  No surprise to the 37 000 professionals here from more than 100 economies, for Hong Kong Fintech Week and the StartmeupHK Festival, which opened yesterday. It is, by the way, the 10th anniversary editions of both international gatherings, drawing in fintech and startup enthusiasts to our enterprising city.

  In June, we published our second policy statement on digital asset development, a refreshed take on our determination to establish Hong Kong as a global hub for digital assets.

  We are working with our regulators on a future-proof regulatory regime, key to enabling the healthy and sustainable development of digital assets in Hong Kong.

  Licensing aside, our sandboxes allow promising fintech applications to be tested in controlled environments. Among them, Project Ensemble explores the tokenisation of assets, and the development of common industry standards.

  The Monetary Authority will promote live transactions of tokenised assets, exploring tokenisation's potential in digital trade and other areas.

  Trekking through shifting terrain is not a recommended solitary behaviour, for companies or for economies. It's why I'm grateful for the continuing support of market leaders – of all of you here today.

  Hong Kong was built on reaching out, on seeking international partnerships and mutual opportunities. Our unique ""one country, two systems"" framework enables that, allowing Hong Kong to reach out to a world of prospects, while maintaining unparalleled access to China, our country.

  I've just returned, this Sunday, from Korea for the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. There, I had the pleasure of representing Hong Kong, China, a full and separate member of APEC, and meeting and working with leaders from a world of economies, to advance the important cause of open trade and multilateralism.

  Later today, I will depart for Shanghai to attend the China International Import Expo. Also joining the Expo will be 380 Hong Kong companies, which will promote their products and services, and put a bright spotlight on the Hong Kong brand.

  The Shanghai trip will also mark the first major promotional event by the newly established GoGlobal Task Force. The Task Force will make it easy for Mainland companies to find foreign markets and global capital, as the world looks to our country for its quality products and services.

  In finance, the term ""leverage"" refers to the use of borrowed funds for further investments. Here in Hong Kong, we leverage more than funds. We leverage our financial prowess for the benefit of investors, economies and, importantly, humanity.

  I'm pleased to note that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) announced, just yesterday, that it will set up an office in Hong Kong. The AIIB is a multilateral development bank that supports developing countries in infrastructure improvements.

  As a committed member of the AIIB, Hong Kong will do all we can to support its establishment of an office here. That includes leveraging our vibrant capital markets, world-class professional services, and diversified products. We will also help the AIIB in project financing, bond issuance, investment management, and much more.

  These examples, ladies and gentlemen, are more than business missions, meeting dignitaries and commercial operations. They are ""one country, two systems"" hard at work. They are shining examples of how the principle – how Hong Kong – helps connect the world with the Chinese market.

  My thanks to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, this Summit's main organiser, and to each and every one of you for your invaluable presence.

  When you're here, do make the most of all that Hong Kong has to offer. That includes the scenic hiking trails I've mentioned. That also includes this very hotel we're at, which I'm glad to say has just been crowned No.1 in the World's 50 Best Hotels ranking. And our many Michelin-starred restaurants and award-winning bars – one of which came first in the World's 50 Best Bars last month, recognised as the world's best bar.

  Asia's best, world's best – all here for you to experience. To eat, drink, sleep, and spend some good time in. Some good money in!

  On that note, I wish you a rewarding Summit, an enjoyable stay in Hong Kong, and the best of business and investment in the coming year.

  Thank you."
Speech by CE at Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit (English only),2025-11-04 10:09,2025-11-04 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400232.htm,"Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit today (November 4):

Honourable Executive Deputy Director Xu Qifang (Executive Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Honourable Deputy Governor Lu Lei (Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China), Honourable Vice Minister Zhou Liang (Vice Minister of the National Financial Regulatory Administration), Honourable Vice Chairman Li Ming (Vice Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission), Honourable Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR), Mr Eddie Yue (Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, to the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, now in its fourth annual edition.

  I still remember that when I addressed the inaugural Summit in 2022, a time when the world was emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, I said the event showed that Hong Kong was onstage again.

  Three years on, I'm proud to say that Hong Kong now shines on the global stage, radiating prosperity, confidence and much-needed reassurance.

  Don't just take my word for it. In September, the Canadian-based Fraser Institute ranked Hong Kong as the freest economy in the world – that's No.1 in economic freedom. Also this September, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD), in its World Talent Ranking, rated us fourth in the world and first in Asia – our highest-ever ranking in the report.

  Still with the IMD, Hong Kong finished third in its World Competitiveness Yearbook this year, up two places from 2024. And in the Global Financial Centres Index, we placed third in the world, just one point back of London, and two behind New York.

  Ladies and gentlemen, you're here, some 300 global financial leaders from all over the world, including more than 100 group chairpersons and CEOs, to see Hong Kong for yourselves. You're here, too, to get the latest financial and investment insight and intelligence, from the Summit's high-profile speakers, and to network with a world of like-minded aficionados of finance.

  I'm sure you enjoyed last night's Welcome Dinner at the Hong Kong Palace Museum, where East meets West in a dazzling integration of modern architecture and traditional Chinese cultural elements. Because more than global rankings, Hong Kong also dazzles with cultural diversity.

  The theme of this 2025 Summit, ""Trekking through Shifting Terrain"", resonates with yet another facet of Hong Kong's inimitable appeal. I'm talking about our remarkable network of prized hiking trails. You can explore them in our 25 country parks, covering about 40 per cent of Hong Kong's total land area. Waiting for you, and your hiking boots.

  Trekking through trails, marked and unmarked, shares a good many similarities with what financial leaders – all of you here today – face every day in this time of geopolitical uncertainty, market volatility and headlong technological advance.

  I'm here to tell you that there's firm footing in Hong Kong, your steadfast partner. We offer certainty and clarity, together with confidence and opportunity, for global investors and businesses seeking to diversify their assets and minimise risks.

  For the next few minutes, allow me to put a spotlight on two elements of compelling interest to all of you here: our financial markets and fintech.

  Hong Kong's financial markets remain vibrant, despite the uncertain global outlook. Our stock market has soared over 30 per cent, year-to-date, while average daily turnover has exceeded 32 billion US Dollars, nearly double that of last year.

  In the first ten months of the year, Hong Kong recorded 80 initial public offerings, raising over 26 billion US Dollars. And that, I'm pleased to say, puts us No.1 in IPO(initial public offering) fundraising worldwide.

  To maintain the momentum, we're pressing ahead with reforms to the listing regime, enabling the financing of overseas companies, enhancing trading and risk management efficiency, and promoting the trading of stocks in Renminbi.

  In September, we published a Roadmap for the Development of Fixed Income and Currency Markets. It's designed to attract primary market issuance, boost secondary market liquidity, expand our offshore Renminbi business, and develop next-generation infrastructure.

  It will offer global investors more choices, as they seek to re-allocate assets, and help companies raise funds in these mutable times.

  Meanwhile, Hong Kong is poised to become the world's largest cross-boundary wealth management centre in the next few years.

Hong Kong rose to rank fourth globally in digital competitiveness,2025-11-04 09:01,2025-11-04 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/04/P2025110400203.htm,"  In the latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking (WDCR) 2025 published by the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), Hong Kong ranked fourth globally, up further by three places after rising by three places last year.

  Among the three factors in WDCR 2025, Hong Kong continued to perform well and remained third and fifth globally in ""Technology"" and ""Knowledge"" respectively, while our ranking in ""Future readiness"" improved notably by five places to tenth. At the sub-factor level, ""Technological framework"" and ""Adaptive attitudes"" ranked first globally. ""Talent"" and ""Training and education"" ranked among the top five globally.

  A Government spokesman said today (November 4), ""The IMD's WDCR 2025 continued to recognise Hong Kong as one of the most digitally competitive economies in the world. Our country supports Hong Kong to develop into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been striving to enhance the strategic layout of I&T infrastructure, with three major I&T parks and five key research and development (R&D) institutions as the framework, so as to actively drive I&T development and cultivate new quality productive forces. With the staunch support from our country and Hong Kong's international prospects, coupled with a thriving start-up ecosystem, a free, open and fair business environment, a simple low tax system and strong policy support, Hong Kong is well positioned to attract enterprises, talent and technology from around the world, thereby laying a solid foundation for further advancing the I&T collaboration and development.""

  The spokesman added, ""The Chief Executive announced in the 2025 Policy Address a series of measures aimed at implementing the development of the international I&T centre. To promote R&D, the Government is taking forward the set-up of two pilot lines by the Hong Kong Microelectronics Research and Development Institute, and will complete the preparatory work for the establishment of the Life and Health Technology Research Institute(s) and the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute within next year. To accelerate the development of 'new industrialisation', we will expedite the development of the third InnoHK research cluster, relax the application threshold for the 'New Industrialisation Acceleration Scheme' and launch the 'I&T Industry-Oriented Fund' in 2026-27. The Government will also continue to promote the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science industries, guided by the strategy of 'strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach', with a view to achieving 'industries for AI' and 'AI for industries'. On infrastructure, the computing power of Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre will be ramped up this year to meet the strong demand from sectors in Hong Kong, complemented by the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme that has been launched. The Government has also put up a site of about 10 hectares at Sandy Ridge in the North District for the development of a data facility cluster for open tender. On application, the HKSAR Government will continue promote AI business applications. Besides, the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone will commence operation this year, and the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole will also be published this year. Going forward, the HKSAR Government will continue to promote closer collaboration among the Government and the industry, academia, research and investment sectors, consolidate and enhance our competitive edge in the global market, as well as foster the cultivation of new quality productive forces."""
