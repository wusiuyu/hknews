"Government terminates all contracts associated with owners of Xin Ding Xin Trade Co., Limited",2025-08-20 23:52,2025-08-21 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/20/P2025082000801.htm,"âA Government spokesman said today (August 20) that the Government had immediately terminated all contracts associated with owners of Xin Ding Xin Trade Co., Limited (XDX).

Based on the information obtained by the Government Logistics Department (GLD) on the business operation of XDX earlier, as well as recent enforcement actions against XDX by government departments, the Government reasonably believes that XDX and companies associated with its owners (i.e. those sharing the same registered office with XDX and have directors including the director/shareholders of XDX) would no longer be capable of performing the contracts. Following GLD's termination of the contract with XDX for supply of bottled drinking water to government offices and three other contracts for supply of chemicals associated with its owners earlier, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau has also promptly informed bureaux and departments to terminate all of their contracts with the said companies.

The Government spokesman said today that the Government had immediately terminated all other contracts with those companies. They include a contract for the supply of chemicals awarded by the Drainage Services Department (DSD) and a contract for data entry services awarded by the Fire Services Department (FSD), with a total contract value of some $6 million and some $5 million respectively.

As regards the GLD's contract with XDX for the supply of bottled drinking water to government offices, XDX has submitted a deposit of about $1 million to the Government pursuant with contract terms. The Government is entitled to deduct from the contract deposit according to contract terms to recover its losses arising from contract termination, and reserves all rights to take actions against XDX. The GLD will also continue to be in full co-operation with the investigations of law enforcement agencies.

The GLD, DSD and FSD will continue to follow up seriously on the above contracts, including considering to recover the Government's losses from the relevant companies in accordance with contract terms. Any illegal activities identified in the contracts will be referred to law enforcement agencies for follow-up."
​政府終止所有與鑫鼎鑫負責人有關聯的合約,2025-08-20 23:25,2025-08-20 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/20/P2025082000784.htm,"政府發言人今日（八月二十日）表示，政府已即時終止所有與鑫鼎鑫商貿有限公司（鑫鼎鑫）負責人有關聯的合約。

基於政府物流服務署（物流署）早前取得鑫鼎鑫的營運資料，以及政府部門近日對鑫鼎鑫的執法行動，政府有理由相信鑫鼎鑫及與其負責人有關聯的公司（即與鑫鼎鑫使用同一註冊辦事處的公司，而該些公司的董事包括鑫鼎鑫的董事／股東）未能繼續履行合約。物流署早前已終止與鑫鼎鑫的政府辦公室樽裝飲用水合約及另外三張與其負責人有關聯的化學品合約，財經事務及庫務局亦隨即通知各政策局及部門終止其所有與該些公司的合約。

Government stresses that telehealth services should be provided by qualified healthcare professionals in accordance with professional guidelines,2025-08-20 21:58,2025-08-20 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/20/P2025082000633.htm," Regarding the Consumer Council's study findings on ""Enhancing Governance in Telehealth: Fostering Consumer Trust and Innovation"", the Health Bureau today (August 20) stated that to ensure healthcare quality and safety and to safeguard citizen’s health, the Government's long-standing position is that any kind of medical service (including in-person consultations or telehealth services) should be provided by qualified healthcare professionals, whose delivery is governed by the regulatory boards and councils of relevant healthcare professions. Such healthcare professionals bear professional responsibility and must act in the interest of patients. Their standard of practice must not be compromised based on the service mode (whether by means of in-person consultations or telehealth services).

 Currently, the Medical Council of Hong Kong and the Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board under the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong have already promulgated guidelines for the telehealth practice (see Annexes), covering operational issues such as establishing a doctor-patient relationship, evaluating patients' suitability for telehealth services, obtaining informed consent and protecting patient privacy.

 Telehealth services allow citizens to access healthcare services without leaving their homes; however, they may not be suitable for all scenarios particularly when patients may need on-site clinical examinations for accurate diagnosis and treatment. This involves the professional judgment of healthcare professionals. The Government will ensure that the boards and councils of various healthcare professions would formulate and update specific telehealth guidelines in a timely manner based on their professional practice and operational needs, with a view to protecting the interests of patients and healthcare professionals. When seeking medical services, members of the public should ascertain that the service provider is a qualified healthcare professional to safeguard their own safety and interests. In case of complaints against the telehealth services provided by healthcare professionals, the public may contact the regulatory boards and councils of relevant healthcare professions."
CHP investigates imported case of Japanese encephalitis,2025-08-20 21:38,2025-08-20 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/20/P2025082000722.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating today (August 20) an imported case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and urged the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures when travelling to JE endemic areas.

The case involves a 49-year-old female living in Shatin District. Initial investigations revealed that she travelled to the Philippines between July 21 and August 4, and visited rural areas there. She returned to Hong Kong on August 4 and developed fever, headache and vomiting since August 10. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales Hospital on August 12 but did not require hospitalisation. As her symptoms persisted, she attended the hospital again on August 14 and was admitted to the hospital. She is currently in stable condition.

Her cerebrospinal fluid sample tested positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against JE upon laboratory testing. Since the patient stayed in the Philippines during the incubation period, the CHP considered that she was infected during travel, and the case was classified as an imported one. Her four household contacts are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. The CHP's epidemiological investigations is ongoing and the case will be reported to the health authority of the Philippines.

This is the first JE case recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. In the past five years (from 2020 to 2024), no JE cases were recorded in Hong Kong.

JE is mainly transmitted by mosquito and the principal vector is Culex tritaeniorhynchus. It is not transmitted from person to person. Mosquitoes breed in areas where there is a lot of stagnant water, such as rice paddies, and become infected when they bite pigs or wild birds infected with the JE virus. The infected mosquitoes then transmit the virus to humans and animals during biting. JE is prevalent in rural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific Region, especially in hot season. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.

Symptoms usually start around four to 14 days after being infected. Most patients with JE have mild symptoms, with no significant symptoms other than fever and headache. However, approximately one in every 250 infections is associated with severe illnesses characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.

To prevent JE, the public should take general measures to prevent mosquito bites. Members of the public, especially those planning to travel to JE endemic areas, should take the following measures:

• Consult a doctor at least six weeks before travelling to JE endemic areas, and have extra preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites;
• Travellers planning to stay in JE endemic areas, particularly in rural areas, for one month or longer, or those planning to have significant extensive outdoor or night-time exposure in rural areas during the transmission season of the disease, may consult their family doctor and consider receiving JE vaccination;
• During travel in JE endemic rural areas, bring a portable bed net and apply permethrin (an insecticide) on it. Permethrin should not be applied directly to the skin. Seek medical attention promptly if feeling unwell; and
• Travellers feeling unwell, such as having a fever, should seek medical advice promptly, and provide travel details to the doctor.

The public may visit the CHP'sJE page,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, Travel Health Serviceand also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department for more information."
SEE visits Ministry of Ecology and Environment (with photos),2025-08-20 21:14,2025-08-20 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/20/P2025082000702.htm," The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, visited the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) and a charging infrastructure monitoring and service platform in Beijing today (August 20).

衞生防護中心調查日本腦炎輸入個案,2025-08-20 20:57,2025-08-20 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/20/P2025082000691.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月二十日）正調查一宗日本腦炎輸入個案，同時呼籲市民前往日本腦炎流行地區應採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施。

個案涉及一名居於沙田區的49歲女子。初步調查顯示，她於七月二十一日至八月四日曾到菲律賓，期間到過當地的郊區。她在八月四日回港，八月十日起出現發燒、頭痛及嘔吐，八月十二日到威爾斯親王醫院急症室求診，當時無需入院。因病情持續，她於八月十四日再到該院求診，獲安排入院，目前情況穩定。

她的腦脊液樣本經檢驗後，證實對日本腦炎免疫球蛋白M（IgM）抗體呈陽性反應。由於她潛伏期逗留在菲律賓，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。她的四名家居接觸者現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心正繼續流行病學調查，並會把個案通報菲律賓衞生當局。

這是本港今年錄得的首宗日本腦炎個案，屬輸入個案。過去五年（二○二○年至二四年），本港沒有錄得日本腦炎個案。

日本腦炎主要經蚊傳播，主要病媒是三帶喙庫蚊，不會人傳人。蚊子於稻田等大量積水地方繁殖，叮咬帶病毒的豬或野生雀鳥後就會受感染，再於叮咬人類或動物時將病毒傳播。日本腦炎主要流行於亞洲及西太平洋地區的郊外及農村，尤其在氣候炎熱的季節。在熱帶及亞熱帶地區，病毒傳播全年都可發生，高峰期通常為雨季。

 日本腦炎由受感染至發病約為四至14日。大部分日本腦炎病人均病情輕微，除發燒及頭痛外，一般不會有其他顯著病徵，但每二百五十宗感染中便大約有一宗會出現嚴重病情，病徵包括迅速出現高燒、頭痛、頸部僵硬、喪失方向知覺、昏迷、抽搐、痙攣性癱瘓，甚至死亡。

要預防日本腦炎，應採取防蚊措施，避免蚊叮。市民，特別是準備前往日本腦炎流行地區的人士，應採取以下措施：


在出發前往日本腦炎流行地區前至少六星期，徵詢醫生意見，採取額外預防措施，避免被蚊叮；
準備在日本腦炎流行地區（尤其是當地郊區）並逗留一個月或以上的人士，或計劃於疾病傳播季節到郊區並大部分時間進行戶外或夜間活動的人士，可諮詢家庭醫生意見，考慮接種日本腦炎疫苗；
如到日本腦炎流行地區的郊外，應帶備便攜式蚊帳，並在蚊帳上使用氯菊酯殺蟲劑。切勿將氯菊酯塗在皮膚。如感到不適，應盡早求醫；及
若感到不適，如發燒，應盡快求醫，並將行程細節告知醫生。

Among the sixth batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering two survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent, except the First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes for Kai Tak North in Kowloon City and Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan.

The FEHD has so far announced six batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 40 survey areas. Among these 40 survey areas, 24 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared with the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained at a low level. Eleven other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Among the sixth batch of indexes released, Kai Tak North in Kowloon City and Ma Wan in Tsuen Wan recorded an index over 10 per cent. In accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation, the FEHD is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, the gravidtrap data for Kai Tak North showed that the locations with more mosquito problems included public and private housing estates, while the gravidtrap data for Ma Wan showed that the locations with more mosquito problems included parks, beaches, schools, private housing estates and construction sites. The gravidtrap index for Ma Wan survey area dropped from 30.4 per cent in first phase to 24.4 per cent in July, and its First Phase Gravidtrap Index in August further dropped to 20 per cent. The relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up on the mosquito control work. Additionally, the FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共六批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共40個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這40個監察區中，有24個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有11區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

​至於第六批公布的指數高於10%的包括九龍城啟德北及荃灣馬灣，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排，食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。其中，啟德北誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公共屋邨及私人屋苑；至於馬灣誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、沙灘、學校、私人屋苑及建築工地，該監察地區七月份的誘蚊器指數由第一階段的30.4%回落至24.4%，八月份第一階段指數進一步下調至20%，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

​要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：


收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

​食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

大家好！非常榮幸出席《中國是不可征服的——中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭中的宋慶齡》圖片展開幕式暨招待會，與各位一同重溫歷史，緬懷革命先烈，傳承抗戰精神。

日本自19世紀末，屢次侵華，計有一八九四年的甲午戰爭、一八九五年侵佔台灣、一九○○年作為八國聯軍的主力軍侵入北京、一九○四年侵佔我國東北、一九一五年提出意欲將中國變成其殖民地的「二十一條」，到一九三一年策動「九一八事變」，成為中國人民抗日戰爭的起點。

在長達14年的抗日戰爭中，中華兒女為國家存亡而戰，前赴後繼，展現了天下興亡、匹夫有責的愛國情懷，寧死不屈的氣節，和血戰到底的英雄氣概，到最終迎來了勝利！中國人民抗日戰爭的勝利，是全民眾志成城、奮勇抗敵的偉大勝利，洗刷了近代抗擊外來侵略屢戰屢敗的民族恥辱，也開啟了中國人民浴火重生的歷史新征程！

今年是中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年。為彰顯抗戰勝利80周年的重要歷史意義，特區政府和社會各界積極組織多樣的紀念活動，讓香港市民回顧抗戰歷史，深入了解中國人民在抗戰中的犧牲，與抗戰先烈的英勇事跡。

宋慶齡女士傳奇的一生，與國家近百年的歷史發展緊密相連。這次展覽借助詳實的圖片資料，呈現宋女士的愛國熱忱及在抗戰期間的傑出貢獻，以此緬懷為民族獨立和解放事業建立不朽功勛的革命先輩。我在此感謝中國福利會精心策劃展覽，以及香港宋慶齡基金的大力支持，為香港市民，特別是青少年帶來一堂真實感人、鮮活生動的愛國教育課和歷史課，讓大家重溫這段可歌可泣的歷史，感受中華民族的堅毅精神，向捨身護國的愛國志士致敬。

為隆重紀念抗戰勝利80周年，文化體育及旅遊局以及康樂及文化事務署（康文署）策劃了一系列紀念活動，包括專題展覽、老戰士分享會和外展活動等，以弘揚先烈偉大的抗戰精神。康文署轄下的香港歷史博物館和香港抗戰及海防博物館，也分別與中國國家博物館及廣東革命歷史博物館合作，於下星期舉辦以抗戰為主題的展覽，透過珍貴的抗戰文物、歷史影像及多媒體節目等，還原波瀾壯闊的烽火歲月，展現抗戰期間香港市民與祖國同胞血脈相連、並肩作戰的深厚情誼，以弘揚愛國主義精神，進一步增強香港市民對國家和民族的認識和認同。

習近平主席在紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利75周年的座談會說：「前事不忘，後事之師。我們紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利，譴責侵略者的殘暴，強調牢記歷史經驗和教訓，不是要延續仇恨，而是要喚起善良的人們對和平的嚮往和堅守，是要以史為鑑、面向未來，共同珍愛和平、維護和平」。我誠摯邀請廣大市民前來參觀展覽及參與各項紀念活動，共同銘記抗戰歷史，並從中汲取奮進力量，繼續為實現中華民族偉大復興作出貢獻。

最後，我再次向中國福利會、香港宋慶齡基金以及支持這次展覽的各界人士致以衷心的謝意。我祝展覽圓滿成功，大家身體健康。謝謝大家。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-20 18:20,2025-08-20 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/20/P2025082000524.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心提醒市民應採取妥善防蚊和個人保護措施，特別是從蚊傳疾病流行地區回港後。若出現發燒或急性關節痛等病徵，應立即就醫並通知醫生相關旅遊史。

輸入個案的分析

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港今年累計錄得九宗輸入個案，涉及六男和三女，年齡介乎8至79歲（中位數：31歲），各個年齡組別人士均有機會受到感染。五宗病例在潛伏期內曾前往廣東省佛山市，四宗病例則曾前往孟加拉國。市民應留意現時除廣東省佛山外，全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，外遊前必須注意當地情況。三名病人在返港前已發病，另外六名病人在返港後第一至五天發病，因此從受影響地區返港後仍需繼續觀察身體狀況。病徵方面，所有病人均出現發燒，絕大部分（八宗）病例出現關節疼痛，通常在發燒開始的當天或一天後出現。最常受影響的部位包括手腕、肘部、膝蓋和腳踝。市民若從基孔肯雅熱流行地區返港後出現上述典型病徵，應立即求醫並告知外遊史，並應避免使用非類固醇消炎止痛藥（如布洛芬），以免加劇出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致『雷爾氏綜合症』，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「公共衞生化驗服務處的基因分析顯示佛山輸入的個案屬東／中／南非基因型的中非亞譜系，與廣東省現時流行的病毒株一樣。另外，孟加拉國輸入的個案屬東／中／南非基因型的印度洋亞譜系。上述兩種亞譜系帶有關鍵基因突變，增強病毒在白紋伊蚊中的適應性和傳播效率，從而加速了基孔肯雅病毒的傳播。中心的基因分析顯示白紋伊蚊可有效傳播現時流行的基孔肯雅病毒，輸入個案如在傳染期被蚊子叮咬，有機會導致本地傳播。因此，防蚊控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。科學研究顯示，即使沒有病徵或尚未出現病徵的感染者被蚊叮咬，亦有機會把病毒傳給蚊子。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續採取措施防止被蚊叮咬。」

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-20 18:20,2025-08-20 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/20/P2025082000525.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 20), no new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures, especially upon returning to Hong Kong from regions where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic. Individuals experiencing symptoms such as fever or acute joint pain should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors of their travel history.

Analysis of imported cases

""Hong Kong has recorded nine imported CF cases this year, involving six males and three females aged between 8 and 79 years (median age: 31). Individuals of all age groups are susceptible to infection. Five cases involved individuals who had travelled to Foshan in Guangdong Province during the incubation period, while four involved individuals who had travelled to Bangladesh. The public should be aware that, in addition to Foshan in Guangdong Province, many countries worldwide are currently experiencing CF outbreaks. It is essential to check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad. Three patients developed symptoms before returning to Hong Kong and the remaining six patients developed symptoms between the first and the fifth day after returning. Therefore, individuals returning from affected areas should continue to monitor their health. Regarding symptoms, all patients experienced fever, and the vast majority (eight cases) reported joint pain, which typically appeared on the same day or the day after the onset of fever. The most commonly affected areas were the wrists, elbows, knees and ankles. Members of the public who experience these typical symptoms after returning to Hong Kong from a region where CF is prevalent should seek medical attention immediately and inform their doctors of their travel history. The public should not self-medicate, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), to prevent aggravating the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

""Genetic analysis by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch indicated that an imported case from Foshan belonged to the Central African lineage of the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype, which is the same as the viral strain currently circulating in Guangdong. Meanwhile, imported cases from Bangladesh belonged to the Indian Ocean lineage of the ECSA genotype. These two sublineages carry key genetic mutations that enhance the virus's adaptability and transmission efficiency in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, thereby accelerating the spread of the CF virus. The CHP's genetic analysis showed that Aedes albopictus mosquitoes can effectively transmit the currently circulating CF virus. If imported cases are bitten by mosquitoes during the infectious period, there is a risk of local transmission. Therefore, mosquito prevention and control efforts are of the utmost importance. Whether in town or travelling abroad, it is important to maintain environmental hygiene, take mosquito prevention and control measures, and adopt personal protective measures. Scientific research indicates that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected individuals can transmit the CF virus to mosquitoes through bites. Residents returning to Hong Kong from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should continue to take measures to prevent mosquito bites for 14 days,"" he added.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the patients, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspectionof the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

Dr Edwin Tsui reminded members of the public to adopt precautions during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
