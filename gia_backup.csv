""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

Buildings Department takes enforcement action against illegal domestic units in industrial building,2025-07-04 22:51,2025-07-04 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400968.htm,"âRegarding the fire incident in an industrial building at 21 Ma Tau Wai Road, Hung Hom, yesterday (July 3), it was suspected that the unit concerned had been subdivided for illegal domestic use. The Buildings Department (BD) was very concerned about this matter, and launched an investigation immediately. If any unlawful act is found, the BD will consider instigating prosecution against the relevant persons.

  ""The design, approval of building plans and construction of industrial buildings are intended solely for industrial use. Since the units in industrial buildings are used for industrial activities, including the storage of dangerous and flammable items, illegal conversion of industrial buildings to domestic use poses serious safety risks to users. No one should reside in industrial buildings. Persons involved in sales and rental activities, such as prospective buyers and tenants as well as estate agents, should check the approved use of the units. An industrial unit should not be used for domestic purposes,"" a spokesman for the BD said.

Following the fire incident yesterday, the BD has deployed its staff to carry out a site inspection. Officers at the scene found that the unit concerned was subdivided into a number of smaller units, and some of them were illegally used for domestic purposes. The BD has served statutory orders in accordance with section 25 (2) and section 26(1) of the Buildings Ordinance (BO) to order the owner to discontinue the use of the unit for domestic purposes and rectify the dangerous situation. The BD will continue its investigation. If anyone is found in contravention of the BO, the BD will follow up seriously, including considering prosecution against the relevant persons. In addition, the BD will include the building in its large-scale operation against domestic use in industrial buildings and will arrange to inspect the other units of the building in phases.

Failure to comply with a discontinuation order served under section 25(2) or a repair order served under section 26(1) of the BO without reasonable excuse are serious offences. Upon conviction, the offender is liable to a maximum fine at level 5 (currently $50,000) and imprisonment for one year, and a further fine of $5,000 for each day that the offence continues.

To ascertain the approved use of the premises, apart from obtaining independent professional advice, members of the public may obtain relevant information by checking the occupation permit and approved building plans of the building via the Building Records Access and Viewing On-line system of the BD if they are in doubt.

The Government is finalising the proposals to amend the BO and drafting the legislative amendments, including criminalising the subdivision of units in industrial buildings for domestic uses to enhance deterrence. The Government aims to submit the amendment bill to the Legislative Council in the first half of 2026."
土地及建設諮詢委員會舉行會議,2025-07-04 21:52,2025-07-04 22:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400887.htm,"土地及建設諮詢委員會今日（七月四日）舉行會議，聽取政府簡介紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地的初步發展建議，以及發展局和教育局鼓勵市場改裝商廈成為學生宿舍的擬議計劃。

委員普遍支持政府透過重新規劃將紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地打造成海濱新地標，從而豐富公眾及旅客於維多利亞港的體驗。委員同意於發展內提供例如餐飲零售等商業元素，並提議為土地用途提供最大的彈性，容許日後發展商可以因應將來的市場環境調整不同類型的商業用途分布。

委員欣悉有關建議將優化行人通達性，包括由北至南（即由內陸至海濱）以及東至西（即紅磡與尖沙咀東之間）兩個方向，並建議進一步研究如何加強連接性，例如與紅磡及尖沙咀東其他已發展但不屬於研究範圍內的區域，並加入更多創新的城市設計元素。在水體運用方面，委員支持於前紅磡貨運碼頭用地毗鄰的水體提供遊艇停泊設施，以應對泊位短缺的問題。委員亦建議政府考慮提供更多便利措施的需要，以配合有關的發展建議，以便更好地推廣遊艇旅遊以及推動遊艇業的發展，並確保公眾能夠享用海濱。

政府會考慮委員的建議及將於七月初完結的諮詢期間所收集到的意見，以優化發展計劃及敲定詳細發展參數，目標是在二○二六年下半年開展相關的法定程序。

就政府建議透過拆牆鬆綁鼓勵商廈改裝成學生宿舍，委員歡迎增加宿位供應的擬議便利措施，讓香港更好地把握未來機遇，加強其作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位。這些措施包括擴展城規制度下「酒店」的用途定義以涵蓋擬議計劃下合資格的學生宿舍；以及為由商廈改裝而成的合資格學生宿舍提供地積比、上蓋面積，以及豁免總樓面面積等寬免措施。委員認為擬議的計劃合符時勢，透過拆牆鬆綁善用市場力量，既在短期內增加宿舍供應之餘，亦有助更有效運用現時市場上商廈的空間。

政府會繼續向業界及持份者簡介擬議的計劃，並預計在今年七月中正式推出計劃。

此外，政府在會上向委員匯報了有關地政總署精簡土地交易流程的最新措施，以提高有關契約修訂、換地申請、私人協約批地，以及其他土地交易的審批流程的透明度和確定性。委員歡迎地政總署的措施，以闡明處理土地交易中主要步驟的審批時間目標。"

一名三十八歲男旅客今日從泰國曼谷飛抵本港。海關人員替他進行清關時，在其兩個寄艙行李內發現該批懷疑大麻花及懷疑含有大麻油的電子煙，遂把該名男子拘捕。

經調查後，該名被捕人士已被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，案件於明日（七月五日）在九龍城裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。

海關會繼續根據風險管理的原則，重點揀選來自高風險地區的旅客作清關檢查，確保有效打擊跨境販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑販毒活動。"

The case involved a 38-year-old male passenger arriving in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds and vapes containing suspected cannabis oil in his two check-in suitcases. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (July 5).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
HKSAR Government spokesman: statement on HKNSL by former Court of Final Appeal non-permanent judge Brenda Hale far from truth,2025-07-04 20:31,2025-07-04 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400780.htm,"A spokesman of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (July 4) said that the statement made by the former non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), Brenda Hale, on the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the rule of law and independent judicial power in Hong Kong is far from the truth, particularly her assertion that the so-called ""the National Security Law has taken over the Basic Law"" is absolutely incorrect and contrary to the facts.

Brenda Hale was appointed as a non-permanent judge of the CFA in 2018 but has never been involved in the hearing of any cases. She indicated to the Judiciary in June 2021 that, for personal reasons, she would not wish to have her appointment extended for another term upon the expiry of her then appointment, which differs from her current statement.

The HKSAR Government spokesman said that any claims that the HKNSL overrides the Basic Law are incorrect. Article 1 of the HKNSL clearly states that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) enacts the HKNSL in accordance with the Constitution, the Basic Law, and the Decision of the National People's Congress on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanisms for Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR. The HKNSL was promulgated and implemented in the HKSAR on June 30, 2020, which has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR. The HKNSL and other laws in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR firmly adhere to the principle of the rule of law while protecting the rights and freedoms enjoyed under the Basic Law in accordance with the law.

The judicial system of the HKSAR is protected by the Basic Law. According to Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law, the HKSAR shall be vested with independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication; the courts shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. All judges and judicial officers abide by the Judicial Oath and administer justice in full accordance with the law, without fear or favour, self-interest or deceit.When adjudicating cases of offences endangering national security, as in any other cases, judges remain independent and impartial in performing their judicial duties, free from any interference. The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven that the courts have handled all the cases involving the HKNSL strictly in accordance with the above principles.

The authority of the NPCSC to interpret the Basic Law and national laws that apply in the HKSAR is a fundamental aspect of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and has long been recognised in the jurisprudence of the HKSAR.It is therefore entirely in line with the ""one country, two systems"" principle that the general power to interpret the HKNSL being a piece of national law, as stipulated in Article 65 thereof, is also vested in the NPCSC. The interpretation given by the NPCSC on Articles 14 and 47 of the HKNSL in December 2022 does not and did not directly deal with any specific judicial proceedings or cases. Rather, it clarifies the meaning of the relevant legal provisions and the basis for application of the HKNSL. It does not in any way impair the independent judicial power and the power of final adjudication of the HKSAR courts as guaranteed by the Basic Law. It is for the HKSAR to resolve specific cases and issues by itself.

The long-time presence of esteemed judges from overseas appointed or reappointed as non-permanent judges of the CFA participating in hearings of the Court, as well as after the enactment of the HKNSL, has been conducive to the international legal environment and the development of the jurisprudence of common law in Hong Kong. There are currently six non-permanent judges from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand in the CFA."

1. 提升學生的數字素養和技能，培養他們成為負責任的公民和終身學習者；
2. 加強數字教育相關的教師專業培訓，鼓勵學校運用創新科技；
3. 優化數字教育基建，促進個性化學習；及
4. 擴大跨境和國際合作，增強協同效應，推動數字教育高質量發展。

她同時呼籲所有持份者，包括政府、教育機構、教育工作者及社會各界，合作優化資源，集思廣益，將數字教育的影響最大化。她亦強調人際聯繫在學習中不可替代的角色，鼓勵與會者明智地運用人工智能以賦能個人、建設社區，並建設一個更具智慧、更加聯通的學習世界。

在典禮上，語常會主席陳黃麗娟博士表示，語常會在語文教育上展現出擁抱科技進步的決心，而這份決心促使語常會組織、撥款支持和主辦是次高峰會。高峰會充當一個創新和探索的協作平台，是香港首批聚焦應用人工智能於教育的國際活動之一。

她指出，人工智能在個性化學習和提升語言習得方面具有轉化潛力。她強調通過有效策略、道德考量和學生為本的方式來引導科技發展的重要性，並鼓勵與會者一同塑造人工智能語言學習的未來，確保人工智能成為教育的促進者而非人際互動的替代品。

香港理工大學校長滕錦光教授在歡迎辭中回應蔡若蓮博士，表示香港在全球人工智能教育和技術驅動學習方面，具有獨特的優勢。他指出，香港擁有世界一流的教育體系、著名的大學，並發展成為國際創新科技中心以及國際專上教育樞紐。

他表示，理大一直致力推動人工智能於教育領域的發展，率先於二○二二年把人工智能納入本科生必修課程，並於今年成立計算機及數學科學學院、理大人工智能高等研究院及語言教學部。這一系列舉措充分展現理大在人工智能賦能教育和研究方面的遠見和領導地位。他期望是次峰會能激發更多具啓發性的想法與協作，重塑香港人工智能教育的發展。

香港教育城董事會主席李漢祥在演講中指，教城致力推動跨界協作，構建完善的人工智能教育生態圈並促進數字教育發展。為加速教育數碼轉型，教城正全力籌備創新電子教學工具超級貨架EdMarket，搜羅包括嶄新人工智能教學工具等全球優質電子教育資源，豐富及啓發創新的學與教模式。

1. enhancing students' digital literacy and skills to prepare them as responsible citizens and lifelong learners;
2. strengthening professional training in digital education for teachers and encouraging schools to leverage innovative technologies;
3. optimising digital education infrastructure and fostering personalized learning; and
4. expanding cross-border and international collaboration to enhance synergy and promote high-quality digital education development.

Dr Choi also called for collaboration among all stakeholders - including the Government, educational institutions, educators, and the community - to optimise resources, share best practices, and maximise the impact of digital education. She also emphasised the irreplaceable role of human connections in learning, encouraging attendees to harness AI wisely to empower individuals, strengthen communities and build a smarter, more connected world of learning.

At the ceremony, the Chairperson of SCOLAR, Dr Anissa Chan, said that SCOLAR is committed to embracing technological advancements in language education. She noted that this commitment was what inspired SCOLAR to organise, finance and host the AIinLT, which is one of the first international events in Hong Kong focusing on the use of AI in education. The AIinLT serves as a collaborative platform for innovation and exploration.

Dr Chan also spoke on the transformative potential of AI in personalising learning and enhancing language acquisition. She stressed the importance of guiding technological development through effective strategies, ethical considerations, and a learner-centred approach. She encouraged participants to shape the future of smart language learning, ensuring that AI serves as an enabler in education rather than a replacement for human interaction.

In his welcome remarks, the President of PolyU, Professor Teng Jinguang, echoed Dr Choi and said that the city of Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to be a global leader in AI-powered education and technology-driven learning, given its world-class education system, renowned universities, and its development into an international innovation and technology centre and international hub for post-secondary education.

He added that PolyU has been promoting the development of AI in education. PolyU was a forerunner university to introduce compulsory AI education for undergraduates back in 2022, and established this year the Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, the PolyU Academy for Artificial Intelligence as well as the Language Education Institute. All these efforts underscore PolyU's far-sightedness and leadership in AI-empowered education and research. He expects that this event will spark meaningful ideas and collaborations that will help reshape AI in education in Hong Kong.

In his address, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hong Kong Education City, Mr Armstrong Lee, emphasised EdCity's unwavering commitment to fostering cross-sector collaboration aimed at establishing a robust AI education ecosystem that propels the advancement of digital education. To expedite the digital transformation of educational practices, EdCity is developing the ""EdMarket,"" an innovative super-shelf for electronic teaching tools. This platform will feature a diverse array of high-quality global educational resources, including pioneering AI teaching tools designed to enrich and inspire transformative teaching and learning methodologies.

The AIinLT is taking place at PolyU for four consecutive days starting from today. The AIinLT on the first two days feature keynote speeches, a panel discussion, paper presentations, and teaching demonstrations. The following two days will include a post-summit workshop series covering a wide range of topics, along with a technology showcase where leading EdTech providers will demonstrate the latest AI hardware and software solutions, offering educators firsthand exposure to cutting edge-innovations.

The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, and the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, officiated at the event. Around 2 000 representatives from school sponsoring bodies, school councils, school head associations, schools and parent-teacher associations attended.

Mr Cheuk said, ""On the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, we have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of safeguarding national security and promoting patriotic education. When you love your country, you will naturally and consciously safeguard its security. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has consistently promoted mainstream values centred on patriotism and love for Hong Kong, which align with the principle of 'one country, two systems'. In April last year, the Working Group on Patriotic Education, chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration, was established to deepen public understanding and appreciation of our nation and the richness of Chinese culture, and to systematically integrate patriotic education into the national education framework. The 'Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0' joint school national education series is a fine example of how the education sector has responded positively to this initiative and worked together to promote patriotic education.""

He continued, ""Tonight's performance of the 'Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country' gala is not only a showcase of the fruitful achievements over the past year but also a valuable opportunity for our students to demonstrate their confidence and talents on stage. We are fortunate to live in an era of national prosperity and strength, and our country has shown particular care for the HKSAR - the most recent example being the Shandong Naval Taskforce's visit to Hong Kong, marking the country's first-ever open-door naval visit. I hope students will turn the knowledge and experiences gained from the 'Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country' activities into positive values and meaningful actions - actively practising the spirit of patriotism and love for Hong Kong. I also hope they will aspire to become a new generation of idealistic, courageous individuals with a strong Hong Kong spirit and national pride, contributing their youthful passion and strength to the cause of national unity and solidarity.""

Mr Cheuk also expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the school sponsoring bodies, school councils, colleagues in the education sector, co-operating organisations, and community partners for their unwavering efforts in promoting patriotic education.

This school year's ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country"" joint school national education activities were scaled up and more diversified than those of last year, with total attendance exceeding 40 000. Apart from teachers and students, some activities also invited parents, experts from different sectors and members of the public to enhance understanding of national education among different stakeholders. The activities included Chinese cultural experiences, learning of intangible cultural heritage skills, visual arts and innovation exhibitions, competitions, and enquiry-based studies on themes aligned with national policies. These activities allowed students to appreciate the richness of Chinese heritage, cultivate affection for their home and country, and build a strong sense of national pride.

Today's gala marked the grand finale of the ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0"" series, which also celebrated the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, and the 28th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. About 300 students participated in the performances, including the flag-raising ceremony and Chinese-style foot drill by joint school flag guards, music, dance, dragon and flag dance, as well as Cantonese opera performance, all showcasing students' fruitful learning achievements.

The EDB will continue to promote ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country"" joint school national education activities in the 2025/26 school year and organise more diversified learning activities to advance national education. These efforts will nurture young people into quality citizens with a strong sense of social responsibility and national identity, as well as a deep affection for Hong Kong."

屋宇署發言人表示：「工業大廈的設計、圖則審批和建造，只擬作工業用途。由於工業樓宇內的單位會用作工業活動，包括用以儲存危險及易燃物品，把工業樓宇非法改作住用用途會對用戶構成嚴重的安全風險。因此，任何人士均不應在工業樓宇內居住。參與樓宇買賣及租務活動的人士，包括準買家、租戶和地產代理等，亦應查明單位的批准用途，不應把工業用途的單位作住用用途。」

就昨日的火警事故，屋宇署已派員到涉事單位展開調查，發現涉事單位被分間為多個細單位，部分分間單位被非法用作住用用途。署方已根據《建築物條例》（《條例》）第25（2）條及26（1）條向有關業主發出法定命令，着令中止將該單位用作住用用途及糾正危險情況。署方會繼續進行調查，如發現有人違反《條例》，定必嚴肅跟進，包括考慮向相關人士提出檢控。此外，屋宇署會把該幢樓宇納入針對工業大廈被非法用作住用用途的大規模行動，安排分批巡查該樓宇的其他單位。

任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從根據《條例》第25（2）條發出的中止用途命令或第26（1）條發出的修葺令屬嚴重罪行。一經定罪，最高可處第五級罰款（目前為五萬元）及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款五千元。

公眾如對樓宇的批准用途有疑問，除可徵詢專業人士的意見外，亦可透過屋宇署的「百樓圖網」系統查閱有關樓宇的佔用許可證及批准建築圖則，以核實有關處所的批准用途。

政府正敲定修訂《條例》的最終建議，並草擬修訂法例，包括將工廈分間單位用作住用用途刑事化，以加強阻嚇力。政府的目標是在二○二六年上半年向立法會提交修訂條例草案。"

Land and Development Advisory Committee holds meeting,2025-07-04 19:56,2025-07-04 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400788.htm,"At its meeting today (July 4), the Land and Development Advisory Committee (LDAC) was briefed by the Government on the preliminary development proposal of sites around Hung Hom Station and its waterfront areas, and the proposed scheme to be launched jointly by the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Education Bureau (EDB) to encourage the market to convert commercial buildings into student hostels.

Members generally welcomed the Government's proposal to transform the sites around Hung Hom Station and its waterfront areas into a new harbourfront landmark through replanning, thereby enriching the public and tourists' enjoyment of the Victoria Harbour. While agreeing that commercial elements such as retail and dining should be provided in the development, Members suggested that land use flexibility should be maximised to allow the future developer(s) to adjust the mix of different types of commercial use in the future having regard to the prevailing market environment.

Members appreciated that the proposal would improve the pedestrian connectivity in both the north-south (from hinterland to waterfront) and east-west (between Hung Hom and Tsim Sha Tsui East) directions, but suggested further studies be conducted to explore further strengthening connectivity, say with other developed areas of Hung Hom and Tsim Sha Tsui East that were currently outside the scope of the study, and to incorporate innovative urban design elements. On the utilisation of water body, Members were in support of the idea of providing yacht berthing facilities at the water body adjacent to the former Hung Hom Freight Yard site to address the shortage of berths. Members also recommended the Government consider the need for formulating more facilitating measures to complement the development proposal to better promote yacht tourism and facilitate the development of the yacht industry, and to ensure that the general public would be able to enjoy the harborfront.

The Government will take into account Members' recommendations and the feedback received during the consultation period to be ended in early July when refining the proposal and finalising the detailed development parameters. The aim is to commence the relevant statutory procedures in the second half of 2026.

On the Government's proposal to streamline development control procedures to encourage conversion of commercial buildings into student hostels, Members welcomed the proposed facilitation measures to boost the supply of hostel accommodation to enable Hong Kong to better grasp opportunities ahead to reinforce its position as an international post-secondary education hub. These measures include expanding the definition of 'Hotel' use under the planning regime to cover eligible student hostels under the proposed scheme; and providing concessions for eligible student hostels converted from commercial buildings with regard to plot ratio, site coverage, and exempted gross floor area, etc. Members considered the proposed scheme timely and relevant, and would leverage market forces through streamlining development procedures to boost hostel supply in the short run on the one hand, and facilitating more effective use of the commercial building stock currently in the market on the other.

The Government will continue to brief the trade and stakeholders on the proposed scheme, which is expected to be rolled out in mid-July this year.

食安中心繼續跟進進口火雞煙肉懷疑受李斯特菌污染,2025-07-04 19:32,2025-07-04 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400786.htm,"食物環境衞生署食物安全中心（中心）今日（七月四日）指，繼昨日公布有源自美國的預先包裝火雞煙肉可能受致病菌李斯特菌污染，中心跟進調查顯示有進口商曾進口其中一款受影響產品。中心呼籲市民不要食用有關產品，業界如持有受影響批次產品，應立即停止使用或出售。

產品資料如下：

產品名稱：Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original
來源地：美國
包裝（產品編號／批次編號）及此日期或之前食用：
（一）12安士（071871548601／RS40），二○二五年七月十八日至八月二日；
（二）36安士（071871548748／RS19、RS40和RS42），二○二五年七月二十三日至九月四日；及
（三）48安士（071871548793／RS19、RS40和RS42），二○二五年七月十八日至九月四日

中心發言人說：「中心一直密切跟進美國農業部早前發出通告，指上述產品可能受李斯特菌污染，正進行回收。中心得悉事件後，已即時跟進事件，並於跟進調查發現有進口商（意得國際有限公司）曾進口其中一款受影響產品（包裝：12安士；此日期或之前食用：二○二五年七月二十六日）。」

  有關進口商已按中心指示將該款受影響產品停售和下架，並展開回收。市民可於辦公時間致電其熱線2526 2371，查詢有關產品的回收事宜。

發言人說：「李斯特菌可在一般烹煮溫度下輕易消滅，但能在冷藏低溫下生存和繁殖。大部分身體健康的人在感染這種細菌後不會出現病徵或只出現輕微病徵如發燒、肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、嘔吐及腹瀉等。但對初生嬰兒、長者和免疫力較低的人，則可能出現嚴重的併發症如敗血症及腦膜炎，甚至死亡。孕婦感染李斯特菌一般症狀輕微，但可導致胎兒流產、夭折、早產，或引致新生嬰兒患上嚴重的感染。」

「為減低感染李斯特菌病的風險，高危人士如孕婦應盡量進食剛煮好的熱食，徹底翻熱冷凍食物，並避免進食或在進食前徹底煮熟高風險食物（即食食物例如凍食肉類、冷燻的海產、軟芝士、沙律等），即使有關食物只屬於一道菜色的一部分。」

中心會就事件通知業界，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"
CFS continues to follow up on imported turkey bacon with possible contamination of Listeria monocytogene,2025-07-04 19:32,2025-07-04 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400787.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (July 4) said that subsequent to yesterday's announcement that kinds of prepackaged turkey bacon originated from the United States (US) might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, a follow-up investigation showed that an importer had imported one of the affected products. The CFS urged the public not to consume the product. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.

Product details are as follows:

Product name: Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original
Place of origin: US
Pack size (Universal Product Code/Lot number) and use-by dates:
(1) 12oz (071871548601/RS40), July 18 to August 2, 2025;
(2) 36oz (071871548748/RS19, RS40 and RS42), July 23 to September 4, 2025; and
(3) 48oz (071871548793/RS19, RS40 and RS42), July 18 to September 4, 2025

  ""The CFS has been closely following up on the notice issued by United States Department of Agriculture indicating that the above-mentioned product might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes and is being recalled. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up on the incident, and learnt during the follow-up investigation that an importer (Etak International Limited) had imported one of the concerned products (pack size: 12oz; use-by date: July 26, 2025).""

The importer concerned has stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected product, and has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2526 2371 during office hours for enquiries about the recall of the product concerned.

  ""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms like fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman said.

""In order to reduce the risk of listeriosis, susceptible populations such as pregnant women should consume freshly prepared hot food where possible, reheat chilled food until it is hot all the way through, and avoid high-risk foods, including ready-to-eat food such as cold cuts, cold smoked seafood, soft cheeses, salads, etc, or cook them thoroughly before consumption, even if they are presented as part of a dish.""

  The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."
政務司副司長出席慶祝《香港國安法》實施5周年暨香港回歸祖國28周年「心繫家國」聯校國民教育活動匯演致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-07-04 19:30,2025-07-04 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400569.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（七月四日）出席慶祝《香港國安法》實施5周年暨香港回歸祖國28周年「心繫家國」聯校國民教育活動匯演的致辭：

王偉明部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部部長）、蔡若蓮局長（教育局局長）、李慧琼議員（愛國主義教育工作小組組長）、馬志民牧師（中華基督教會香港區會執行委員會主席）、李培埡主席（九龍樂善堂主席）、伍怡副主席（東華三院副主席）、譚毓楨副主席（保良局第一副主席兼教育主委）、各辦學團體及議會代表、各位嘉賓、校長、老師、家長和同學：

大家好！很高興出席今天的聯校匯演，和大家一同熱烈慶賀香港回歸祖國28周年，以及《香港國安法》實施五周年，並共同見證「心繫家國3.0」的豐碩成果。「『心繫家國』聯校國民教育活動系列」對我來說別有感覺，因為今次已是我第三年出席這個大型活動，亦足見特區政府相當重視這個系列。

香港自回歸祖國以來，在「一國兩制」的堅實保障下不斷前行。二十八年間，香港與祖國同步發展，在國家的強大支持下，積極參與粵港澳大灣區建設、「一帶一路」倡議等重大發展戰略，展現出蓬勃的發展活力與廣闊的前景。

二○一九年的黑暴事件，相信大家記憶猶新，香港其時被蹂躪得千瘡百孔，「一國兩制」危在旦夕。感謝中央政府果斷出手，在二○二○年六月三十日由全國人民代表大會常務委員會通過制定《香港國安法》，並透過納入《基本法》附件三在香港特區頒布實施。有了《香港國安法》，香港才能抵禦反中亂港分子和外部勢力的攻擊，才有愛國者治港、朗朗乾坤的好局面，讓香港從「由亂到治」走向「由治及興」。《香港國安法》的實施不但回復特區的社會安寧，更為經濟發展提供必須的安定營商環境。近期很多世界排名，都實實在在說明了《香港國安法》令香港的營商和投資環境更勝從前。這些排名包括：「全球最自由經濟體」第一、國際金融中心居世界第三、世界競爭力升至全球第三；以及港股IPO集資額超過800億港元，世界排名第一等。國際高等教育調查機構QS的最新世界大學排名中，本港更有5間大學位列全球百大，足以證明香港在《香港國安法》的保障下，能更安心、更有信心地推動教育。

在《香港國安法》實施5周年的時刻，我們更深刻體會到維護國家安全與推動愛國主義教育的重要性：因為當你愛你的國家，便會自覺、自發地維護國家安全。特區政府一直着力弘揚以愛國愛港為核心、與「一國兩制」方針相契合的主流價值觀。政府去年四月成立由政務司司長出任主席的「愛國主義教育工作小組」，目的就是加強市民對國家及中華優秀文化的認識與認同，並有系統地將愛國主義教育融入國民教育體系。今日「心繫家國3.0」聯校國民教育系列，正正是教育界仝工積極回應這政策、攜手推進愛國主義教育的典範。

「心繫家國」系列自二○二二／二三學年啓動以來，已踏入第三年。隨着多個辦學團體及學校議會的參與，活動規模不斷擴展，至今舉辦的大型聯校活動已超過50項，參與人次累計超過8萬，並透過跨校、跨界別的協作模式，成功在校園營造出濃厚的愛國氛圍。

過去一年，「心繫家國3.0」一共舉辦了28項聯校活動，內容涵蓋中華文化體驗、非遺技藝學習、視藝與創科展覽、與國家政策接軌的主題比賽及專題探究等，讓學生在親身參與中，領略中華文化的底蘊，從中培養家國情懷與民族自豪感。

今晚「心繫家國」的匯演，不僅是過去一年豐碩成果的呈現，更是學生在舞台上展現自信與才華的珍貴時刻。我們很幸運，生處在國家富強的年代，國家也特別關顧香港特區——最近的例子，莫如派遣山東艦編隊來港作全國的首次對外開放參觀。我期望同學們能將從「心繫家國」活動中所獲得的知識與體會，內化為正確的價值觀，再轉化為行動力，積極實踐愛國愛港的精神，立志成為有理想、敢擔當、富香港情懷和國家觀念的新一代，為維護國家統一與民族團結貢獻青春的激情和力量！

最後，我謹衷心感謝各個辦學團體、學校議會、教育界仝工、合作機構及社區夥伴，在推動愛國主義教育上一直不遺餘力的籌辦付出。我亦祝祖國富強昌盛、香港安定繁榮，並預祝今晚匯演圓滿成功，在座各位身心康健、學習愉快！多謝大家。"

反非法勞工行動拘七人（附圖）,2025-07-04 19:07,2025-07-04 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400695.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於六月三十日至昨日（七月三日）在全港多區展開代號「曙光行動」的反非法勞工行動，並聯同勞工處於七月二日執行打擊非法外賣員的「光影行動」。行動中合共拘捕六名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

於「曙光行動」行動中，入境處特遣隊人員搜查了三十四個目標地點，包括裝修中單位、回收場、餐廳及零售店鋪，共拘捕四名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為兩男兩女，年齡介乎四十三至五十九歲。當中一名男子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），一男一女同時涉嫌行使及管有懷疑偽造身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一名五十二歲女子。

於「光影行動」行動中，入境處及勞工處執法人員於九龍西區搜查了二十四個目標地點，共拘捕兩名懷疑非法勞工。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為兩名男子，年齡分別為三十二及三十四歲。該兩名男子均持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"

Four suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and two women, aged 43 to 59. Among them, one man was a holder of a recognisance form, which prohibits him from taking any employment. In addition, one man and one woman were suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. One woman, aged 52, was suspected of employing the illegal workers and was also arrested.

 During operation ""Lightshadow"", ImmD and Labour Department enforcement officers raided 24 target locations in Kowloon West Region. Two suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men, aged 32 and 34. Both of them were holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment.

 An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

 The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

 The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

 According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman reminded all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

 Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

衞生防護中心調查肉毒中毒疑似個案,2025-07-04 17:55,2025-07-04 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400614.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月四日）正調查一宗在內地注射肉毒桿菌毒素後出現肉毒中毒的疑似個案，並呼籲市民只應接受由註冊醫生經臨床評估後處方和注射的肉毒桿菌毒素。

個案涉及一名32歲女病人。根據病人提供的資料，她於七月一日在內地接受聲稱肉毒桿菌毒素注射，同日因為出現肩頸乏力、吞嚥及呼吸困難，所以到伊利沙伯醫院求診，需留院治療，目前情況穩定。臨床診斷懷疑她因注射過量肉毒桿菌毒素導致中毒。

病人報稱接受注射的地點是位於深圳的一間美容診所，為她注射的人員報稱為醫生。中心已將個案通報內地有關當局。流行病學調查仍在進行中。

在香港注射肉毒桿菌毒素只應由本地註冊醫生施行，消費者應了解醫生的全名，並查閲香港醫務委員會註冊醫生名單，同時查詢其專業資格和相關資歷。在香港以外地區接受注射，必須特別謹慎，確認有關人員合資格或已向相關當局註冊執業。來源不明的針劑有可能混雜其他雜質或劑量參差，沒有品質及效果保證，應拒絕接受注射。如有不適，應盡快向合資格醫護專業人員求診。

由於中毒病人的相關肌肉會受影響，而肉毒桿菌毒素亦可能擴散，影響注射部位以外的其他範圍，故病人有機會出現眼瞼下垂、重影或視力模糊、咀嚼困難、聲音沙啞，甚至在吞嚥、說話或呼吸等方面出現問題。這些徵狀可能在注射後數小時、數日或數星期出現。

中心呼籲市民，在注射肉毒桿菌毒素前，注意以下健康建議：


在香港，注射程序只應由本地註冊醫生施行；
注射前，先詳細了解程序、潛在風險和可能出現的併發症。徵詢醫生的意見，作知情的選擇；
不應注射來源不明的針劑；
如曾對肉毒桿菌毒素過敏，或擬注射部位有感染發炎，不應注射；
如獲美容服務提供者轉介至醫生施行程序，應要求以書面形式提供醫生全名，了解其專業資格和相關資歷；及
注射後，如出現肌肉無力或感不適等感染病徵，應立即求醫。

CHP investigates probable case of botulism,2025-07-04 17:55,2025-07-04 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400615.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 4) is investigating a probable case of botulism involving a patient who received injections of botulinum toxin on the Mainland. The CHP reminded the public that they should only receive botulinum toxin injections as prescribed and performed by registered doctors after clinical assessment.

The case involves a 32-year-old female patient. According to the patient, she received injections purporting to be botulinum toxin on the Mainland on July 1. As she presented with weakness of the shoulders and neck, difficulties in swallowing and breathing on the same day, she attended Queen Elizabeth Hospitaland was admitted for treatment. She was clinically suspected to have botulism caused by excessive botulinum toxin injection. She is in stable condition.

The patient reported that she received the injections at a beauty clinic in Shenzhen and that the person who performed the injections claimed to be a doctor. The CHP has reported the case to the Mainland authority.Epidemiological investigations are still ongoing.

  In Hong Kong, botulinum toxin injections should only be performed by a locally registered doctor. Customers should verify the doctor's full name against thelist of registered doctorsof the Medical Council of Hong Kong as well as their professional qualifications and relevant experience. When receiving injections outside Hong Kong, pay special attention to ensure the provider is qualified or registered with relevant jurisdictions for practice. Injections offered from suspicious sources may contain contaminants or varied dosages and their quality and efficacy are not guaranteed. One should refrain from receiving them. If feeling unwell, seek medical advice from eligible medical professionals as soon as possible.

 Due to the weakening of associated muscles and the fact that botulinum toxin may spread and affect other areas beyond the injection site, affected patients may experience drooping eyelids, double or blurred vision, problems with chewing, hoarseness, or even difficulties in swallowing, speaking or breathing, which may happen hours, days or weeks after the injection.

 The CHP urged the public to observe the following health advice before receiving botulinum toxin injections:


Injections in Hong Kong should only be performed by locally registered doctors;
Understand the procedure, potential risks and possible complications before receiving injections. Consult a doctor for an informed decision;
Do not receive injections from suspicious sources;
Do not receive an injection in the case of a history of allergy to botulinum toxin, or if there is an infection or inflammation on the injection site;
Request the full name of the doctor in writing if referred by a beauty service provider for the procedure, as well as the professional qualifications and relevant experience; and
If symptoms develop after injections, such as muscle weakness or feeling unwell, seek medical attention immediately.

海關人員昨日（七月三日）在羅湖管制站截查該名六十四歲抵港男旅客，在其身上搜獲一千一百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約四千八百元，應課稅值約三千九百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

Customs officers intercepted the 64-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (July 3) and seized 1 181 duty-not-paid cigarettes from him, with an estimated market value of about $4,800 and a duty potential of about $3,900. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

特區政府發言人：前終審法院非常任法官何熙怡就《香港國安法》的言論與事實不符,2025-07-04 17:20,2025-07-04 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400604.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府發言人今日（七月四日）表示，前終審法院非常任法官何熙怡對《香港國安法》及有關香港法治及獨立的司法權發表的言論與事實不符，尤其她指所謂「國安法已凌駕《基本法》」這點絕不正確，有違事實。

何熙怡於二○一八年獲委任為終審法院非常任法官，但從未參予任何案件的審理。在二○二一年六月，她向司法機構表示因私人原因於當時任期屆滿後將不續任，這與其現時的說法有差異。

特區政府發言人指出，任何指稱《香港國安法》凌駕於《基本法》之上的言論均屬錯誤之談。《香港國安法》第一條開宗明義指出，全國人大常委會是根據《憲法》、《基本法》和《全國人民代表大會關於建立健全香港特別行政區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制的決定》（全國人大《5.28決定》）制定。《香港國安法》二○二○年六月三十日在香港特區公布實施，填補香港特區維護國家安全法律制度和執行機制的短板漏洞。《香港國安法》與其他香港特區維護國家安全的法律均堅持法治原則，同時依法保護《基本法》規定的權利和自由。

香港特區的司法制度受《基本法》保障。《基本法》第二條、第十九條及第八十五條訂明，香港特區享有獨立的司法權和終審權，法院獨立進行審判，不受任何干涉。所有法官和司法人員緊守司法誓言，以無懼、無偏、無私、無欺之精神，嚴格根據法律原則，維持司法公義。法官在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，一如其他案件，都是獨立公正地履行司法職責，不受任何干涉。五年來的實踐證明，法院嚴格按照上述原則處理涉及《香港國安法》的案件。

全國人大常委會解釋《基本法》及在香港特區實行的全國性法律的權力，是「一國兩制」原則下的重要一環，並早已在香港特區的法理中確立。作為一部全國性法律，《香港國安法》第六十五條規定該法的一般解釋權屬全國人大常委會，完全符合「一國兩制」原則。全國人大常委會二○二二年十二月就《香港國安法》第十四條和第四十七條作出的解釋，並不也沒有直接處理具體司法程序或案件，而是釐清有關法律規定的含義和適用法律的依據，絕不存在損害香港法院受《基本法》保障的獨立審判權和終審權的問題。有關的具體案件和爭議，最終交由香港特區自行解決。

長期以來，包括在《香港國安法》制定後，具聲望的海外法官願意出任或續任香港特區終審法院非常任法官，參與終審法院審判，為本港國際化法律環境及香港普通法的法理發展作出貢獻。目前，終審法院有六名分別來自英國、澳洲和新西蘭的非常任法官。"
財經事務及庫務局局長在香港數字金融大獎2025頒獎典禮致辭全文（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-07-04 17:20,2025-07-04 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400581.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（七月四日）在香港數字金融大獎2025頒獎典禮的致辭全文：

宋總經理（新城廣播有限公司董事總經理宋文禧）、Steven（新城廣播有限公司首席營運總監馬浚偉）、金融科技業界同仁、各位參賽朋友：

大家好。我很榮幸今日出席由新城財經台主辦的香港數字金融大獎2025頒獎典禮。我在此先恭賀各個獲獎的金融機構。

我覺得今日的頒獎典禮在時間上配合得剛剛好，因為我們上星期剛發布了《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》（《政策宣言2.0》），而這個大獎正是要嘉許在香港數字金融產業鏈有卓越表現的金融機構和初創企業，證明我們不謀而合，政府和業界對大力推動數字資產的發展是目標一致的。

香港人向來在應對變化、捕捉機遇方面都不落人後。過去數年當世界各地積極發展數字資產之際，香港其實已密密部署，逐步構建出一套平衡風險管理和投資者保障，以及行業發展的規管框架，促進香港數字資產生態圈的可持續發展。

在二○二二年十月，我們發表首份數字資產發展政策宣言。去年十月，我們再發表有關在金融市場負責任地應用人工智能（AI）的政策宣言。在發牌制度方面，繼已實施的虛擬資產交易平台發牌制度外，《穩定幣條例》亦會於下月一日正式實施，為穩定幣發行人發牌訂下具法律效力的監管制度。另外，我們也正就數字資產交易服務提供者和數字資產託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議諮詢公眾，諮詢期至八月底，希望大家也給我們一些意見。我們期望日後能在交易平台、發行人和服務提供者這三個主要層面，全覆蓋地做好以風險為本的監管，讓香港的數字資產巿場能在穩固的基礎上百花齊放。

大家可看到，政府在迎接數字資產這大趨勢的同時，仍然繼續堅守香港這國際金融中心的強項，那就是早着先機、穩步推進、監管與保障並存。為此，我們上星期發布了《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》，向公眾表述政府在致力打造香港成為全球數字資產領域內創新中心的藍圖和決心。

《政策宣言2.0》提出「LEAP」框架，標誌香港正邁向形成值得信賴（trusted）、可持續（sustainable）且深度融入實體經濟（integrated）的數字資產生態圈。

L代表Legal and regulatory streamlining，即優化法律與監管。我們正構建一套統一而全面的數字資產服務提供者監管框架，涵蓋我剛才提過的數字資產交易平台、穩定幣發行人、數字資產交易服務提供者及數字資產託管服務提供者。四項當中的第一、二項已經做好，即交易平台和穩定幣發行人規管，現在正在做諮詢的就是我剛才提到的數字資產交易和託管服務提供者規管。現時的重點工作是就數字資產交易和託管服務提供者設立發牌制度。我們和證券及期貨事務監察委員會正就相關立法建議進行公眾諮詢。在諮詢期於八月底完結後，我們會參考所得意見，爭取盡快敲定立法建議的細節。

另一方面，我們與金管局（香港金融管理局）亦正牽頭進行全面的法例檢討，以促進現實世界資產及金融工具代幣化，前者是我們常提及的RWA。我們會全面檢視代幣化債券發行及交易的各個流程，包括結算、登記及記錄要求，以及香港現時整體法例內對這些過程和科技應用的適用性，也會看看其他在發行及交易時可能遇到的實際操作問題是否需要做些修訂。我們的目標是要確保因應檢討結果而訂出的相關改善建議切實可行，也能滿足未來在效率、可持續及流動性的發展需求，讓香港繼續站在發展的前沿。

「LEAP」框架的第二個主軸是E：Expanding the suite of tokenised products，即擴展代幣化產品種類。政府在二○二三年和去年已先後兩次以代幣化形式發行綠色債券，而第三批代幣債券亦正在籌備發行。日後，我們會將代幣化政府債券發行常規化，並為現實世界資產代幣化提供誘因，例如豁免代幣化交易所買賣基金（ETF）在轉讓時的印花稅。大家都清楚，現時傳統的ETF在轉讓時的印花稅我們已經豁免了，我們會將其延伸，就算是代幣化的ETF也能在轉讓時獲豁免印花稅。政府亦會推動更廣泛的資產及金融工具代幣化，展示代幣化技術在不同界別，包括貴金屬（如黃金）、有色金屬及可再生能源（如太陽能板）等的多元應用。因為始終代幣化的適用範圍是很廣泛的，並不只限於金融，而是與實體經濟的關聯性很高。

框架的A是指Advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration，即推進應用場景及跨界別合作。近期有關穩定幣的討論非常熾熱，正如我在其他場合所言，穩定幣並非一個「發達工具」，而是發展金融巿場的工具。主要在區塊鏈上流通的穩定幣可以在傳統金融系統以外提供一個具備成本效益的替代方案，有潛力革新支付、供應鏈管理及資本市場活動。

下月起實施的穩定幣發行人發牌制度將有助推進實質應用場景的發展，解決實體經濟所面對的痛點。為確保穩定幣發行的穩定性及可信度，我們在儲備資產管理、穩定機制、贖回流程及審慎風險管理等均已訂下妥善要求，例如儲備資產無論在任何時候都不能低於有機會贖回的價值，同一時間，儲備資產只可放於優質、流動性高的資產，這些只是我們多方面的要求之一，目的都是要提升在香港發行的穩定幣於本地及國際上使用的可靠性。我們亦歡迎巿場參與者提出建議，看看怎樣由政府領頭，試驗及使用獲發牌的穩定幣。另外，香港交易及結算所有限公司已發展香港首批數字資產指數，為投資者在亞洲時區內提供透明可靠的比特幣及以太幣價格基準，支持香港發展成為亞洲領先的數字資產中心。

剛才主持提到今日的活動還有一個很重要的環節，那便是AI演算法交易競賽Global Saudi Arabia Algo Trading Challenge 2025的分享及賽程匯報。這個賽事今年九月將於中東舉行的Money 20/20金融科技盛事期間舉行，而賽事亦首度設立香港站。我剛才聽到香港站賽事反應很好，很多海外和本地參加者都踴躍報名，除了業界外，本地多間大學也有隊伍參與。這既印證全球巿場對香港在推展金融科技的認同，亦代表我們香港在金融科技方面同樣人才輩出。

這個比賽是AI演算法交易的Hackathon，匯聚全球AI及程式設計精英。其實香港金融機構在應用AI方面也很積極，根據全球金融軟件公司Finastra於二○二三年發表的調查報告，香港金融機構的生成式人工智能（GenA.I.）使用率是眾多金融市場中最高，達到百分之三十八，並遠高於全球平均百分之二十六的水平。

香港貨幣及金融研究中心今年四月發表的研究報告亦指出，香港金融服務行業正在穩步應用GenA.I.，百分之七十五受訪金融機構表示已經推出至少一個GenA.I.的用例，或正進行試行計劃和構思用例，並探索具潛質的投資領域，預期相關比率在未來三至五年會上升至百分之八十七。

談過比賽、談到AI應用，其實是想帶出《政策宣言2.0》的第四個主軸—「LEAP」框架的第四項P：People and partnership development，即人才及合作夥伴發展。發展數字資產巿場，人才是必不可缺的。我很高興香港已有不少相關人才，但要讓他們繼續發光發亮，以及吸納更多人才加入，必定需要有所規劃。為此，我們會與業界及學術界合作推動人才發展，並將香港定位為數字資產知識分享超卓中心，以及促進與其他司法管轄區的合作，包括聯合研究計劃及全球的監管協作。我們也會讓學生參與數字資產項目，培養他們成為新一代的企業家、研究人員及技術專家，令我們的人才庫可持續擴大。

在這方面，第一炮是數碼港在《政策宣言2.0》發布當日，已同步推出區塊鏈與數字資產試點資助計劃，接受申請。其概念是為成功申請的初創企業提供發展階段的資金支援，支持它們更好地與實體經濟和實際的應用場景結合，當中資助金額最高可達50萬元。我們期望通過計劃，可測試具有高影響力並有潛力成為未來標竿案例的解決方案，讓我們在區塊鏈及數字資產的應用可持續創新。

各位，香港作為國際金融中心，具備獨特優勢，包括與國際的緊密連結、成熟穩健的金融市場和基礎設施、完善的法律體系，以及大量專業人才等。而在數字資產領域，香港很大程度亦已盡佔先機，我深信在《政策宣言2.0》提出的「LEAP」框架下，正如這個字所指，希望大家都能leap forward。透過政府與業界通力合作，香港絕對有能力將傳統金融融入於數字資產的時代。

最後，我再次恭賀取得香港數字金融大獎2025的各個機構，希望你們日後繼續取得佳績，與我們一起推進香港的數字資產和金融科技發展。而即將參與Trading Challenge的各位參加者，我祝願你們在比賽中都能發揮所長，將香港的金融科技優勢帶到中東，展現給全球的業內精英。

謝謝各位！"

Update on dengue fever,2025-07-04 16:45,2025-07-04 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400479.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (July 4) reported the latest number of dengue fever (DF) cases. The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminded the public that with the arrival of summer and the gradual increase in temperature and rainfall, the mosquito infestation is expected to aggravate in Hong Kong. In addition, members of the public will travel to DF-endemic regions more frequently during the summer holiday. Therefore, the risk of DF in Hong Kong is increasing.

  From June 27 to yesterday (July 3), the CHP recorded one imported DF case. The patient had travelled to India during the incubation period.

As of yesterday, 29 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases. In 2023, 62 imported cases of DF were recorded.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases and more than 7 300 dengue-related deaths were reported in over 80 countries/territories. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number.

  DF is prevalent in many neighboring tourist destinations. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 10 000 cases so far this year. Singapore also recorded over 2 500 cases. Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 49 locally infected cases so far this year. Among these cases, 18 locally infected cases were recorded in Zhongshan, Foshan, Yunfu and Guangzhou in a week between June 16 and 22.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

  ""There have been frequent imported cases of dengue fever in Hong Kong, as well as occasional sporadic local cases every year. The presence of Aedes albopictus in Hong Kong makes our population vulnerable. Mosquitoes breed quickly during the hot, rainy spring and summer months. There are risks of DF outbreaks if mosquito control is inadequate. Hence, mosquito control is of paramount importance. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. The public is reminded that eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites are key to preventing DF. Those returning from areas affected by DF should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. If feeling unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to a doctor,"" Dr Tsui added.

  Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:

Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxes, in covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.


DEET-containing insect repellents are effective and the public should take heed of the tips below:


Read the label instructions carefully first;
Apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
Apply on exposed skin and clothing;
Use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children*;
Apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent; and
Reapply only when needed and follow the instructions.

* For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the DF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook PageandYouTube Channel."
登革熱最新情況,2025-07-04 16:45,2025-07-04 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400478.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月四日）公布登革熱個案的最新數字。中心總監徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，隨着夏季來臨，氣溫及雨量逐漸上升，本港蚊患情況預料會加劇，加上市民在暑假會較頻繁前往登革熱流行地區，因此本地登革熱的風險正在上升。

由六月二十七日至昨日（七月三日），中心錄得一宗外地傳入的登革熱感染個案，病人於潛伏期內曾到印度。

截至昨日，今年錄得29宗外地傳入登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。二○二三年則錄得62宗外地傳入個案。

世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，登革熱的全球發病率在過去20年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家及地區共呈報了逾650萬宗病例和7 300多宗登革熱相關死亡個案。世衞於二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗個案，創歷史新高。

登革熱在眾多鄰近旅遊地點普遍流行，印度尼西亞、馬來西亞、泰國及越南今年至今已各錄得超過一萬宗個案，新加坡亦錄得超過2 500宗個案。另外，根據廣東省疾病預防控制中心的資料，廣東省今年至今共錄得49宗本地感染病例。其中，中山、佛山、雲浮和廣州於六月十六日至二十二日的一周內共錄得18宗本地感染病例。

有關香港和鄰近及海外國家及地區的登革熱最新情況，已上載至衞生防護中心的網頁。

徐樂堅醫生補充：「本港經常有外地傳入的登革熱個案，每年間中亦有零星的本地登革熱個案。由於香港存在白紋伊蚊，本地市民有機會受感染。炎熱多雨的春夏月份有利蚊子迅速繁殖。如控蚊成效不足，更有爆發登革熱的風險。因此，控蚊工作至關重要。不論在本地或外遊時，應時刻保持環境衞生、注意防蚊控蚊及採取個人保護措施。大家應緊記防止蚊子滋生及避免被蚊叮是預防登革熱的最佳方法。市民如從受登革熱影響地區回港，應在14日內繼續使用昆蟲驅避劑。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節。」

市民應繼續採取下列防蚊措施：


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


​含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，市民應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%＊；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；及
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用。

＊如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺。

​​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務登革熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁及YouTube頻道。"
行政長官出席行政長官卓越教學獎（2024/2025）頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-07-04 16:39,2025-07-04 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400582.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（七月四日）出席行政長官卓越教學獎（2024/2025）頒獎典禮的致辭：

葉禮德主席（行政長官卓越教學獎督導委員會主席）、各位得獎教師、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席今日的頒獎典禮。我進場的時候與教育局局長談及教學的重要、教師角色的重要，談及今日卓越教學獎的意義。今次教學獎代表的，是我希望向每一位教師衷心感謝你們的教學工作。我和在座每位一樣，都經歷過讀書的階段、經歷過教師如何正面影響我自己的人生觀、態度和追求的夢想。每一個學生除了自己家人，例如父母對他們的深遠影響外，最大的影響就是教師。你們的一言一語、個人行為、你們安排的活動、曾經和你們所教過的學生所說過的話，都很可能影響他們的一生，讓他們由可能沒甚麼理想變成充滿夢想，追求夢想中的一幅美麗圖畫。又可能學生從不太有熱誠，變成未來在社會很成功的人。我想說的是，縱然你們曾經教授過的學生可能已經成長，在不同崗位很成功，他未必有機會親身答謝你，但在他心目中，他會永遠記得曾經啓蒙自己的老師、曾經令他改變的老師所說的一些說話。

我還記得我讀書的時候，幾位啓蒙老師將我改變。我有機會都會給他們打電話，特別是已經移民的教師。雖然我們通電話時，我未必再重複自己曾因為他們的啓蒙、某一句說話改變了我的人生觀，但大家交流時，心裏也充滿了暖流。所以我在這衷心感謝每一位教師，你們的影響改變了每一位教授過的學生的人生，意義非常重大。我向你們致敬。

首先，我恭賀在座29位獲得本年度行政長官卓越教學獎的教師，亦感謝卓越教學獎督導委員會和社會各界持續推動優質教育。

百年大計，教育為本。政府致力建立專業高質的教師團隊，提升香港的學與教環境。超過二十年以來，我們一直透過行政長官卓越教學獎，表彰在學科知識、教學方法、專業精神等方面表現精益求精的教師，為教育界樹立榜樣，至今超過950位教師獲獎。

今屆獎項聚焦三個重要範疇：中國語文教育、數學教育和價值觀教育。24位獲獎教師具備堅實的專業知識，運用多元的教學策略，啓智潤心，照顧不同學生的需要。

另外，今屆獎項增設我在《施政報告》提出設立的「新秀教師獎」和「創新教育獎」。兩位獲「新秀教師獎」的教師，堅守「立德樹人」的使命，培育學生全人發展；三位獲「創新教育獎」的教師，則以創新思維，結合電子科技，促進學生成長。我很高興見到卓越教學實踐百花齊放，獲獎教師均展現積極求進、勇於創新的精神，為培育人才竭盡所能。

香港全力建設國際高端人才集聚高地，我們的人才為經濟和社會發展提供重要動力。香港的世界競爭力連續兩年上升共四位，現時是全球第三，世界人才排名去年亦上升七位重返十大，排名全球第九，是二○一六年以來首次重回世界十大。

專業教育工作者，是香港人才高地建設的「工程師」，將知識、智慧、德行薪火相傳。今日在座的都是桃李滿門的優秀教師，我對你們有三個期許。

第一，心繫家國，培養愛國愛港的接班人。政府積極深化愛國主義教育，透過學校課程和不同的國民教育活動，從小培養學生的家國情懷。今年是抗戰勝利80周年，政府以「銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平、開創未來」為核心精神，開展不同的學術研討會、到校巡展、考察活動。我鼓勵教育界積極組織學生參與紀念活動，讓他們多接觸國家歷史和最新發展，加強學生的家國情懷。

第二，德才兼備，為學生樹立良好榜樣。政府通過為教師和校長提供有系統及持續的培訓、資助教師參與內地及海外交流、培訓活動多姿多彩和研討會多元、協助教師提高語文水平等，鞏固香港教育高度國際化和多元化的優勢。我相信各位教師都會言傳身教，像你們在課室內外教育學生一樣，持續進修和提升專業水平，並保持良好的個人修養，為香港培養更多優秀人才。

第三，變革創新，善用科技探索新教育模式。科技發展一日千里，人工智能更為人類社會帶來深遠的改變。教育局已成立了數字教育策略發展督導委員會，推動香港學校的數字教育發展。這個星期是首屆「數字教育周」，結合年度盛事「學與教博覽」及人工智能學與教應用國際高峰會，着力推動教育界對人工智能及前沿科技的深入探索和應用。我相信教師們都與時俱進，通過科技打造未來課堂，構建未來學校，培育未來棟樑。

在這瞬息萬變的時代，培育有正確價值觀、慎思明辨、具備家國情懷、全球視野、創新能力的人才，對香港至關重要。各位教師肩負重任，我們一直和全力支持你們的工作。

我期望卓越教學獎能繼往開來，凝聚更多傑出教師，提升教師的專業形象及社會地位，加強尊師重道的風氣，在教育界營造追求卓越的文化，共同為國家教育強國建設作出更大貢獻。

行政長官出席行政長官卓越教學獎（2024/2025）頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-07-04 16:39,2025-07-04 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400582.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（七月四日）出席行政長官卓越教學獎（2024/2025）頒獎典禮的致辭：

葉禮德主席（行政長官卓越教學獎督導委員會主席）、各位得獎教師、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席今日的頒獎典禮。我進場的時候與教育局局長談及教學的重要、教師角色的重要，談及今日卓越教學獎的意義。今次教學獎代表的，是我希望向每一位教師衷心感謝你們的教學工作。我和在座每位一樣，都經歷過讀書的階段、經歷過教師如何正面影響我自己的人生觀、態度和追求的夢想。每一個學生除了自己家人，例如父母對他們的深遠影響外，最大的影響就是教師。你們的一言一語、個人行為、你們安排的活動、曾經和你們所教過的學生所說過的話，都很可能影響他們的一生，讓他們由可能沒甚麼理想變成充滿夢想，追求夢想中的一幅美麗圖畫。又可能學生從不太有熱誠，變成未來在社會很成功的人。我想說的是，縱然你們曾經教授過的學生可能已經成長，在不同崗位很成功，他未必有機會親身答謝你，但在他心目中，他會永遠記得曾經啓蒙自己的老師、曾經令他改變的老師所說的一些說話。

我還記得我讀書的時候，幾位啓蒙老師將我改變。我有機會都會給他們打電話，特別是已經移民的教師。雖然我們通電話時，我未必再重複自己曾因為他們的啓蒙、某一句說話改變了我的人生觀，但大家交流時，心裏也充滿了暖流。所以我在這衷心感謝每一位教師，你們的影響改變了每一位教授過的學生的人生，意義非常重大。我向你們致敬。

首先，我恭賀在座29位獲得本年度行政長官卓越教學獎的教師，亦感謝卓越教學獎督導委員會和社會各界持續推動優質教育。

百年大計，教育為本。政府致力建立專業高質的教師團隊，提升香港的學與教環境。超過二十年以來，我們一直透過行政長官卓越教學獎，表彰在學科知識、教學方法、專業精神等方面表現精益求精的教師，為教育界樹立榜樣，至今超過950位教師獲獎。

今屆獎項聚焦三個重要範疇：中國語文教育、數學教育和價值觀教育。24位獲獎教師具備堅實的專業知識，運用多元的教學策略，啓智潤心，照顧不同學生的需要。

另外，今屆獎項增設我在《施政報告》提出設立的「新秀教師獎」和「創新教育獎」。兩位獲「新秀教師獎」的教師，堅守「立德樹人」的使命，培育學生全人發展；三位獲「創新教育獎」的教師，則以創新思維，結合電子科技，促進學生成長。我很高興見到卓越教學實踐百花齊放，獲獎教師均展現積極求進、勇於創新的精神，為培育人才竭盡所能。

香港全力建設國際高端人才集聚高地，我們的人才為經濟和社會發展提供重要動力。香港的世界競爭力連續兩年上升共四位，現時是全球第三，世界人才排名去年亦上升七位重返十大，排名全球第九，是二○一六年以來首次重回世界十大。

專業教育工作者，是香港人才高地建設的「工程師」，將知識、智慧、德行薪火相傳。今日在座的都是桃李滿門的優秀教師，我對你們有三個期許。

第一，心繫家國，培養愛國愛港的接班人。政府積極深化愛國主義教育，透過學校課程和不同的國民教育活動，從小培養學生的家國情懷。今年是抗戰勝利80周年，政府以「銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平、開創未來」為核心精神，開展不同的學術研討會、到校巡展、考察活動。我鼓勵教育界積極組織學生參與紀念活動，讓他們多接觸國家歷史和最新發展，加強學生的家國情懷。

第二，德才兼備，為學生樹立良好榜樣。政府通過為教師和校長提供有系統及持續的培訓、資助教師參與內地及海外交流、培訓活動多姿多彩和研討會多元、協助教師提高語文水平等，鞏固香港教育高度國際化和多元化的優勢。我相信各位教師都會言傳身教，像你們在課室內外教育學生一樣，持續進修和提升專業水平，並保持良好的個人修養，為香港培養更多優秀人才。

第三，變革創新，善用科技探索新教育模式。科技發展一日千里，人工智能更為人類社會帶來深遠的改變。教育局已成立了數字教育策略發展督導委員會，推動香港學校的數字教育發展。這個星期是首屆「數字教育周」，結合年度盛事「學與教博覽」及人工智能學與教應用國際高峰會，着力推動教育界對人工智能及前沿科技的深入探索和應用。我相信教師們都與時俱進，通過科技打造未來課堂，構建未來學校，培育未來棟樑。

Applications open for auction of spectrum in 2.5/2.6 GHz band,2025-07-04 16:25,2025-07-04 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400295.htm,"  The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) today (July 4) published the information memorandum for the auction of radio spectrum in the 2.5/2.6 GHz band and invited interested parties to submit applications.

 A spokesperson for OFCA said, ""As announced in the 2024 Policy Address, the Government will continue to make available more suitable radio spectrum to the market in a timely manner to support wider and more advanced applications of communications technology (including 6G). The Communications Authority (CA) and the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development (SCED) issued a joint statement in April this year, announcing the decision to reassign a total of 50 MHz of spectrum in the aforementioned band through auction in the fourth quarter of this year. The mid-band spectrum balances the needs of both network coverage and capacity and has the potential to support mobile broadband services and other innovative applications using 5G or more advanced mobile services.""

 The CA will conduct the auction of the 50 MHz of spectrum in the aforementioned band on October 20. The spectrum will be reassigned to the successful bidders under unified carrier licences with a new assignment period of about 10 years and 10 months. The arrangement enables all 140MHz of spectrum in the 2.5/2.6GHz band to expire together onMarch 30,2039, so that the CA can carry out holistic spectrum planning and reassign relevant spectrum more flexibly having regard to future mobile technology development to enhance spectral efficiency. Parties interested in participating in the auction may submit their applications to OFCA from September 4 to 5.

 The SCED has set the auction reserve price for the use of the spectrum in the 2.5/2.6 GHz band, i.e. $4 million per MHz. The actual amount of spectrum utilization fees payable will be determined through the auction.

 Detailed arrangements for the auction are set out in the information memorandum, which is available on OFCA's website."

15 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-07-04 16:00,2025-07-04 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400535.htm,"  Fifteen landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7), pleaded guilty and were fined a total of $103,200 on June 20 and today (July 4) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 098 cases to date. Among the 762 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 661 SDU landlords with fines ranging from $400 to $41,600, amounting to a total of $1,944,810. In addition, 336 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 15 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; (2) failing to provide the tenant with a rent receipt; and (3) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance). One of the landlords committed 44 offences under (1) and (3) and was fined $41,600.

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon an in-depth investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to facilitate SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."
15名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-07-04 16:00,2025-07-04 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400531.htm,"15名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於六月二十日及今日（七月四日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款共103,200元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 098宗個案，而就法庭已處理的762宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及661名分間單位業主，罰款介乎400元至41,600元，合計總罰款共1,944,810元，另有336宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該15名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；（二）沒有提供租金收據予租客；及（三）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。其中一名業主觸犯上述（一）及（三）項共44宗罪行而被判處罰款41,600元。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

如就規管租賃事宜有疑問，可致電電話熱線（2150 8303）或瀏覽估價署網頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/our_services/part_iva.html）內的相關資訊。"

  Compared with the grading released last week, Big Wave Bay Beach has been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2, and Castle Peak Beach and Ma Wan Tung Wan Beach from Grade 2 to Grade 3.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

代表團正藉香港特別行政區（特區）政府於六月二十六日發布《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》（《政策宣言2.0》）的最佳時機訪日。《政策宣言2.0》重申特區政府致力將香港打造成數字資產領域中的全球創新中心。政策宣言提出「LEAP」框架，包括優化法律與監管、擴展代幣化產品種類、推進應用場景及跨界別合作，以及人才與合作夥伴發展。《政策宣言2.0》闡明政府構建一個值得信賴和着重創新的數字資產生態圈的願景，以風險管理及保障投資者為先，同時致力為實體經濟和金融市場帶來實質效益。

劉智元續稱：「投資推廣署的專責團隊已準備好支持數字資產生態圈，為潛在的數字資產服務提供者與銀行及專業服務建立聯繫，並促進其在港設立及擴展業務。」

雙向商務合作成果豐碩共創發展新里程

日本企業Zaiko通過投資推廣署的二○二四年訪日代表團，成為首間成功落戶香港的企業。作為Headline Asia的重點投資項目，Zaiko平台運用線上活動、視頻直播及數據分析技術，強化創作者與支持者的互動。這項引入投資實例展示日本科技專長能夠與香港蓬勃發展的經濟界別（例如創意及活動產業）相輔相成的潛力。

Waffo於二○二三年落戶香港，以此作為亞洲拓展基地，隨即參與二○二四年訪日代表團。該公司發掘了新商機，不僅成功開拓日本市場，在當地設立辦事處，成功與多家日系客戶合作，推出創新跨境支付與風控方案。Waffo一直以香港為亞洲業務拓展基地，今年再度參與代表團，進一步強化日本市場增長。

高迪安集團是一家總部位於香港、擁有深厚房地產開發背景的多元化產業集團，旗下的家族辦公室，近年來正積極佈局迅速發展的數字資產領域。在投資推廣署的支持與協助下，集團獲得了香港金融生態系統中的前沿市場資訊、先進金融科技應用及高潛力的商業合作機會。借助這些優勢，高迪安集團今年參與代表團並在日本正式啓動房地產代幣化項目，標誌著集團在跨境數字資產創新及區域合作方面邁出重要一步。

投資推廣署此次代表團充分展現香港與日本在Web3及金融科技領域上的進一步協作。這種優勢互補的合作模式，正為兩地開啓創新發展、互利共贏的新篇章。隨著在創新科技與投資領域持續深化合作，兩地將推動數字經濟上雙向奔赴，迎來更廣闊的發展前景。"

Invest Hong Kong strengthens Web3 and fintech ties between Hong Kong and Japan (with photos),2025-07-04 15:00,2025-07-04 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070200704.htm," âInvest Hong Kong (InvestHK) has successfully concluded an impactful visit to Japan, deepening business ties between the two places. The delegation's primary objectives were to promote two-way business opportunities in Web3 and fintech, and to facilitate strategic technology investments that benefit bothplaces.

 From June 30 to July 4, Senior Vice President of Fintech at InvestHK Ms Pauline Fan led a delegation of 16 Hong Kong companies, organisations, universities and a family office to Japan. These included Hong Kong Baptist University, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Web3 Harbour. Meetings and events were held in Osaka and Kyoto together with partners in Japan, including HashPort, Headline Asia, and IVC.

 In Osaka on June 30 and July 1, delegates engaged with key players in innovation and digital transformation. They met with members of the Osaka Prefectural Government, the Osaka Digital Exchange, the Japan External Trade Organization, SBI Corporation, Plug and Play Japan, the NTT West Corporate Innovation Center and more. These meetings facilitated meaningful exchanges and explorations of new business partnerships and investments. The momentum continued in Kyoto from July 2 to 4 at IVS 2025, the largest start-up conference in Japan, organised by Headline Asia and IVC. Industry leaders and emerging start-ups exchanged insights on fundraising, business partnerships, and breakthrough trends in Web3 and more.

 Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Arnold Lau said ""This delegation marks a significant milestone in solidifying the collaboration between Hong Kong and Japan in innovation and technology. With a strong influx of innovative ideas and investment flows between both sides, we are entering a pioneering era where groundbreaking technologies in Web3 and fintech are poised to redefine the future of digital economies.""

 This delegation visit came at a perfect time following the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong, issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government on June 26. It reinforces the HKSAR Government's commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in the digital asset (DA) field. The statement introduces the ""LEAP"" framework: Legal and regulatory streamlining, expanding the suite of tokenised products, advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and people and partnership development. It sets out a vision for a trusted and innovative DA ecosystem that prioritises risk management and investor protection, while delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets.

 ""Our dedicated team at InvestHK is ready to support players in the DA ecosystem, connecting prospective DA service providers with banks and professional services to facilitate their business setup and expansion in Hong Kong,"" Mr Lau added.

Two-way business success driving the agenda forward

 Japanese firm Zaiko was the first company to establish a presence in Hong Kong through a similar delegation to Japan in 2024, facilitated by InvestHK. As a key portfolio company of Headline Asia, Zaiko serves as a platform that connects creators directly with people through digital events, video streaming, and data analytics. This inward investment exemplifies the potential for Japanese technology expertise to seamlessly merge with the vibrant economic sectors of Hong Kong, such as creative and event industries.

 Waffo established a Hong Kong office in 2023 as its strategic hub for Asia and immediately joined the 2024 InvestHK Japan delegation. The company uncovered new opportunities and successfully entered the Japanese market by opening representative offices, collaborating with multiple Japanese clients and launching innovative cross-border payment and risk-management solutions. Leveraging Hong Kong as its launch pad, Waffo once again participated in this year's delegation to further accelerate its growth in Japan.

 The Goldian Group is a diversified conglomerate headquartered in Hong Kong with a strong background in real estate development. In recent years, its family office has strategically pivoted towards the fast-evolving field of digital assets. With the support and facilitation from InvestHK, the Group has gained access to cutting-edge market intelligence, advanced fintech applications and high-potential business opportunities in Hong Kong's financial ecosystem. Leveraging these advantages, the Goldian Group joined this year's delegation and formally launched a real estate tokenisation initiative in Japan, marking a key step in cross-border digital asset innovation and regional collaboration.

 With these achievements, InvestHK's latest delegation clearly illustrates the rising synergy between Hong Kong and Japan's Web3 and fintech industries, a collaboration that promises a new chapter of ingenuity, growth, and mutual prosperity. As both markets continue to harness innovation and investment, the future looks brighter than ever for such two-way partnerships in the digital economy."

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-04 14:52,2025-07-04 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400511.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference.

S for Housing continues Portugal visit to promote development opportunities in GBA (with photos),2025-07-04 13:11,2025-07-04 13:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400249.htm,"âThe Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, continued her visit to Lisbon, Portugal, yesterday (July 3, Lisbon time).

Ms Ho attended a business luncheon co-organised by the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development Office under the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Brussels to promote the vast opportunities for Portuguese companies arising from the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and how Hong Kong can play its important roles as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" between the two places with its unique advantages of having the strong support of the motherland while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world. Around 130 participants attended the luncheon, with representatives from over 80 Portuguese enterprises from the construction sector, information technology sector, commercial sector and professional organisations, as well as representatives from 17 relevant Hong Kong enterprises.

During the luncheon, Ms Ho highlighted that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been actively promoting the use of innovative construction technologies to enhance the speed, quantity, quality and efficiency in increasing the supply of affordable housing. Under the Housing•I&T initiative this year, the Housing Bureau (HB) will organise a series of activities to foster exchanges between Hong Kong and other countries and regions in areas such as smart construction, smart estate management, energy saving and green buildings. She encouraged Portuguese enterprises to seize these opportunities and strengthen collaborations with the Mainland and Hong Kong.

Ms Ho expressed her gratitude in particular to the trade representatives from Hong Kong, including those participating in the construction of public housing, Light Public Housing (LPH) and transitional housing, for attending the luncheon in Lisbon and taking the opportunity to share in person with the participants Hong Kong's opportunities and advantages in connecting the Mainland and the world. By complying with international standards, stipulating local regulations and harnessing the strengths of the GBA in smart construction, Hong Kong can further advance in its development of Modular Integrated Construction (MiC), the transfer of on-site construction processes to factories and the application of construction robotics. With the expeditious building ofLPH and transitional housing, the living conditions and quality of life of people living in inadequate housing can be improved as soon as practicable. The significant housing production target of 308 000 public housing units over the next 10 years also enables the HB and the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) to promote the adoption of innovative technologies and advance public housing developments in a new era of smart construction.

Earlier in the day, Ms Ho visited EntreCampos, a local redevelopment project jointly developed by the public and private sectors, comprising social housing for middle-class residents, offices, retail, community facilities and green spaces. The project adopted Building Information Modelling (BIM) during construction. She also visited the new headquarters of an insurance company in the project. The building employs smart technologies and innovative sustainable energy systems to enhance energy efficiency. Ms Ho stated that the HKHA has strived to promote greener and more energy-efficient designs, aiming to attain a ""gold"" rating or above under BEAM Plus for all new housing developments. The measures include adopting MiC in construction with modules manufactured accurately and effectively in factories, and other innovative technologies such as BIM to facilitate planning throughout the construction process and enhance management, which can save energy, reduce waste and make the construction process more environmentally friendly. To improve energy efficiency, the HKHA has also implemented various green initiatives such as smart lighting control systems, light emitting diode lighting and solar photovoltaic systems. In estate management, the application of the Internet of Things and AI for collecting and analysing data has also enhanced estate management quality and efficiency. She said she looked forward to continued exchanges between Hong Kong and Portugal on innovative construction technologies and green building designs.

Ms Ho has arrived in Barcelona, Spain, last night and will begin her visit there today (July 4, Barcelona time)."
房屋局局長繼續葡萄牙訪問行程推廣粵港澳大灣區發展機遇（附圖）,2025-07-04 13:10,2025-07-04 13:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400248.htm,"​房屋局局長何永賢昨日（里斯本時間七月三日）繼續在葡萄牙里斯本的訪問行程。

何永賢出席由政制及內地事務局粵港澳大灣區發展辦公室與香港駐布魯塞爾經濟貿易辦事處合辦的商務午餐會，推廣粵港澳大灣區發展為葡萄牙企業帶來的龐大機遇，以及香港如何利用背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，發揮其作為兩地之間「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的重要功能。午餐會約130位人士出席，當中包括來自近80間葡萄牙建築業界、資訊科技業界、商界企業及專業團體的代表，以及17間香港相關業界代表。

何永賢在午餐會上指，香港特區政府一直大力推動應用創新建築科技以提速、提量、提質、提效增加可負擔房屋的供應。今年房屋局更以「共築．智能」為主題，透過一系列活動，促進香港與各地就智能建造、智慧屋邨管理、節能綠建等範疇的交流發展。她鼓勵葡萄牙企業抓緊機遇，加強與內地和香港的合作連繫。

她又特意感謝來自香港的業界代表來到里斯本出席午餐會，當中包括參與興建公營房屋、「簡約公屋」及過渡性房屋的業界朋友，把握這個機會親自向與會嘉賓分享香港盡享「內聯外通」的機會和優勢，既接通國際標準，善用香港規範，亦借力灣區「智造」，讓香港不論在「組裝合成」建築法（MiC）、建屋「工廠化」、建築機械人的應用等，都能更進一步發展。透過快速興建「簡約公屋」及過渡性房屋，盡快改善居住於不適切居所市民的居住環境。同時，未來十年興建308 000個公營房屋單位的龐大的建屋量，也成為為房屋局和香港房屋委員會（房委會）促進創新技術落地的好機會，帶領公營房屋發展邁進智能建造新紀元。

此外，何永賢早上參觀當地一個由公私營合作發展，包含以中產住戶為對象的社會房屋、辦公室、零售、社區設施和綠化空間的重建項目EntreCampos，項目興建過程中採用建築信息模擬技術（BIM）。她亦參觀了項目內一間保險公司的新總部大樓，該大樓利用智能科技、創新的可持續能源系統提高能源效益。何永賢指，房委會一直致力於推動更環保、更節能的設計，所有新項目均以「綠建環評」的「金級」或以上評級為目標，措施包括在建築過程中運用MiC，在廠房更精準、高效地生產組件；利用BIM等創新科技協助施工規劃及優化管理，從而節能減廢，令工程更環保。為提升能源效益，房委會亦實施多項綠色措施，例如智慧照明控制系統、發光二極管（LED）照明和太陽能光伏系統等。屋邨管理方面，利用物聯網和人工智能來收集和分析不同數據，也為屋邨管理提質、提效。她期望兩地未來繼續就創新建屋技術、綠色建築設計等緊密交流。

何永賢昨晚已轉抵西班牙巴塞羅那，今日（巴塞羅那時間七月四日）展開在當地的訪問行程。"

尊敬的陳楓副署長（國安公署副署長）、潘雲東副特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、王偉明部長 （中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部部長）、曾鈺成校監（培僑中學校監）、伍煥杰校長（培僑中學校長）、黎旨軒專員（東區民政事務專員）、各位嘉賓、各位老師、各位同學（包括從蘇州來的老師和同學）：

大家好！今天很高興出席習主席回信培僑中學高一學生兩周年及培僑中學喜迎國旗儀式活動，與大家分享獲贈國家這份珍貴禮物的莫大喜悅和興奮。

今年是抗戰勝利80周年，也是世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年，意義重大。國旗正是國家主權和尊嚴的象徵。為促進國民教育及培養學生的國家觀念和民族感情，以及加強學生對國民身分的認同，現時中小學在每個上課日升掛國旗；每周舉行一次升國旗儀式；並在重要的日子－－例如香港特別行政區成立紀念日和國慶日－－及特別場合舉行升國旗儀式。不少學校亦組織升旗隊，並在升國旗儀式後安排「國旗下講話」，由教師和同學探索國家新近發展、中華文化、中國歷史等題目，持續深化同學的國家觀念和文化自信，弘揚愛國主義精神，落實愛國主義教育。

按《中華人民共和國國旗法》的規定，國旗的通用尺度有五種，最大的一種長2.88米、高1.92米；而天安門廣場上升掛的國旗則是個特例，長5米、寬3.3米，是全國升掛的國旗中最大的。為傳承紅色基因，部分使用過和具有特殊歷史節點的天安門國旗，會贈送給政府機關、學校等。剛剛伍校長的分享中提到，北京市人民政府天安門地區管理委員會在今年七月一日向培僑中學贈送國旗，這面國旗曾於二○二三年七月二十四日在天安門廣場升起，正正是國家主席習近平回信培僑中學同學的大日子！國家的這個心意和心思，充分彰顯了國家對培僑中學以至香港年輕一代的關懷和勉勵。我相信，培僑中學的老師及學生們必定深深感受到祖國的厚愛。

習主席回信中特別提及，「愛國主義是中華民族精神的核心，廣大香港同胞素有愛國愛港光榮傳統，這是『一國兩制』行穩致遠的重要基礎。」習主席回信兩周年在即，我勉勵同學們要好好牢記當中的精神和指導，繼續深入了解祖國悠久的歷史、優秀的文化和現實國情，鞏固對國家和中華文化的認識和認同，同時亦要深刻認識世界發展大勢。作為香港未來的主人翁，同學們要把握香港「背靠祖國、聯通世界」的獨特優勢，好好裝備自己，貢獻國家、貢獻香港。

培僑中學接過從北京天安門來的國旗，意義重大：這猶如奧運會的運動員傳遞火炬，可以把愛國精神傳承並宣揚到香港其他的學校，讓更多同學們在國旗下茁壯成長，為民族復興、建設香港付出青春的力量！謝謝大家。"

Selection completed for fourth cohort of School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme,2025-07-04 11:00,2025-07-04 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400198.htm,"âThe Education Bureau (EDB) today (July 4) announced the completion of the selection process for the fourth cohort of the School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme (SNDAS).
  
A total of 814 valid SNDAS nominations were received from 420 secondary schools for the fourth cohort. In the past few months, the eight University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities participating in the Scheme arranged interviews for the nominated students and carefully considered their individual merits. Firm offers were eventually made to 342 nominees prior to the release of the 2025 Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination results, of which 335 have accepted the offers and will commence study on their chosen UGC-funded undergraduate programmes in September 2025 in a wide spectrum of disciplines including architecture, surveying and town planning, arts and humanities, business, computing and engineering, environmental studies, design, fine arts, language, law, medicine and health, music, sciences and social sciences. A breakdown by study discipline is provided in the Annex.
  
The Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, was pleased to note the encouraging results of the fourth cohort of the SNDAS, in particular the continuing increase in the number of offers made to successful nominees.
  
  ""Talent in diversified skills and knowledge is the key to Hong Kong's future development. The Government has always placed great emphasis on nurturing young people, striving to enhance the education system and creating diverse opportunities for students to reach their full potential in different areas. I am deeply grateful for the support from secondary schools and universities for the SNDAS, as well as their recognition of students' multifaceted talents, and for cultivating more future talent for Hong Kong,"" Dr Choi said.

To promote a culture of multifaceted excellence, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau has launched the Multi-talent Development Scholarship (MDS) in the 2025/26 academic year, funded by the Board of Management of the Chinese Permanent Cemeteries, for admittees of the SNDAS demonstrating outstanding achievements in arts, sports and/or community service on top of the firm offers made under the SNDAS.

Among the students being formally admitted to their respective universities under the SNDAS, each of the eight UGC-funded universities will be invited to nominate SNDAS admittees demonstrating an outstanding performance in arts, sports and/or community service for awarding scholarships in addition to the firm offers made. The quotas of scholarship nominations will be distributed proportionally having regard to the number of students admitted to each university by the SNDAS. Each awardee, not subject to means testing, will be granted a scholarship of $10,000 per year across his/her four-year tuition period. Universities shall enjoy the autonomy to select and nominate awardees for the MDS.

The fifth cohort of the SNDAS will be open for applications by Secondary Six students taking the 2026 HKDSE Examinations and commencing their undergraduate studies in September 2026. Details of the application arrangements will be announced in due course.
  
The SNDAS was introduced in 2021 as part of EDB's response to the recommendations made by the Task Force on Review of School Curriculum, which included enhancing flexibility in university admissions. The eight UGC-funded universities had designated around 300 publicly funded undergraduate programmes for the fourth cohort of the SNDAS and set admission criteria that are not based on HKDSE Examination results for individual programmes."

Commissioner Cui Jianchun (Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Professor Teresa Cheng (Co-Chairman of the Asian Academy of International Law), Dr Anthony Neoh (Co-Chairman of the Asian Academy of International Law), consuls-general, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. And welcome to Hong Kong. Welcome to the 2025 Colloquium on International Law.

  Gathered here today, are some 200 legal professionals and government and institutional leaders – from Hong Kong, the Mainland and some 40 jurisdictions in Asia and around the world.

  I would also like to extend a special welcome to His Excellency Dr Kamalinne Pinitpuvadol, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization, here with more than 30 delegates from the international organisation. Also, a special thanks to Mr Miguel de Serpa Soares, former Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and United Nations Legal Counsel.

  This year's Colloquium spotlights two key themes: the United Nations' 80th anniversary, and LawTech, AI (artificial intelligence) and the future of the international order. I was told that we have simultaneous interpretation by AI on the screen. All in the aspiration of bridging innovation and governance.

  The establishment of the United Nations, in 1945, marked a new chapter in multilateralism, creating an international organisation responsible for collective action on global issues, with the goal of fostering peace, security and development.

  China, our country, is a founding member of the UN (United Nations) and one of the UN Security Council's five permanent members. China actively participates in the UN, playing a significant role in shaping international law and responses to global issues.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys unparalleled access to both the Mainland and the world. Hong Kong participates in various commissions and groups under the UN, as members of Chinese delegations, in accordance with the Basic Law.

  In the eight decades since the UN's establishment, technology has transformed our world. Its endless reshaping of societies, and peoples, is also a UN priority. And that very much includes artificial intelligence, a fast-growing area in innovation and technology.

  From trading floors and hospital wards, to schools and law courts, AI now permeates every sector – not as a distant future, but as today's operational heartbeat. Hong Kong, dedicated to developing into an international I&T (innovation and technology) centre, recognises this tidal shift. Mastering AI is no longer a competitive edge. It is the existential infrastructure for every industry and sector.

  Last September, a UN Secretary-General's High-level Advisory Body on AI published the report ""Governing AI for Humanity"". It highlighted the need to boost global co-operation, noting that only an ""inclusive and comprehensive approach to AI governance"" can address the ""multifaceted and evolving challenges and opportunities AI presents on a global scale"".

  Hong Kong is strategically positioned to promote international collaboration in advancing AI.

  Under ""one country, two systems"", we have long been a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", bringing together China and the rest of the world. And providing key value-adding professional services along the way.

  The HKSAR Government actively promotes LawTech, including online dispute resolution and the use of AI.

  Our Department of Justice has established a Consultation Group on LawTech Development, which dedicates its efforts to developing LawTech strategies for the legal and dispute resolution sector.

  Last month, we held our first LexGoTech Roundtable, to advance the sector's understanding of LawTech and its applications, with focused discussions on the opportunities and challenges of LawTech and AI.

  As for online dispute resolution, Hong Kong is one of seven economies, alongside such places as Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and the United States, to follow APEC's (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Collaborative Framework for Online Dispute Resolution of Cross-Border Business-to-Business Disputes. The Framework was designed to help businesses resolve disputes online through negotiation, mediation and arbitration.

  We have also been collaborating with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, establishing a Hong Kong-based Project Office for collaboration with the Commission in 2020. The Project Office provides important support to the Inclusive Global Legal Innovation Platform on Online Dispute Resolution, which converges international efforts, across different jurisdictions, to advance this form of dispute resolution. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a salient example of our dedication to international collaboration, and the development of technology for legal services.

  The HKSAR Government fully supports the work of the United Nations, especially in promoting the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

  Just over a month ago, the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation was signed here in Hong Kong, I'm pleased to say.

  The International Organization for Mediation, or IOMed, will become the world's first inter-governmental, international organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation, a peaceful means to maintain international peace and security, as stipulated in the Charter of the UN.

  I am grateful to the Central Government for its support of Hong Kong, as well as the trust from other signing states, for giving us the honour of serving as the IOMed's headquarters. It will be based in the former Wan Chai Police Station, a historic architecture that has long been part and parcel of Hong Kong's law and order, and I am hopeful it will open by the end of the year.

  The IOMed's mandate is clear and compelling: to resolve international disputes based on mutual respect and understanding. And it will be available to all countries, regardless of their culture, language or legal system.

  That, ladies and gentlemen, will certainly improve global governance. And promote world peace and stability.

  My thanks to the Asian Academy of International Law and its Foundation, as well as the Chinese Society of International Law, for once again organising this seminal international law event, for bringing prominent international legal professionals and speakers to Hong Kong to discuss the latest issues, concerns and promising developments in law.

  And while you're here, make good time to discover what the world city of Hong Kong has to offer – in arts, culture and entertainment, on our islands and coastal areas, our Michelin-starred restaurants, dim sum parlours, pubs, diners and cafes – all of them brimful of the best of East and West. Enjoy it all.

  I wish you all a rewarding Colloquium, and the best of legal business, and mediation, in the year to come.

  Thank you."

  This year's Colloquium spotlights two key themes: the United Nations' 80th anniversary, and LawTech, AI (artificial intelligence) and the future of the international order. I was told that we have simultaneous interpretation by AI on the screen. All in the aspiration of bridging innovation and governance.

  The establishment of the United Nations, in 1945, marked a new chapter in multilateralism, creating an international organisation responsible for collective action on global issues, with the goal of fostering peace, security and development.

  China, our country, is a founding member of the UN (United Nations) and one of the UN Security Council's five permanent members. China actively participates in the UN, playing a significant role in shaping international law and responses to global issues.

  Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong enjoys unparalleled access to both the Mainland and the world. Hong Kong participates in various commissions and groups under the UN, as members of Chinese delegations, in accordance with the Basic Law.

  In the eight decades since the UN's establishment, technology has transformed our world. Its endless reshaping of societies, and peoples, is also a UN priority. And that very much includes artificial intelligence, a fast-growing area in innovation and technology.

  From trading floors and hospital wards, to schools and law courts, AI now permeates every sector – not as a distant future, but as today's operational heartbeat. Hong Kong, dedicated to developing into an international I&T (innovation and technology) centre, recognises this tidal shift. Mastering AI is no longer a competitive edge. It is the existential infrastructure for every industry and sector.

  Last September, a UN Secretary-General's High-level Advisory Body on AI published the report ""Governing AI for Humanity"". It highlighted the need to boost global co-operation, noting that only an ""inclusive and comprehensive approach to AI governance"" can address the ""multifaceted and evolving challenges and opportunities AI presents on a global scale"".

  Hong Kong is strategically positioned to promote international collaboration in advancing AI.

  Under ""one country, two systems"", we have long been a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", bringing together China and the rest of the world. And providing key value-adding professional services along the way.

  The HKSAR Government actively promotes LawTech, including online dispute resolution and the use of AI.

  Our Department of Justice has established a Consultation Group on LawTech Development, which dedicates its efforts to developing LawTech strategies for the legal and dispute resolution sector.

  Last month, we held our first LexGoTech Roundtable, to advance the sector's understanding of LawTech and its applications, with focused discussions on the opportunities and challenges of LawTech and AI.

  As for online dispute resolution, Hong Kong is one of seven economies, alongside such places as Indonesia, Japan, Singapore and the United States, to follow APEC's (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) Collaborative Framework for Online Dispute Resolution of Cross-Border Business-to-Business Disputes. The Framework was designed to help businesses resolve disputes online through negotiation, mediation and arbitration.

  We have also been collaborating with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, establishing a Hong Kong-based Project Office for collaboration with the Commission in 2020. The Project Office provides important support to the Inclusive Global Legal Innovation Platform on Online Dispute Resolution, which converges international efforts, across different jurisdictions, to advance this form of dispute resolution. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a salient example of our dedication to international collaboration, and the development of technology for legal services.

  The HKSAR Government fully supports the work of the United Nations, especially in promoting the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

  Just over a month ago, the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation was signed here in Hong Kong, I'm pleased to say.

  The International Organization for Mediation, or IOMed, will become the world's first inter-governmental, international organisation dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation, a peaceful means to maintain international peace and security, as stipulated in the Charter of the UN.

  I am grateful to the Central Government for its support of Hong Kong, as well as the trust from other signing states, for giving us the honour of serving as the IOMed's headquarters. It will be based in the former Wan Chai Police Station, a historic architecture that has long been part and parcel of Hong Kong's law and order, and I am hopeful it will open by the end of the year.

  The IOMed's mandate is clear and compelling: to resolve international disputes based on mutual respect and understanding. And it will be available to all countries, regardless of their culture, language or legal system.

  That, ladies and gentlemen, will certainly improve global governance. And promote world peace and stability.

  My thanks to the Asian Academy of International Law and its Foundation, as well as the Chinese Society of International Law, for once again organising this seminal international law event, for bringing prominent international legal professionals and speakers to Hong Kong to discuss the latest issues, concerns and promising developments in law.

  And while you're here, make good time to discover what the world city of Hong Kong has to offer – in arts, culture and entertainment, on our islands and coastal areas, our Michelin-starred restaurants, dim sum parlours, pubs, diners and cafes – all of them brimful of the best of East and West. Enjoy it all.

  I wish you all a rewarding Colloquium, and the best of legal business, and mediation, in the year to come.

  Thank you."

Nomination for 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections to begin on July 22,2025-07-04 10:00,2025-07-04 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070300758.htm,"The nomination period for the 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will run from July 22 (Tuesday) until August 4 (Monday).

 The By-elections will fill a total of 93 vacancies in the membership of the Election Committee (EC) to be returned by election involving 28 subsectors, while another 10 vacancies involving five subsectors to be returned by nomination will be filled through supplementary nominations by designated bodies (see Annex for details). The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) issued relevant gazette notices and uploaded relevant information to the election website (www.elections.gov.hk) for the By-elections today (July 4). If the number of validly nominated candidates for a subsector exceeds the number of EC members to be elected for that subsector at the By-elections, a poll for that subsector will be held on September 7.

 A spokesman for the REO said, ""A person nominated as a candidate (a nominated person) must be a registered geographical constituency elector aged 18 or above, who is a registered voter for the relevant subsector or has a substantial connection with that subsector. Details on the eligibility and disqualification in regard to nomination as a candidate and being elected as an EC member, and the requirements to be complied with by persons nominated as candidates, are set out in sections 17, 17A, 18, 18A, 19 and 20 of the Schedule to the Chief Executive Election Ordinance (Cap. 569).

 ""The nomination form for the By-elections must be subscribed by no fewer than five voters registered for the subsector concerned. Each voter may subscribe multiple nominations regarding a particular subsector but the number of candidates that each voter can nominate should not exceed the number of EC members to be elected by that subsector at the By-elections. In the case of a corporate voter, the subscription of the nomination form may only be effected by the corporate voter's authorised representative,"" the spokesman said.

 The Electoral Affairs Commission has appointed Returning Officers for relevant subsectors to receive nomination forms for their respective subsectors and to handle other electoral matters. The notice for the appointment of Returning Officers, with their office addresses, was also gazetted today and uploaded to the election website.

 The nomination forms may be obtained during ordinary business hours from 9am to 5pm on Mondays to Fridays and from 9am to noon on Saturdays (except public holidays) beginning today at the two offices of the REO (8/F, Treasury Building, 3 Tonkin Street West, Cheung Sha Wan, Kowloon, and Unit 2301-03, 23/F, Millennium City 6, 392 Kwun Tong Road, Kwun Tong, Kowloon), the offices of the Returning Officers of the relevant subsectors or any of the District Offices. The forms can also be downloaded from the election website.

 A nominated person must submit the completed nomination form and an election deposit of $1,000 in person to the respective Returning Officers during the abovementioned ordinary business hours (except public holidays) within the nomination period. The spokesman reminded those nominated persons that they may consider lodging the election deposit by Faster Payment System (FPS), which is newly introduced this year, or by cash and cashier orders as far as possible, to avoid any complications arising from a cheque not being honoured.

 ""The nominated persons are advised to submit their nomination forms as early as possible to allow time to correct mistakes, if any, in the forms before the nomination deadline,"" the spokesman said.

  Separately, the nominated persons must, in accordance with the requirements by the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee (CERC), complete and return the Eligibility Review Supplementary Information Form (SIF). The SIF is distributed together with the nomination forms and can be downloaded from the election website. The nominated persons shall put the completed SIF in a separate and sealed envelope and hand it in person together with the nomination form to the office of the Returning Officer within the nomination period for onward transmission to the CERC Secretariat. The nominated persons can also submit the completed SIF to the CERC Secretariat direct as soon as possible but no later than 5pm on August 4 through any of the following means:


email tocerc_secretariat@cerc.gov.hk;
fax to 2505 0673; or
return to the drop-in box of the CERC Secretariat at the entrance on 2/F, East Wing, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar, Hong Kong.


 Copies of the nomination forms of respective subsectors are available for public inspection at the offices of the Returning Officers during ordinary business hours after the start of the nomination period. Members of the public may also inspect copies of all the nomination forms at the REO office in Kwun Tong.

 For enquiries, please call the election hotline at 2891 1001."
