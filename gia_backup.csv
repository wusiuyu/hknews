再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-11-27 18:53,2025-11-27 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700694.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十一月二十七日）再接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案。中心呼籲家長盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名過往健康良好的兩歲女童。她於十一月二十五日出現發燒、嘔吐及糞便稀爛，昨日（十一月二十六日）被帶到基督教聯合醫院急症室求醫並入住該院，及後因休克及身體狀況轉差，轉到該院兒童深切治療部接受治療，現正獲安排轉到香港兒童醫院接受進一步治療，目前情況危殆。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型（H3）流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發休克、腦病變和多重器官衰竭。

女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗，於潛伏期內不曾外遊。她的一名家居接觸者近日曾出現呼吸道病徵，病況輕微，無需住院及已康復。

計及上述個案，今個夏季流感季節至今已錄得22宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括兩宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎11個月至17歲。若單單計算在本年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃展開後錄得的13宗個案，只有一人曾在發病前四天接種本年度季節性流感疫苗。然而接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，換言之，這些嚴重個案的兒童都未能受到疫苗保護。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然最新的監測數據顯示，流感活躍程度自十月下旬起逐漸下降，但仍高於基線水平。隨着天氣轉涼，不排除流感活躍程度仍可能會有反覆，加上明年初或會出現冬季流感季節，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿6個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。對比今年初冬季流感季節，今季兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案較多。目前，18歲以下兒童中，6個月至2歲以下兒童的覆蓋率相對偏低，只有近17%，希望各位家長不要遲疑，請盡快聯絡自己家庭醫生為子女，以至自己和其他家人安排接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

中心除了會因應流感的最新發展適時去信提醒醫護人員和學校外，亦會每周將最新的流感資訊上載網頁，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-27 18:45,2025-11-27 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700661.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十七日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得72宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

近期錄得的輸入個案中，有五名患者居於青衣。中心的流行病學調查顯示，他們在潛伏期及發病後在青衣北活動的範圍有重疊，主要包括青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。中心已把個案活動的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），進行控蚊滅蚊行動。中心亦正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，並對比其他本地及輸入個案，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。由於部分確診個案報稱，在青衣自然徑行山期間曾被蚊叮咬，中心認為青衣自然徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗，而過去四天中心未有接獲有病徵人士致電查詢。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-27 18:45,2025-11-27 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700668.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 27), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 72 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

 Among the recently recorded imported cases, five reside in Tsing Yi. The CHP's epidemiological investigation revealed that their activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The CHP has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the locations visited by the five patients for mosquito control operations. The CHP is also performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples, comparing them with other local and imported cases to determine whether these cases are linked. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have hiked in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area since November 1 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP has not received any enquiries from symptomatic individuals over the past four days. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Frederick (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Professor Frederick Ma), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Ciao. Good morning.

Thank you for observing a moment of silence with us together, for the 55 lives lost in a tragic fire that took place in Hong Kong yesterday. Our hearts and thoughts are with all the victims and their families. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is now doing as much as we can to help all those who are affected by this very unfortunate incident.

To officially begin this Symposium, may I first express our heartfelt thanks to the magnificent city of Milan - Italy's fast-beating economic heart, and one of the world's foremost fashion and design capitals, home of elegance, enterprise, for hosting this event. My thanks also go to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for putting this Symposium together.

A tale of two cities, two economies

For long, Hong Kong and Italy have much in common. We share a passion for creativity, craftsmanship, and elegance. Italian style has captured our hearts.

Our two cities are gateways connecting continents, blending Eastern and Western ingenuity. And we both thrive on openness, creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.

Our economic partnership is flourishing and remarkably diverse, too. In 2024, bilateral merchandise trade reached €7.2 billion. Some 200 Italian companies, from world-beating brands to leading players in banking, insurance, logistics and chocolate, have their regional headquarters, offices or operations in Hong Kong.

Think business, do business, with Hong Kong

Today's symposium is not just about thinking business. It's about doing business. Together.

We've brought with us an 80-strong delegation of Hong Kong business leaders spanning finance, innovation, technology, logistics, and the creative industries. I invite you to rise. Yes, they're here to explore opportunities with you, and to invite you to consider the vast possibilities Hong Kong, Asia's world city, can offer you.

For the next few minutes, allow me to explain why Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to be your long-term partner.

One country, two systems: our enduring strength

Hong Kong's unique strength is premised on our ""one country, two systems"" framework. It gives us the best of both worlds: seamless access to the Chinese Mainland's vast market, and unfettered connectivity with the world, with unparalleled opportunities for business and investment. We are a market economy upholding the common law system with a strong tradition of rule of law, a low and simple tax regime and business practices aligning with the highest international standards.

We are a free port, maintaining a free flow of goods, capital, information and people.

And the ""one country, two systems"" framework is here to stay for the long term, a position reiterated time and again by President Xi Jinping and affirmed at high-level state and party meetings in Beijing.

The rule of law is a defining feature of our city. Our judiciary exercises its powers independently, and the Court of Final Appeal sits in Hong Kong, with six non-permanent judges from overseas common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

Hong Kong also offers robust intellectual property protection. Our legal framework is fully compliant with WTO standards, and our High Court has specialist judges for IP cases. That makes Hong Kong a city you can count on to protect your innovations and creative work. And that, I know, is essential to Italian businesses, where design is both a profession and a passion.

Where Hong Kong stands today

The Hong Kong economy has, again, had a good year.

In international reports, Hong Kong continues to be ranked the world's freest economy, and we are consistently among the top three global financial centres. The IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook this year placed us third, globally. And all three major international credit rating agencies have reaffirmed our strong standing.

Hong Kong is also the gateway to the GBA - the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, a fast-growing, young and affluent market with an increasingly global outlook.

The GBA has a combined GDP of €1.8 trillion, a population of 87 million, and a per capita GDP of about €20,000. It is a vast and promising market for Italian goods and services, offering opportunities from luxury and lifestyle to technology and healthcare.

The Greater Bay Area is also a global leader in innovation and technology. This year, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou science and technology cluster was named the world's number one innovation cluster by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

These and other fundamental strengths make Hong Kong a prime springboard for Italian businesses eager to realise opportunities in China and across Asia.

Hong Kong: a leading IFC

Let me highlight a few areas that I believe will be particularly attractive to Italian businesses, starting with finance.

Hong Kong is one of the world's leading international financial centres. Some 70 of the world's top 100 banks and six of the top 10 global insurance companies operate in our city.

Our stock market, with a market capitalisation of €5.3 trillion, and the Hang Seng Index up by more than 25 per cent to date, is among the world's best performers this year.

We have a singular advantage: the ""Connect Schemes"" – that provide mutual-market access between Hong Kong and the Mainland. For international investors, it is a trusted avenue for accessing the Mainland's capital market. More than 70 per cent of China A-shares' foreign holdings, for example, were acquired through our Stock Connect Scheme.

Italian companies like Prada and Ferretti are already listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and I encourage more Italian companies to pursue dual listings on both Borsa Italiana and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Through our Southbound Connect, Italian companies can tap into Mainland liquidity, gaining a level of access no other international financial centre can provide.

We also invite Italian companies and banks to issue Renminbi bonds in Hong Kong. Our vibrant bond market offers multi-currency options, including USD, euro and RMB. Italian banks can use Hong Kong's Renminbi clearing and settlement system for trade settlement and other Renminbi-denominated financial transactions. That can only enable more efficient trade between Italy and China.

International innovation and technology hub

Hong Kong is also rapidly developing as an international hub for innovation and technology. We focus on four key areas: artificial intelligence, biotech, fintech, and new energy and new materials.

Our academic and research capabilities are world-class. Five of our universities are ranked among the global top 100. Three are ranked in the top 20 globally for AI and data science, and two of our medical schools are among the world's top 25.

We are now building a more complete innovation value chain, one that integrates basic research, commercialisation and advanced manufacturing. To that end, we are attracting strategic enterprises, either world leaders in their fields or companies engaged in cutting-edge technologies. Over the past three years, we have welcomed more than 100 strategic enterprises to Hong Kong, including four of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical companies. They are establishing R&D centres, expanding their operations in Hong Kong and investing in our shared future.

Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport welcome Italian start-ups and innovators. Our I&T centres provide a range of services, from incubation, funding, professional advisory to market development support.

The Northern Metropolis, an area bordering Shenzhen and covering one-third of Hong Kong's landmass, will be the heart of our I&T future. The San Tin Technopole, a cluster similar to the Milan Innovation District, will rise as one of its innovation hubs.

We are working closely with Shenzhen, in a co-operation zone along the border. Within that zone, Mainland capital, talent, goods, data and even biosamples will move freely to Hong Kong, giving companies access to both international and Mainland data, a significant advantage for artificial intelligence, bio and pharmaceutical companies looking to tap the vast Chinese market.

I invite Italian innovators and companies, particularly those in life sciences, precision engineering, advanced manufacturing, and luxury tech, to establish R&D centres and operations in this Northern Metropolis. There, they can collaborate with tech companies from Hong Kong and the Mainland, along with start-ups, universities and research institutions.

Culture and creativity

Finally, let me speak about culture and creativity, an area close to the Italian heart.

Hong Kong is Asia's cultural hub and a rising design hub. Our West Kowloon Cultural District has emerged as a world-class arts and cultural centre. It features M+ Museum, Asia's global museum of contemporary visual arts, design and architecture, as well as the Hong Kong Palace Museum, with more than 900 treasures from Beijing's Palace Museum.

Business of Design Week, or BODW, opening next Monday, has become Asia's most anticipated design event, bringing together creative minds from around the world to showcase their innovation and design excellence.

And we thank Italy for being so kind as the BODW's Partner Country again this year. Italian contributions to furniture design, textile innovation, the intersection of design with technology and sport, and much more will be featured at the Design Week.

Closing remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities there for us are both wide-ranging and far-reaching, whether you are in luxury goods, industrial design, fintech, biotech, healthcare, logistics or the creative industries.

Italian businesses can tap into Asia's dynamism through Hong Kong and our connectivity, financial services, innovation and cultural bridges.

You'll hear about that, and much more, in today's panel discussions and the plenary session beginning in just a few minutes.

Let us think business - and do business - together. Build a rewarding future. Together.

Grazie mille. Thank you very much."

The case involved three roller shutters at the front/rear doors and the removal of the protected lobby and wall separating the premises from the carpark of an industrial building at Shing Wan Road, Sha Tin. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owners were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (November 27), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

Special traffic and transport arrangements for No. 5 alarm fire in Tai Po,2025-11-27 04:46,2025-11-27 05:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700095.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (November 27) said that, due to the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented in the vicinity. Members of the public are urged to stay alert to the latest traffic news before travelling, plan ahead their journeys and reserve sufficient travelling time.

  A number of road sections in the affected area remained closed and motorists should opt for other roads. The TD anticipates that the traffic on Tai Po Road, Tolo Highway, Fanling Highway and roads in Tai Po town centre may be busier. Motorists are advised to avoid driving to the affected area.

  As for public transport, 39 daytime franchised bus routes travelling the closed road sections will be affected and diverted. The public should refer to the bus companies' website or mobile application for the latest information on the routes, and use railway services as far as possible.

  Franchised bus operators will deploy staff to major bus stops to assist affected passengers and maintain the on-site order. Standby vehicles and manpower have been reserved to meet passenger demand. MTR will enhance the frequency of the East Rail Line trains during the morning peak hours and deploy additional manpower to assist passengers at stations.

  A spokesman for the TD said that, under the co-ordination of the Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre, the TD has been working in concert with departments concerned to closely monitor the fire's impact on traffic and transport. The TD has been steering operators to gear up for response and service arrangements, with a view to minimising the impact to passengers' commute.

  The operation of the TD's Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre has been escalated and it will continue to operate round the clock to closely monitor the traffic and public transport conditions in the district. The Area Traffic Control Centre will adjust the timing of on-street traffic signals as needed to alleviate traffic congestion.

  The public should heed the latest traffic news through radio and TV broadcasts, the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk) and the HKeMobility mobile application before their journeys."
Government departments go all out to fight No. 5 alarm fire in Tai Po,2025-11-27 04:18,2025-11-27 04:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700078.htm,"A Government spokesman said today (November 27) that, in view of the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po that had caused multiple casualties, the Chief Executive convened an interdepartmental urgent meeting yesterday afternoon (November 26). The Government's Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre was activated immediately and officers from relevant departments closely monitored the situation in real time, co-ordinating efforts to strive to alleviate the impact of the fire.

Various government departments and units are making every effort on multiple fronts: the top priority is extinguishing the fire and rescuing trapped residents; the second is treating the injured; the third is providing postâincident support, offering assistance to the families of the deceased, the injured, and affected residents; and the fourth is conducting a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the fire.

The Fire Services Department (FSD) received reports at 2.51pm yesterday that a fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Fire services personnel arrived speedily at 2.56pm and discovered that the scaffolds outside the building had caught fire, and that the fire had spread to the interior and other buildings. Firefighting and rescue operations began immediately. The fire was upgraded several times and reached No. 5 alarm at 6.22pm yesterday.

Currently 11 jets and eight turntable ladders are deployed at the scene for water spraying, and 26 search and rescue teams are handling assistance calls at scene. During the operation, the FSD has dispatched over 200 fire appliances and about 100 ambulances, and mobilised over 1 200 fire and ambulance personnel.

Police officers immediately set up a command post upon arrival and mobilised over 1 000 personnel to co-ordinate residents' evacuation, rescue operations and emergency support.

Police officers also directed traffic at the scene and surrounding areas, implementing road closures, traffic control measures and diversions to facilitate rescue operations. Police will adjust road closure areas and special traffic arrangements as necessary taking into account rescue operations. Motorists are urged to exercise patience and follow instructions from officers at scene.

Moreover, a casualty enquiry hotline has been set up by the Police. If members of the public suspect their relatives or friends are missing in relation to the fire incident, please call the Police hotline on 1878 999.

During the operation, the Auxiliary Medical Service has deployed six ambulances and 33 personnel to provide on-site treatment and transport the injured to hospitals.

Upon notification by the FSD about the incident, the Hospital Authority immediately activated the Major Incident Control Centre to co-ordinate contingency measures, with the accident and emergency departmentsof nine public hospitals (including Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital, North District Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital, Pok Oi Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital and United Christian Hospital) having been alerted to standby to receive the casualties. Among them, the three acute hospitals in the New Territories East Cluster (i.e. Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital and North District Hospital) in the New Territories East Cluster along with their accident and emergency departments and other departments such as intensive care units and burn units, mobilised their full resources for rescue efforts.

Meanwhile, North District Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital also dispatched personnel to the incident site to help triage and provide initial treatment to patients. As the incident involved a number of patients, the burn centres of Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital, as well as the hyperbaric oxygen therapy centre of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, were prepared for the incident to receive patients anytime.  

In response to need for evacuation involving residents of Kwong Fuk Estate, staff members of the Housing Department and the management company concerned have provided assistance to residents on-site. The Housing Bureau and the Housing Department have also been maintaining close contact with the Home Affairs Department and the Social Welfare Department to provide full assistance to the affected residents, including arranging the residents of Wang Fuk Court and Kwong Fuk Estate in need to reside in transitional housing, interim housing or transit centres.

The Tai Po District Office (TPDO) has opened eight temporary shelters for residents in need and has arranged shuttle bus services for residents. As at 9.30pm yesterday, about 900 persons are using the shelters. The TPDO will continue to closely monitor the situation and open more shelters as necessary.

The TPDO has deployed all 19 Care Teams across the district to provide support, while the Sha Tin District Office (STDO) nearby and its Care Teams have also provided cross-district support. Care Teams in other districts will also be mobilised to provide appropriate support. The TPDO, STDO and North District Office have also set up interdepartmental help desks at Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Prince of Wales Hospital and North District Hospital to provide assistance and handle public enquiries. The TPDO will provide assistance to families of the deceased and injured in their applications for the Emergency Relief Fund or the Special Aid Fund, as well as liaise with various assistance funds operated by other charitable organisations.

The Social Welfare Department has deployed social work officers and supporting staff to the help desks and shelters for provision of assistance to the residents. Besides, the Civil Aid Service also mobilised over 100 personnel to assist with the operation of the temporary shelters. In addition, medical social workers are also providing emotional support to the injured persons and their families. Through liaison by the TPDO, the Hong Kong Red Cross deployed personnel to the temporary shelters to provide emotional support and medical assistance to people in need. The Health Bureau has also arranged for the ""18111 - Mental Health Support Hotline"" to step up its manpower to handle calls from people with needs for emotional support in relation to the fire. Moreover, support information on coping with stress or negative emotions has also been posted to ""Shall We Talk"" social media channels.

The Buildings Department (BD) has long been implementing strict requirements on the use of fire retardant protective nets, screens, tarpaulins, plastic sheeting and the like for scaffolds to prevent the spread of fire should a fire occur. Last month, the BD issued a circular letter to all registered building professionals and registered contractors, urging them to inspect and ascertain that the protective net and the like used in their construction projects are in compliance with the recognised standards in terms of fire retardant capability.

Wang Fuk Court is a sold property under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS). The works are carried out by Prestige Construction & Engineering Company, Limited, a registered contractor hired by the Incorporated Owners of the HOS court. The Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau (ICU) exercises building control over the works in accordance with the Buildings Ordinance. Regarding the fire incident, the ICU will conduct an investigation. If any violations of the requirements of the Buildings Ordinance are found, the case will be referred to the BD for handling in accordance with the ordinance, including prosecution or disciplinary proceedings.

In response to the fire incident, the BD and the ICU will also carry out special operations targeting ongoing construction projects. Registered building professionals and registered contractors will be required to review relevant records or test certificates relating to fire retardant properties of the protective nets and the like used in scaffolds, and submit their reports to the relevant departments.

As at midnight, the fire has resulted in 36 deaths and 36 injuries, including one fireman among the deceased. The FSD is making every effort to extinguish the fire, which is gradually under control. Staff from various government departments will continue to fulfil their duties diligently, fully engaging in response and relief work, as well as providing appropriate support to citizens in need."
行政長官探望大埔五級火警傷者和受影響居民後會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-11-27 03:57,2025-11-27 04:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700082.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十一月二十七日）聯同保安局局長鄧炳強、醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授、民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟和消防處處長楊恩健，在探望大埔五級火警傷者和受影響居民後會見傳媒。以下是他們會見傳媒的談話內容：

行政長官：對於昨日下午在大埔宏福苑發生的五級大火導致多人傷亡，我感到極度難過。到目前為止，這場大火已造成36人死亡，有279名人士失聯，仍然在醫院留醫有29人，其中七人危殆。我對死者致以深切哀悼，對死者家屬和傷者致以深切慰問，我們會提供一切可行的支援。

習近平主席對於今次的大火高度重視，第一時間了解火災救援和人員傷亡的情況，向我轉達他對遇難人員和殉職消防員的哀悼、對遇難者家屬和受災人員的慰問，並且要求中央港澳辦和香港中聯辦支持特區政府，全力以赴撲滅火災。我衷心感謝習近平主席的關心，亦感謝港澳辦和中聯辦向我提出會全力支持。

到目前，在消防人員的不斷努力之下，現場的情況逐漸受控。目前為止，消防處處長評估他們有足夠人手和能力控制並撲滅火災。我將會請消防處處長向大家講解這方面。

我今日到訪了大埔社區中心的臨時庇護中心，探望了疏散後到這個庇護中心的居民。庇護中心裏有86個家庭，共169人。庇護中心為他們服務的，包括醫生和護理人員、民政事務處的同事、社會福利署的人員、警務處的人員、紅十字會的一些緊急救護人士，亦有關愛隊。我探望他們的時候，其中有一對夫婦，丈夫七十多歲，他向我講述當時他的情況。他當時剛出門買東西，買東西回來就看到火災了。另外大約十多位進入庇護中心的人士，我也安慰他們，表示我們會提供所有他們希望的任何服務。稍後我會請麥美娟局長向大家講解這方面，我們支援有需要幫助人士的各種工作。

我極度重視今次事件，我已經指示政府各個部門和單位全力進行多方面的工作。首先的工作，最首要的工作就是撲滅這次火災和救援被困的居民。第二是救治傷者，第三是支援善後，接着，我們會做全面的調查。

在滅火和救援被困居民方面，消防處調動了共140多輛消防車和60多輛救護車，動員的消防員和救護員共800多人，也使用了無人機了解災場的情況。我指示了消防處動用所有需要的資源和人力，全速撲救這次大火。我也告訴消防處，政府所有資源都會全力支持今次撲滅火災的工作。現場的火勢逐步受控，現在有三棟樓宇從外看已經沒有火光，另外有四棟我們看到有零星的火光。稍後消防處處長會向大家講解他們撲滅這場火災所做的工作。

第二方面是救治傷者。醫管局已經啓動了重大事故控制中心，統籌和協調安排了九間公立醫院的急診室作出戒備。其中，新界東醫院聯網三間急症醫院，包括那打素醫院、威爾斯親王醫院、北區醫院，包括急診室和其他部門，例如深切治療、燒傷科等不同部門的同事都全力以赴進行救援。

北區醫院派出一隊醫療隊，威爾斯親王醫院亦派出一名醫療控制主任前往現場作分流及提供緊急治理。由於涉及多名燒傷傷者，瑪麗醫院和威爾斯親王醫院的燒傷中心及東區尤德夫人那打素醫院高壓氧治療中心都已經準備就緒，隨時接收受傷、需要診治的人員。我已經要求醫管局統籌，全力救治傷者。稍後我會請盧局長向大家講解救治的工作。

第三方面是支援善後，向死者家屬、傷者以及受影響的居民提供援助。大埔民政事務處已經開放了八個庇護中心，民政處也已經安排穿梭巴士接載居民，直至九時半，庇護中心使用的人數大約是900人。民政處會密切監察情況，按需要繼續開放更多的庇護中心。大埔區已經派出全區的關愛隊支援，也動員了沙田區的關愛隊，民安隊也動員了人手配合庇護中心的工作。大埔民政處和沙田民政處已經在那打素醫院、威爾斯親王醫院和北區醫院設立了跨部門的援助站，為受影響的居民提供協助。大埔民政處會協助有需要的死傷者家屬申請緊急救援基金或特別援助基金，亦會為他們聯絡其他慈善組織的各類援助基金。

社會福利署已即時安排社工和支援人員到現場救援站及各庇護中心，為居民提供協助。另外，醫務社工正為傷者及相關家屬提供情緒支援。經民政處聯絡，香港紅十字會亦已全面派員提供情緒支援及簡單醫療服務。稍後我會請麥美娟局長跟大家講解這方面的工作。

第四方面是全面調查事件，查出火警起因。警務處、消防處已經成立了專案小組全面調查。這件事件一定會提交給死因裁判法庭。

另外，房屋局獨立審查組會就建築物的外牆保護材料是否符合認可阻燃標準進行調查，採集樣本作化驗，如有任何情況，我們會依法、依規追究責任。

另外，屋宇署及房屋局獨立審查組會採取特別行動，針對正進行中的工程，要求註冊建築專業人士及承建商，全面覆核棚架保護網等用料符合阻燃性標準，提交報告。另外，屋宇署和房屋局會主動抽查地盤有關的保護幕和保護網是否符合安全要求，會抽樣進行測試。

這次的重大災難，政府會全面動員、全力以赴，向我剛才說的四個方向推展工作，首要的是將現場的大火全面控制，將它完全撲滅。現在我首先請盧局長說明一下醫治方面的工作。有請盧局長。

醫務衞生局局長：我報告一下關於醫院管理局（醫管局）在災難發生後，已啓動重大事故控制中心，同時動員醫管局九間有急症室的醫院作戒備，特別是新界東的三間醫院，包括威爾斯親王醫院、北區醫院和雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院作為重點收治病人，但後來因為病人數量較多，我們現時總共有九間醫院有收治病人。送入醫管局的病人共有37人，其中有四位搶救無效死亡，另外有四位輕傷病人在治療後已經出院，現時仍有29名病人在醫院內，其中七位危殆、13位仍然嚴重。他們大部分最嚴重的是吸入性氣道創傷，因為在火災中有許多熱空氣令其氣道受損，許多人需要在深切治療部靠呼吸機治療，另一些是燒傷，亦有個別病人一氧化碳中毒，因為在密閉空間內產生了一氧化碳，其中有一位病人已經轉送到東區醫院的高壓氧治療艙接受高壓氧治療，我們預計可能仍會有兩個病人需要同樣治療而要轉去東區醫院。

另一方面，我們亦啓動了有燒傷組或燒傷中心的醫院，包括瑪麗醫院、廣華醫院，它們都會在適當時候接收一些燒傷的病人作跟進治療。另一方面，除了照顧這些已入院的病人外，我們亦要照顧其他災民，很多災民都有一些醫療上的需要，特別是一些長者，他們未有攜帶隨身的藥物。我們在第一個臨時庇護中心，已經由雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院派遣醫護人員為他們處理，如果他們有藥物方面的需要，我們會適當地給予幫助。另一方面，我們看到庇護中心亦不止一個，我們現在交了給基層醫療署去統籌，不論公營和私營的一些醫護人員，我們都收到很多私營醫療機構提出自願加入提供支援，我們會由基層醫療署作協調統籌工作，務求令每一個庇護中心都會有醫療團隊作支援，為中心的災民提供適當的醫療服務。

另一方面，考慮到火災可能引致很多情緒方面的一些困擾、情緒方面的問題，我們亦已經指示18111「情緒通」熱線增加人手。在過去數小時，我們已經看到「情緒通」熱線收到的求助電話有明顯上升的趨勢，所以我們會加大人手，務求提供適切的支援給一些受到火災引起情緒困擾的病人及市民。市民如果受到災情影響，有情緒困擾或有壓力，亦可以在我們的「Shall We Talk」（「陪我講Shall We Talk」）社交網站找到一些關於情緒壓力的支援資料。我向大家的報告到此為止。

行政長官：剛才我也探望了在這所醫院的五位病人。有三位是燒傷的，有一位較為嚴重，燒傷了三成。我非常感謝醫院醫生和護理人員很悉心地照顧他們。他們做了手術，正在休息，所以我跟醫生了解他們的情況之後，我便不打擾他們了。另外有兩位應該是吸入了一些濃煙或很熱的空氣而需要療養。我也聽取了醫院總監向我匯報整體這次應急和醫治方面，整個系統的運作和他們配置的人手。他們很關心每一位病人，也很適切地對他們提供所有可行的幫助，所以非常感謝他們。

另外，我也會見了殉職消防員的家屬，對他們致以深切的慰問，也表示我們會全力提供任何可以幫助他們度過這個艱難時期的所有支援。消防處所有同事也對於殉職的消防員同事感到很難過，所以我除了鼓勵醫院各個醫護人員以外，我也提出，如果有其他需要，政府可以動用的資源，可以向我提出。接着，我請麥美娟局長和大家談談庇護中心的工作。

民政及青年事務局局長：我代表民青局（民政及青年事務局）和民政總署（民政事務總署）的團隊向死者的家屬和傷者致以最深切的慰問。我們知道這段時間大家非常徬徨，我們的團隊一定會陪着大家度過這段艱難的時間。這個時候大家會很徬徨，剛才特首表示現時已在大埔區開放八個臨時庇護中心，動用了全區19隊關愛隊，約200多人，另外我們亦動員了沙田區的關愛隊。這次重大事件，我們會動員全港十八區的關愛隊，因為其他區的關愛隊隊員都非常關心事件，希望可以出一分力，所以我們會動員全港十八區的關愛隊，為有需要的市民提供一切支援。另外，當區區議員和民政處同事亦在庇護中心當值，稍後我們會協助這些家庭申請緊急援助，其實有些家庭已做了登記。在過去幾小時，不斷有慈善團體、私人機構或公營機構向我們提出捐贈物資和捐款協助這些受影響的市民，我們會統籌這方面的工作，也會協助有需要的市民登記。

另外，我們也明白這次重大事件，市民在心理或精神上會有困擾，所以社署（社會福利署）的同事除了在庇護中心提供情緒支援，也會提供情緒支援的服務予當區市民。我們希望大家如果受到精神困擾，甚至可能你不是住在當區，如果你看到新聞，感受到精神困擾，請大家和我們聯絡，我們一定會向大家提供支援。

就短期的住宿問題，我們已聯同房屋局提供過渡性房屋，也有慈善機構，甚至酒店業界，還有民青局旗下的青年宿舍，我們會動用所有可動用的房間，為受影響的市民提供短期住宿安排。總而言之，我們一定會盡所有力量，動用所有可動用的資源，陪伴市民度過難關。

行政長官：接着，我請保安局局長和消防處處長談談在現場的火災撲滅工作和現時我們開展了調查工作的首階段發現。

保安局局長：首先，我要對殉職的消防人員、受傷人士和家屬致以深切哀悼和慰問。在這次行動中，除了消防同事外，我們亦出動了大約100名民安隊隊員，以及大約1 000名警務人員。警務人員的工作除了維持秩序外，亦協助疏散，還有維持交通，還有就着一些失聯人士和受傷人士設立一個調查小組。

消防同事在滅火和救援過程中，我們發現有關大廈外牆的保護網和保護膜、一些防水的帆布和一些塑膠布，它們受火後，其蔓延程度是遠比一些合規格的物料猛烈，蔓延速度亦較快，我們覺得這是不尋常的。另外，我們亦在沒有受波及的屋苑大廈中，發現有玻璃窗被貼上一些發泡膠板。這些發泡膠板當遇熱時會很容易蔓延，我們亦覺得這是不尋常的。就着這兩方面不尋常的情況，我們會作出深入調查。警方和消防處已組成一個聯合隊伍，除了就着火警方面作出調查外，亦會循刑事方向作出調查。至於救援詳情，我交由消防處處長補充。

消防處處長：我談談現在救火的情況。剛才行政長官也有提到，現在有七座樓宇牽涉當中，有一座沒有被波及。我們看到現在的情況，當中有三座樓宇（的火勢）已初步受到控制；有四座樓宇看到裏面還有零星火種。現在我們的同事正一步一步推進，大致已到達大部份樓宇的十七、十八樓。

現在現場有888名消防人員進行灌救，我們相信現在的消防力量足以應付。不過我們現在面對的困難是本身大廈樓宇面積有限，有一些樓宇我們已派駐20多輛車輛的消防人員入內進行灌救。你可以想像到樓宇面積不是很大，每層其實也有很多消防員，我們已經把面積可以容納的消防員人數投放下去。

還有，我們需要一層一層進行滅火，完成了一層，我們就會向上推進去做滅火、救援的工作。至於剛剛局長提到，我們在救火期間，甚至在一座未起火的樓宇發現窗戶的通風位置被發泡膠板封住。這些發泡膠板的易燃性很高和火勢蔓延得很快，所以我們覺得這些發泡膠板的出現不尋常，所以我們把事件交由警方作進一步調查是否有刑事成分。

暫時我們的救火過程是一步一步有進展的，我們希望盡快可以達至所以樓層都可以進行滅火和救援的工作。我的簡報到這裏。

記者：明白消防一直都很用心救援，但是由下午起火，到現時為止，火勢其實始終都是未撲滅，總體來說，救援進度都是不理想？剛才提到發泡膠和棚架方面，是否未有辦法確定起火成因是甚麼？

行政長官：在我交給消防處處長前，這些調查工作，第一，我們一定有全面的調查，亦要基於科學證據，但剛才保安局局長提出的一些疑點，警方已經決定展開刑事調查。我相信在這些火警中，需要做大量的實驗室工作，這方面我們可以投入的資源都會投入，確保調查加快，我亦很有信心，在消防處和警務處全情投入下，會盡快將每個可能調查的線索都完全跟進起來。接下來我請消防處處長講解一下救火工作。

消防處處長：謝謝行政長官。談到我們的進度，我們面對的困難是我們到達現場的時候發現有很多樓層起火。正如剛才所說，我們見到（火場）裏面有一些發泡膠，令到火警蔓延速度加快，而引致火種經過走廊燒進一些單位，裏面會產生一些濃煙和熱力，所以我們的同事要由地下一層一層去推進、去進行滅火、救援的行動。我們現在，正如我剛才所說，大部分的樓層已經去到十七、八樓，我們要慢慢地替換人手，一層一層地去推進滅火工作。

記者：會否考慮向內地部門包括消防尋求支援呢？因為有片段見到消防已在口岸準備，政府會否有甚麼顧慮？

行政長官：首先，我很感謝習近平主席對這件事件的高度重視，亦要求了中央港澳辦和中央政府駐香港聯絡辦公室，提供任何特區政府所需要的支援，我亦收到周邊城市領導的聯絡，他們很熱心，如果我們需要任何協助，他們都會提供。我亦在整個救火過程中，不斷與消防處處長就這些問題探討。基於現時我們對於現場的火災情況逐步受控，剛才都看到，有幾座已經在外面看不到火種，有些則看到零星。剛才處長告訴大家，相信不久的時間後就可以全面控制火場。這方面我很感謝周邊城市不同單位的熱心，希望盡量幫助我們，解決這次大家都是非常痛心的一場火災，我們很感謝他們。我亦對於消防處每一位消防員盡心盡力，撲滅這次火災，我很感謝他們的努力工作。

記者：國家主席習近平高度重視這次火災事件，第一時間了解火災救援和人員傷亡的情況。特區政府亦已經啓動了應急救援機制，目前特區政府如何跟中央各部門進行密切溝通，做好下一階段的救援工作？

行政長官：我今日不斷收到周邊城市領導人或救火單位的聯繫，我和消防處處長在討論救火方面進度時，起初的確看到火勢是很猛烈，消防處有系統地部署救火工作，現時火勢逐步受控。當然，每一位曾經接觸我的周邊城市領導或有關單位，我都會聯絡他們，將我們的現時情況告訴他們，他們都很關心。我們有其他需要，例如醫療方面，如有大量傷者，需要甚麼醫療設備，甚至其他工具，他們都很願意提供，我和他們會保持聯絡，我亦在此再次感謝內地不同政府部門對我們的支持，亦再次感謝習主席對這件事件的高度重視和關心。

記者：你好，想問因為今次受災的一些住戶相信都已經損失慘重，以及重新安置都可能需要一些時間，想問預計會用多少時間來對他們進行支援？以及例如給予相關撫恤金等方面預計會使用多少錢？重新安置方面需要多少時間？謝謝。

行政長官：我想現在最重要就是醫治和他們的住宿，這方面麥局長剛才已經交代我們整體在現有政府資源中，我們可以提供甚麼安排給他們。這方面我們會繼續加大力度，明天我都會舉行一個跨部門會議，將我們所有資源統整，將我們不同災民的需求，我們都會做一個清單，看看我們如何全面配合他們。我亦都多謝有很多善心人，聯絡我、不同局長、司長，他們很願意提供幫助，幫助受火災影響的居民。我們統整所有這方面的需求和我們的資源，盡量幫助他們。

長遠來說，要經歷今次這麼大的傷痛，我相信在心靈方面的支援都是很重要，我們會組織專家團隊看看這方面我們怎樣可以做到最能幫助每一位人士的需要。我們亦都知道有很多志願團體表示他們都會提供一志自願服務，我們會凝聚所有力量，大家共同幫助受影響的居民渡過這次難關。

記者：你好，火警是今天下午大約三時發生，但都見到很多政策部門在黃昏時段還在社交網站宣傳一些關於選舉事宜，想問當局覺得這個做法是否恰當？選舉會否因應這次事件延期？謝謝。

行政長官：我們已經暫停去宣傳和推廣選舉的工作，論壇亦會暫停。目前來說整個政府都會全程投入處理今次這宗大型災難事件，所以我們目前心中首要的工作就是處理好今次這宗事件，其他事情在我們統整好工作，幾日後再作決定。但我亦希望大家知道，我們做每一件事都是以香港整體利益為依歸，所以我們會作全面審視。選舉的確亦是我們一件重要的工作，但目前來說，最重要的工作就是處理好今次火災撲滅事件，以及我們之後對需要援助的災民提供最適切和最全面的幫助。多謝大家。"
政府各部門全力應對大埔五級火警,2025-11-27 03:21,2025-11-27 03:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112700063.htm,"政府發言人今日（十一月二十七日）表示，大埔宏福苑五級火警導致多人傷亡，行政長官昨日（十一月二十六日）下午召開跨部門緊急會議，即時啓動緊急事故監察及支援中心，由各相關部門人員實時密切監察情況，統籌協調各部門全力應對及處理火災造成的影響。

政府各個部門和單位全力進行多方面的工作：最首要的工作就是撲滅這次火災和救援被困的居民；第二方面是救治傷者；第三方面是支援善後，向死者家屬、傷者以及受影響的居民提供援助；第四方面是全面調查事件，查出火警起因。

消防處昨日下午二時五十一分收到報告指大埔宏福苑發生火警。消防人員迅速於下午二時五十六分到達現場後，發現外圍搭建棚架已起火並蔓延至室內及其他樓宇。消防人員隨即展開滅火救援工作，期間數度將火警升級，至昨晚六時二十二分將火警升為五級。

目前現場已動用11條消防喉、八部旋轉台鋼梯車在現場進行射水，另外26隊搜救隊正在現場處理求助個案。在今次行動中，消防處共調派200多架消防車輛及約100架救護車輛，一共出動1 200多名消防及救護人員。

警方到達火警現場後隨即設立指揮中心，動員超過1 000名警務人員協調居民疏散、救援及緊急支援的工作。

警務人員亦在現場及附近一帶指揮交通，實施封路、交通管制及改道措施，以協助現場救援工作。警方會因應救援工作需要適時調整封路範圍及特別交通安排。警方呼籲駕駛人士保持忍讓，並聽從現場警務人員的指示。

另外，警方已設立傷者查詢熱線，市民如懷疑親友在今次火警中失蹤，可致電警方熱線1878 999求助。

醫療輔助隊在本次行動中，已派出六輛救護車及33名人員，負責現場傷者的急救及送院工作。

醫院管理局收到消防處通知有關事故後，即時啓動重大事故控制中心，統籌及協調安排九間公立醫院（包括雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院、威爾斯親王醫院、北區醫院、伊利沙伯醫院、廣華醫院、博愛醫院、瑪嘉烈醫院、瑪麗醫院和基督教聯合醫院）的急症室作出戒備。其中新界東醫院聯網三間急症醫院（即雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院、威爾斯親王醫院和北區醫院），包括其急症室及其他部門例如深切治療科、燒傷科等不同部門的同事，均全力以赴進行救援。

北區醫院和威爾斯親王醫院亦派員前往事故現場為傷者作分流及提供緊急治理。由於涉及多名傷者，瑪麗醫院和威爾斯親王醫院的燒傷中心及東區尤德夫人那打素醫院高壓氧治療中心亦已做好準備，隨時接收傷者。

因應廣福邨有居民需要進行疏散，房屋署及管理公司的職員已在現場為居民提供所需協助。房屋局和房屋署已與民政事務總署及社會福利署緊密聯繫，盡全力為有需要的受影響住戶提供協助，包括安排有需要的宏福苑及廣福邨居民入住過渡性房屋、中轉屋或臨時收容中心。

大埔民政事務處（民政處）已開放八個臨時庇護中心供有需要居民暫住，並安排穿梭巴士接載居民。截至昨晚九時三十分，庇護中心的使用人數約900人。大埔民政處會密切監察情況，按需要陸續開放更多庇護中心。

大埔民政處已派出全區19隊關愛隊支援，鄰近的沙田民政處和關愛隊亦已跨區加強支援。另外，其他地區的關愛隊亦會動員作出適當支援。大埔民政處、沙田民政處和北區民政處已在雅麗氏何妙齡那打素醫院、威爾斯親王醫院和北區醫院設立跨部門援助站，為市民提供協助及供市民查詢。大埔民政處會協助有需要的死傷者家屬申請緊急救援基金或特別援助基金，亦會為他們聯絡其他慈善組織的各類援助基金。

Speech by FS at Hong Kong Association Luncheon in United Kingdom (English only),2025-11-27 00:30,2025-11-27 00:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/27/P2025112600868.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Association Luncheon in the United Kingdom on November 26 (London time):

Adrian (Chairman, Hong Kong Association, Mr Adrian Cartwright), Members of the Hong Kong Association, ladies and gentlemen, Friends of Hong Kong all,

  Good afternoon.

  Thank you for inviting me to once again to this welcome lunch.

  As English writer Douglas Adams once said, ""When people you greatly admire appear to be thinking deep thoughts, they probably are thinking about lunch."" Now that we are together, again, over lunch, let's move on to deeper thoughts.

  Starting with dinner. I trust you had a splendid evening at the Hong Kong Dinner last night Ì¶ good company, good conversation and just enough wine to encourage networking, but not enough to cloud your memory of it.

  This afternoon, I would like to speak about a subject central to Hong Kong's future: how we are reinventing Hong Kong and securing long-term economic growth through innovation and technology.

Innovation as an Economic Driver

  In Hong Kong, I&T is fast emerging as a cornerstone of our economic transformation. Over the past several years, we have invested more than £20 billion in I&T, underpinned by a comprehensive strategy that supports the entire innovation value chain.

  It helps that we are blessed with considerable strengths in basic research. Hong Kong is home to five universities ranked among the global top 100. Three are among the world's top 20 in artificial intelligence and data science, while both our medical schools rank in the top 25 globally.

  We know that research without commercialisation is a bit like inventing the lightbulb and forgetting to sell electricity. That is why we are focused on translating knowledge into usable, scalable innovation.

  To that end, we are attracting strategic enterprises to Hong Kong Ì¶ companies that bring capital, as well as jobs, international networks, and ambition. We've introduced a broad range of funding schemes to boost collaboration between academia, research institutions and industry. Because innovation thrives best when silos are dismantled and partnerships built.

  At last count, Hong Kong was home to nearly 4 700 start-ups, up a remarkable 40 per cent over the past five years. Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, our innovation flagships, continue to support start-ups and scale-ups, providing everything from incubation and funding to professional consultancy and market development. I should note that 28 per cent of our start-up founders are non-locals, with the UK our largest source of foreign founders.

Strategic Industries

  We are prioritising four strategic industries: artificial intelligence, biotechnology, fintech, and new energy and new materials. For the next few moments, allow me to elaborate on the first two: AI and biotech, where we are making tremendous strides.

Artificial Intelligence

  AI is no longer the future. It's here now, transforming industries and ways of life at an unprecedented scale and pace. In Hong Kong, we are taking a dual-pronged strategy. First, by nurturing AI as a core industry; and second, by embedding AI technology into traditional sectors to improve productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness. We call this approach ""AI+"".

  Our progress is built on six pillars: computing power, algorithms, data access, application development, capital investment, and talent cultivation.

  And there's more. Including the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, or Loop Area. There, Mainland and international data will converge, opening up unprecedented opportunities for data-driven innovation, including AI.

  Then there's the Greater Bay Area, which gives Hong Kong a geographic and strategic edge. It is the only region in the world where mechatronics and AI technologies coexist at scale. For companies looking to move from algorithm to application to deployment, the Greater Bay Area is the ideal testing ground. There, prototypes can be refined, validated, and scaled within a sophisticated supply chain.

  Hong Kong is also fast becoming a magnet for global AI talent. As Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, pointed out, roughly half the world's top AI researchers are ethnic Chinese. A good many of them are choosing Hong Kong as their base – for academic research, for commercial ventures, and for partnerships across Asia.

Biotechnology

  Turning to biotech, we are now developing a primary evaluation mechanism for drug approvals. This will allow Hong Kong to independently assess and approve medical products and devices. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is a game-changer.

  It will strengthen Hong Kong's role as a regional centre for medical research and clinical development. To support this transition, we are establishing the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation, and we have joined the International Council for Harmonisation as an observer. We are also investing in the infrastructure, systems and talent necessary to support the new regulatory regime. The plan is to begin phased implementation in 2026, with full rollout by 2030.

  And Hong Kong and Shenzhen have established cross-boundary clinical trial institutions in the Loop Area. These support studies complying with the standards and requirements of both jurisdictions.

  Already, major players like AstraZeneca and GSK have chosen Hong Kong as a base for R&D, while exploring opportunities in the Loop Area. For UK pharmaceutical firms and biotech ventures, this is a golden opportunity to gain direct access to Hong Kong, and to the vast Greater Bay Area, with its consumer population of some 87 million.

  We are also investing in the next generation of medical innovators. The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is establishing Hong Kong's third medical school, which will admit its first cohort in 2028/29. This will boost our supply of clinician-scientists. I'm confident, too, that it will attract top international faculty and students, deepening our role as a centre for medical education and translational research. The medical school will eventually relocate to the Northern Metropolis, alongside the area’s innovation clusters.

Capital for Innovation

  For that, and more, we need capital. Hong Kong's capital markets have undergone substantial reforms to enable easier listing for biotech, deep-tech, and innovation-driven companies. These reforms are already making a difference, allowing high-potential firms to raise growth capital from global investors.

  We've updated our listing rules to make it easier for biotech, hard-tech, and other strategic companies to go public in Hong Kong. Our goal is simple: to mobilise market funds that support their development.

  Beyond the public markets, Hong Kong boasts a dynamic private capital sector. Our private equity funds manage about US$230 billion in assets, second only to the Mainland in Asia.

  And, through the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, we are strategically investing in high-potential, high-risk and high-return ventures, particularly in hard tech. The Investment Corporation has, to date, invested in more than 150 projects, taking in over six dollars of private investment for every public dollar invested.

  The Corporation is also working closely with international partners to support commercialisation and global expansion. I invite British firms to explore co-investment opportunities, joint ventures, and technology partnerships through the Corporation. Innovation, after all, respects no borders; nor should investment strategies.

Northern Metropolis: Infrastructure for Innovation

  More than home to Hong Kong's third medical school, the Northern Metropolis will rise as Hong Kong's new economic engine and innovation and technology centre. We are fast-tracking its development through dedicated legislation and flexible land development initiatives.

  Three key anchors within the Northern Metropolis will, I believe, be of particular interest to British businesses and institutions.

  First is the Loop Area, which I've already mentioned. The zone is being designed to enable seamless collaboration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. That includes cross-boundary clinical trials and data flow from the Mainland to Hong Kong.

  Then there's the San Tin Technopole, which spans 210 hectares and is dedicated to high-end I&T development. Its outline plan has just been released. When fully realised, the Technopole is expected to contribute £25 billion annually to our GDP, generating 300 000 high-quality jobs.

  And third, the Northern Metropolis' University Town, which will cover some 90 hectares. University Town will attract top-tier local and international universities, encouraging collaboration between academia and industry, creating an environment where students, researchers and entrepreneurs work side by side, bridging theory and practice, classroom and commerce. And it will be where we advance the deep and integrated development of technology, education and talent.

  The Northern Metropolis is a project of scale, ambition, and purpose. We are building it to integrate technology, sustainability, and cross-boundary connectivity. And I would like to build it with you, with partners who share our vision, and our prodigious appetite for doing big things exceedingly well.

  I invite British construction, architecture, and engineering firms to take part in bringing to bright life this next-generation innovation corridor. And I also welcome UK universities, research institutions, and education partners to explore opportunities within University Town – and throughout this unprecedented innovation-driven development.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities Hong Kong presents are as diverse as they are substantial. For UK firms, businesses and academic institutions, this is your moment to engage. Whether in AI, biotech, advanced manufacturing, or other new tech areas, Hong Kong is where world-class ideas are inspired, funded and commercialised – across Asia and beyond.

  I look forward to welcoming you to Hong Kong, whether for business, pleasure or simply a well-earned break from the English weather.

  My thanks, once again, to the Hong Kong Association – to you all – for giving me this welcome opportunity to speak to you again. Over lunch.

  I'm now ready to take your questions.

  Thank you."

  Three key anchors within the Northern Metropolis will, I believe, be of particular interest to British businesses and institutions.

  First is the Loop Area, which I've already mentioned. The zone is being designed to enable seamless collaboration between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. That includes cross-boundary clinical trials and data flow from the Mainland to Hong Kong.

  Then there's the San Tin Technopole, which spans 210 hectares and is dedicated to high-end I&T development. Its outline plan has just been released. When fully realised, the Technopole is expected to contribute £25 billion annually to our GDP, generating 300 000 high-quality jobs.

  And third, the Northern Metropolis' University Town, which will cover some 90 hectares. University Town will attract top-tier local and international universities, encouraging collaboration between academia and industry, creating an environment where students, researchers and entrepreneurs work side by side, bridging theory and practice, classroom and commerce. And it will be where we advance the deep and integrated development of technology, education and talent.

  The Northern Metropolis is a project of scale, ambition, and purpose. We are building it to integrate technology, sustainability, and cross-boundary connectivity. And I would like to build it with you, with partners who share our vision, and our prodigious appetite for doing big things exceedingly well.

  I invite British construction, architecture, and engineering firms to take part in bringing to bright life this next-generation innovation corridor. And I also welcome UK universities, research institutions, and education partners to explore opportunities within University Town – and throughout this unprecedented innovation-driven development.

  Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities Hong Kong presents are as diverse as they are substantial. For UK firms, businesses and academic institutions, this is your moment to engage. Whether in AI, biotech, advanced manufacturing, or other new tech areas, Hong Kong is where world-class ideas are inspired, funded and commercialised – across Asia and beyond.

  I look forward to welcoming you to Hong Kong, whether for business, pleasure or simply a well-earned break from the English weather.

  My thanks, once again, to the Hong Kong Association – to you all – for giving me this welcome opportunity to speak to you again. Over lunch.

  I'm now ready to take your questions.

  Thank you."

The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today (November 26) hosted the second Joint Climate Finance Conference. The hybrid conference, which took place in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, brought together nearly 250 participants across both regions.

As the flagship initiative of the DFSA-HKMA partnership to support and enable climate finance in the Middle East and Asia, this year's conference focused on financial risks arising from climate change and innovation. It featured a series of dynamic discussions on how the two regions can leverage their strengths in finance and technology to collaborate on the development and deployment of innovative products and solutions, to facilitate energy transition and other sustainable development goals of the region and beyond.

The conference also provided a deep dive into the findings of the DFSA-HKMA joint research ""Scaling Sustainable Debt in Emerging Markets"", developed with knowledge partner BloombergNEF, on the role of sustainable debt in scaling up climate finance in emerging markets.

Supported by strategic partners including Dubai International Financial Centre Authority, Nasdaq Dubai, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, the conference featured distinguished speakers in business, commerce, and financial services from across the Asia Pacific and Middle East and North Africa regions. Their participation underscores the event's role as a premier platform for cross-industry dialogue, knowledge sharing, and collaboration on initiatives that drive long-term value and responsible investment in the region.

The Chief Executive of the DFSA, Mr Mark Steward,said, ""By combining our strengths as international financial centres, we are creating new pathways for sustainable investment and innovation. Tokenisation and other emerging technologies, which have been discussed in detail today, have the potential to make climate finance more transparent, efficient, and globally accessible - accelerating the transition across the Asia-Middle East corridor.""

Deputy Chief Executive of the HKMAMr Darryl Chansaid, ""Dubai and Hong Kong are in a unique position to facilitate climate action across Asia and the Middle East, enabling economies in the region to capture the growth opportunities created by technology advancement in green sectors. With the window for decisive action narrowing, we must move fast to bridge the gaps between markets, between capital and projects, and between ambition and execution. The HKMA and the DFSA will continue to provide a platform for the much-needed dialogue and collaboration.""

Malachite green is a type of industrial dye and has been used for treating infections in fish. Currently, malachite green has been prohibited for use in food-producing animals in many countries. According to the Harmful Substances in Food Regulations (Cap. 132AF), no food sold in Hong Kong is allowed to contain malachite green. Offenders will be prosecuted and liable to a fine of $50,000 and to imprisonment for six months upon conviction.

ã Since the patient stayed in the Chinese Mainland during his incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case is classified as imported. The CHP will report the case to the relevant health authorities in the Chinese Mainland.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 72 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

 Among the recently recorded imported cases, five reside in Tsing Yi. The CHP's epidemiological investigation revealed that their activities during the incubation and infectious periods overlapped in Tsing Yi North, primarily around Tsing Yi town centre and the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. The CHP has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the locations visited by the five patients for mosquito control operations. The CHP is also performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples, comparing them with other local and imported cases, to determine whether these cases are linked. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have hiked in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area since November 1 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP has not received any enquiries from symptomatic individuals over the past three days. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-26 19:45,2025-11-26 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/26/P2025112600700.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十六日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————
個案涉及一名69歲男子，居於東區。初步調查顯示，他於十一月十七日獨自到訪廣東省潮州市及汕頭市，在十一月二十二日回港當天出現發燒和關節痛，今日出現皮疹。他昨日（十一月二十五日）到柴灣家庭醫學診所求醫，正獲安排到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院醫院留醫，在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。他有一名家居接觸者，該名家居接觸者暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於病人在潛伏期曾到訪中國內地，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報中國內地的衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得72宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

近期錄得的輸入個案中，有五名患者居於青衣。中心的流行病學調查顯示，他們在潛伏期及發病後在青衣北活動的範圍有重疊，主要包括青衣市中心一帶及青衣自然徑附近。中心已把個案活動的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），進行控蚊滅蚊行動。中心亦正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，並對比其他本地及輸入個案，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。由於部分確診個案報稱，在青衣自然徑行山期間曾被蚊叮咬，中心認為青衣自然徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗，而過去三天中心未有接獲有病徵人士致電查詢。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
