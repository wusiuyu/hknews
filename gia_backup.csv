Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-23 20:12,2025-11-23 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/23/P2025112300630.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 23), the CHP has recorded two new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF).

Latest case information
-----------------------------

The first case involves a 69-year-old male living in Yuen Long District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Yunnan between November 9 and 16. He developed joint pain on November 20. He developed a fever on November 22 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pok Oi Hospital on the same day. He was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has one household contact and three other travel collaterals to Yunnan. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.
ã
The second case involves a 49-year-old female living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Zhuhai and Zhongshan in Guangdong between November 2 and 5. She developed a fever, joint pain and rash on November 21. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital yesterday (November 22) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. She is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient has three household contacts who are also travel collaterals to Guangdong Province. They are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

ããAs the two patients have visited CF-affected areas for travel during the incubation period, the CHP preliminarily considered that the case was infected during his travel. The cases are classified as imported. The CHP will report the cases to the relevant health authorities.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 70 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, four were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

The CHP has recently recorded several imported cases residing in Kwai Tsing District who had a travel history within approximately two weeks before onset of illness. The CHP is conducting in-depth investigations and analysis of the movements the cases during their incubation and infectious periods, and has notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the places they visited for anti-mosquito operations.
â
Preliminary investigations by the CHP revealed that some patients had been hiking in the area of Tsing Yi Nature Trails before onset. The CHP is performing genomic sequencing and analysis on patient samples to determine whether these cases are linked. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urges members of the public who have been hiking in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails area since November 1, and who subsequently develop relevant symptoms, to seek medical attention as soon as possible and call the enquiry hotline (2125 2373) previously set up by the CHP. The hotline will continue to operate daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP will assess symptomatic individuals and arrange blood tests if necessary. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:

read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-23 19:35,2025-11-23 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/23/P2025112300612.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十三日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

首宗個案涉及一名69歲男子，居於元朗區。他於十一月九至十六日到訪雲南，於十一月二十日出現關節痛，十一月二十二日出現發燒，同日到博愛醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。他的一名家居接觸者及三名同行到雲南的人士，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

第二宗個案涉及一名49歲女子，居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於十一月二至五日與到訪廣東省珠海市及中山市，她於十一月二十一日出現發燒、關節痛和皮疹，昨日（十一月二十二日）到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，獲安排留院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。她的三名家居接觸者（亦為同行到廣東省的人士）暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於兩宗個案在潛伏期曾前往受基孔肯雅熱影響的地方旅遊，中心初步認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，會把個案通報相關衞生當局。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得70宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，四宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

中心近日錄得數宗居於葵青區並在發病前約兩周內有旅遊史的輸入個案，中心正針對個案在潛伏期及傳染期的行蹤進行深入調查和分析，並已將他們曾經到訪的地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），以進行控蚊滅蚊行動。

中心的初步調查發現部分患者在發病前曾於青衣自然徑一帶行山。中心正就病人樣本進行基因排序及分析，以確定他們之間是否有關聯。為審慎起見，中心呼籲自十一月一日起曾在青衣自然徑一帶行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，須盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線（2125 2373），熱線會繼續每日由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心會為出現病徵人士進行評估，如有需要，會安排抽血化驗。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

​運輸及物流局局長出席「嘉里香港街馬2025」兩公里領袖跑起步禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-11-23 13:40,2025-11-23 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/23/P2025112300328.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十一月二十三日）出席「嘉里香港街馬2025」兩公里領袖跑起步禮的致辭全文：

今日風和日麗，是「全城街馬」的盛事，我感到很開心。剛才我在將軍澳主持10公里挑戰賽的起步禮，去年也在將軍澳參與了10公里精英賽的嗚槍儀式。這次很開心，特別多謝「全城街馬」的主辦單位，另外還有嘉里建設的冠名贊助，與路政署一起合作，趁着中九龍繞道（油麻地段）籌備得如火如荼，可以藉着參與全馬和半馬這個機會，讓跑手可以親身感受這個大型基建的工程。

說回這個基建項目，它的重要性不單是一條主幹道，還貫穿了九龍東、西，將活力十足的東九龍、啟德、觀塘以及九龍灣地帶連接到油麻地。西九龍是一個文化、旅遊及展覽的地點，希望大家稍後跑步時能夠領略到整段工程項目的幾個特色：包括「上天」的天橋、「下海」的海底隧道、「落地」的鑽探地底隧道，可讓大家看到隧道結構有不同分別。自二○一七年起工程開始建造，至今除了要建造項目本身之外，還要貫穿油麻地、佐敦、九龍灣及啟德的地段。大家都可以理解，附近有很多民居，特別我們要拆卸「汽車瓹山窿」的停車場，亦要重置油麻地玉器市場、公共圖書館以及母嬰健康院等。當中經歷了多達2 400次的地底爆破，但附近的民居卻不會受到影響，因為整個團隊利用謹慎和創新的工程方法，令每一次爆破可以在安全的情況下進行。另外，我們還創了一個紀錄，剛才KK（香港房屋協會主席凌嘉勤教授）也跟我說，他最初找這條走線極不容易，因為要在鬧市、有如此多公共設施下，能夠找到一條走線並橫跨了七條港鐵線，可見工程十分浩大及創新。我們希望可以利用基建項目，推崇大家投入運動及賽跑 。

繼今次籌備中九龍繞道（油麻地段）的「街馬」，希望明年更加努力，因我們正繼續努力興建茶果嶺隧道，是整個T2主幹路及六號幹線的重要一環，期望明年我們可以繼續和「全城街馬」合作。而今日則是中九龍繞道（油麻地段）開始公眾參與的揭幕，氣氛很好。

除此之外，立法會選舉亦踏入最後兩星期的衝刺階段。今日看到很多路政署團隊，相關部門包括消防處、土木工程拓展署，另外亦有顧問公司、工程師和營辦商代表，大家集結於此，正是一個很好的日子讓我們熱身，繼續推動全城氣氛以投入選舉。興建一個這麼大型的基建，需要得到立法會的撥款，與立法會建立互動關係非常重要。透過立法會選舉，我們希望能夠推動經濟發展、改善民生，為香港建立一個更美好的未來。1207（十二月七日），齊投票！多謝大家。"

Labour Department highly concerned about fatal work accident that happened in Sai Kung yesterday,2025-11-23 08:59,2025-11-23 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/23/P2025112300187.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) is highly concerned about a fatal work accident that happened at a construction in Sai Kung yesterday morning (November 22). In this accident, while a male worker was operating a concrete core drilling machine, his clothing was entangled by the cutting drill of the machine, causing his neck to be strangled by his clothing. He was certified dead later in hospital. The LD is saddened by the death of the worker and expresses its deepest sympathy to his family.

  The LD's spokesman said, ""We commenced an immediate on-site investigation as soon as we were notified of the accident and have issued suspension notices to the contractors concerned, suspending the use of concrete core drilling machines for concrete coring work on the site. The employer cannot resume the work process until the LD is satisfied that suitable measures to abate the relevant risks have been taken.""

  The spokesman added, ""We will complete the investigation as soon as possible to identify the cause of the accident, ascertain the liability of the duty holders and recommend improvement measures. We will take actions pursuant to the law if there is any violation of the work safety legislation.""
  
  To prevent workers from being entangled or injured by the cutting drills of concrete core drilling machines, the LD reminds employers to provide effective guarding to all dangerous parts (including cutting drills), and to ensure that workers do not wear loose clothing or accessories while operating the drilling machine.

  The general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance require employers to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years on conviction on indictment; or $3 million and imprisonment for six months on summary conviction.

  In regard to yesterday's accident, the LD will issue a Work Safety Alert through its mobile application ""OSH 2.0"", website and email, giving a brief account of the accident concerned to duty holders, workers' unions, professional bodies of safety practitioners and others, and reminding the industry of the importance of following safety precautionary measures to prevent a recurrence of similar accidents.

  The LD will also remind the employer concerned of the liability for employees' compensation under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, assist family members of the deceased to claim employees' compensation and closely follow up on the case. For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

  For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."

勞工處發言人說：「在得知意外發生後，本處已即時派員到意外現場展開調查。我們已向有關承建商發出『暫時停工通知書』，停止其在其地盤內使用混凝土鑽孔機進行鑽孔工作，直至我們信納有關僱主已採取適當的措施消除有關危害，才可復工。」

發言人續說：「本處正全速進行調查，以確定意外成因，查找有關持責者的法律責任，以及提出改善措施。若調查發現有違例事項，定會依法處理。」

為防止工人在操作混凝土鑽孔機時被鑽頭纏繞或所傷，勞工處提醒僱主須為混凝土鑽孔機的所有危險部件（包括鑽頭）加以有效防護，並確保工人操作鑽孔機時不得穿戴鬆身衣物或配置。

根據《職業安全及健康條例》的一般責任條款規定，僱主必須為其僱員提供安全的工作環境、作業裝置及工作系統。違反有關規定，循公訴程序定罪，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁兩年；或循簡易程序定罪，最高可被判罰款三百萬元及監禁六個月。

就昨日的意外，勞工處會於日內透過其「職安健 2.0」流動應用程式、網頁及電子郵件發放「職安警示」，通知持責者、工會和安全從業員專業組織等，簡介意外事故和提醒業界採取安全預防措施，以避免同類意外發生。

勞工處會敦促有關僱主必須履行《僱員補償條例》的補償責任，亦會協助死者家屬辦理工傷補償事宜，及密切跟進有關個案。對於有經濟困難的家庭，勞工處會協助他們申請合適的緊急援助基金。勞工處亦會因應家屬的需要及意願，就經濟或其他方面的援助聯絡社會福利署。

為了保障所有在工作中的僱員的安全及健康，勞工處呼籲僱主必須提供安全和不會危害健康的作業裝置及工作系統。僱員亦須與其僱主合作，遵守所有安全措施及適當使用所提供的個人防護裝備，避免危害自己及他人的工作安全。"
