Speech by SITI at Hong Kong Laureate Forum 2025 Gala Dinner (English only) (with photo),2025-11-08 19:40,2025-11-08 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800745.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at the Hong Kong Laureate Forum 2025 Gala Dinner today (November 8):

Professor Tong (Chairman of the Council of the Hong Kong Laureate Forum, Professor Timothy Tong), Dr Lam (Vice Chairman of Henderson Land Group and Director of Lee Shau Kee Foundation, Dr Colin Lam), esteemed Shaw Laureates, distinguished guests, young scientists, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good evening. It is a profound honour to join you tonight at the Gala Dinner of the Hong Kong Laureate Forum 2025.

 Over the past four days, we have witnessed a remarkable convergence of minds. The Hong Kong Laureate Forum has brought together brilliant Shaw Laureates and promising young scientists to share valuable insights in science and innovation.

 I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Council of the Hong Kong Laureate Forum, the Lee Shau Kee Foundation, and the Shaw Prize Foundation for their unwavering support and hard work. Their vision and dedication continue to inspire a global community committed to scientific research and breakthroughs. It is through gatherings like this that we plant the seeds of discovery which will shape the next generation and bring benefits to humankind.

 Hong Kong is proud to host this Forum, and proud to be a place where ideas take root and innovation flourishes. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has placed innovation and technology (I&T) at the core of our development strategy. We spare no effort to build a vibrant and sustainable I&T ecosystem that supports the chain of innovation - from fundamental research to industrial application.

 Just a few days ago, the International Institute for Management Development released its World Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025, placing Hong Kong fourth globally. This marks a steady ascent: three places higher than last year and another three from the year before. We are also excited to have five local universities ranked among the top 10 in the QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) University Rankings for Asia 2026 announced in the same week. These achievements reaffirm Hong Kong as a global hub for scientific excellence and world class talent.

 But we won't stop here. With the opening of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park later this year, alongside new I&T land in San Tin Technopole and Sandy Ridge situated in the Northern Metropolis, Hong Kong offers not just supportive policies and infrastructure, but abundant opportunities for I&T talent and enterprises. As a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"", Hong Kong is an ideal partner for global I&T collaboration and business explorations.

 To our esteemed Shaw Laureates: your accomplishments are a testament to the spirit of perseverance and adventurousness. As the saying goes, ""one minute on the stage takes ten years of practices off the stage (å°ä¸ä¸åéï¼å°ä¸åå¹´å)"". Behind every breakthrough lies decades of tireless quest for knowledge, unwavering determination, and steadfast belief in the power of science. We honour not only your achievements, but also the journey that made them possible.

 While the four-day programme of the Hong Kong Laureate Forum officially concludes tonight, the pursuit of scientific excellence continues. As we close this remarkable chapter, let us carry forward the spirit of the Forum to continue the dialogue, deepen the partnerships, and expand the horizons of possibility.

 And finally, a warm reminder to every eligible voter in Hong Kong: please cast your vote on December 7 at the Legislative Council Election to make your voice heard!

 Congratulations again on the resounding success of the Hong Kong Laureate Forum 2025. I wish you all a pleasant evening. Thank you."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-08 18:30,2025-11-08 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800701.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 8), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 59 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, three were local cases and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
--------------------------------------------------------------

 In light of a locally acquired case recorded in Kwai Tsing District earlier this week, the CHP conducted a risk assessment and collaborated with relevant District Services & Community Care Teams to distribute leaflets on CF prevention to over 10 000 households in Mount Haven and the surrounding areas, Kwai Chung Plaza, Shun Tak Centre in Sheung Wan and the vicinity to remind residents to monitor for relevant symptoms and maintain good environmental hygiene at home.

 From November 3 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 13 000 individuals residing or working in higher-risk districts through health consultation booths, along with its inquiry hotline, door-to-door visits and questionnaire surveys conducted in the districts concerned. The CHP has arranged blood tests for a total of 14 persons who had mild symptoms and all were tested negative. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past one day. The health consultation booths located at Cheung Hang Community Hall in Tsing Yi and Kwai Fong Estate (near Kwai Ming House) will continue to provide assessments for the citizens in the districts daily from 9am to 1pm. The previously established inquiry hotline (2125 2373) will also continue to operate daily from 9am to 6pm.

TheFood and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
 The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
CS attends press conference on preparations for 15th National Games in Guangzhou,2025-11-08 18:07,2025-11-08 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800670.htm,"Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th National Games (NG) and Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, attended a press conference on preparations for the 15th National Games (NG) held by the Organising Committee of the 15th NG in Guangzhou today (November 8). Mr Chan, along with relevant officials from the General Administration of Sport of China, Guangdong Province and the Macao Special Administrative Region, introduced the progress of the preparations for the 15th NG.

  Addressing the press conference, Mr Chan said the NG this year is of extraordinary significance as it is jointly hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao for the first time. It fully reflects the country's high level of trust and expectations for Hong Kong, and demonstrates the enormous potential and promising prospects of co-ordinated sports development in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), injecting new momentum and energy into promoting developments in the GBA and facilitating high-quality regional development.

  On how the Games would promote Hong Kong's economic development and consolidate its status as a hub for international mega events, Mr Chan said that the 15th NG this year is the largest NG in history. It is expected that there will be nearly 4 000 people in total participating in the games in Hong Kong, including over 2 100 athletes and over 1 800 officials and technical officials. In addition, hundreds of media representatives will also come to Hong Kong to cover the games. Mr Chan said he believes that the games will attract a large number of visitors to watch the games in Hong Kong, experiencing the city's charm and passion for sports.

  Mr Chan said, ""Through organising the NG, Hong Kong showcases the city's capability to organise large-scale competitions. It further solidifies Hong Kong's reputation as an international capital of mega events, laying a solid foundation for attracting more premier sports events to be held in Hong Kong in the future. In addition, organising large-scale sports events will leverage the 'sports plus tourism' synergistic effect to drive the development of tourism, hotel, retail, and food and beverage industries. As more tourists from the Mainland and overseas are attracted to Hong Kong to enjoy the games and visit other GBA cities, it brings long-term benefits to the tourism trade and creates more collaboration opportunities in the GBA.""

  Regarding the arrangements of the cross-boundary road cycling event, Mr Chan said, ""As the first-ever cross-boundary event in the history of the NG, it highlights the unique feature of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao cohosting the NG. To ensure the smooth implementation of the event, the three places have maintained close liaison to create a smooth and convenient cross-border clearance experience through advanced technologies and effective collaboration mechanisms, achieving the goal of 'contactless clearance'.""

  He noted that an innovative mode of ""pre-entry clearance and closed-loop management"" is adopted for the event, conducting advance identity verification of relevant personnel, with a view to facilitating their entry to the closed-loop area and immigration clearance. During the event, athletes will wear wristbands with a global positioning system and equipment of radio frequency identification. Live broadcast monitoring and drone inspection systems will be equipped along the race course to keep track of the real-time movements and locations of all participants. In addition, athletes and equipment vehicles will be bound with magnetic chips, allowing efficient transmission of clearance information to the backend system, delivering a ""contactless clearance"" with zero delay, zero waiting time, and uninterrupted passage without stopping.

  He further stated that throughout the preparation and organisation process, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao have maintained close communication. This includes visits to cross-boundary routes and co-ordination among relevant departments and units for several working meetings. The governments of the three places have engaged in substantial and meticulous co-ordination across various areas, such as managing road closures, implementing temporary control measures at control points, ensuring closed-loop arrangements throughout the events, providing motorcade escorts, ""contactless clearance"", and preventing race convoys and athletes from deviating off course. This cross-boundary collaboration mode not only ensures the smooth execution of the event but also fosters people-to-people exchanges in the GBA, deepens regional co-operation mechanisms, and enhances the GBA's overall capabilities comprehensively in holding large-scale competitions. It also provides practical opportunities and lays a solid foundation for future co-operation in the GBA.

  Mr Chan said, ""By hosting the 15th NG, Hong Kong and other cities in the GBA can build closer sports partnerships, further break down geographical boundaries, achieve resource sharing and complementary advantages, and jointly advance the development of the sports industry of the GBA. This will attract more large-scale international sports events to Hong Kong and the GBA, continuously enhancing the region's global influence and sports competitiveness.""

  Officials attending today's press conference included Deputy Director of the General Administration of Sport of China Mr Li Jing; Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG and Standing Committee member of the CPC Guangdong Provincial Committee, Mr Wang Xi; Mr Chan; and Vice President of the Organising Committee of the 15th NG and Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture of the Macao Special Administrative Region Government, Ms O Lam.

  Mr Chan will attend the second plenary meeting of the Organising Committee and the second meeting of heads of delegations tomorrow (November 9)."

陳國基在會上指出，本屆全國運動會（全運會）首次由粵港澳三地共同舉辦，意義非凡。這充分體現了國家對香港的高度信任和重託，也展現出粵港澳大灣區體育事業協同發展的巨大潛力和廣闊前景，為推進大灣區建設、促進區域高質量發展注入新動能與活力。
 
就舉辦全運會如何促進香港經濟發展、鞏固香港作為國際盛事之都的地位，陳國基說，今年的十五運會是歷屆規模最大，比賽期間預計將有2 100多名運動員及1 800多名官員及技術官員，合共近4 000人參與香港賽區賽事；另有數百名傳媒代表來港採訪。他相信賽事將吸引大批旅客來港觀賽，親身感受香港的體育熱情與城市魅力。 

他說：「透過舉辦全運會，香港不僅展示出承辦大型賽事的能力，更進一步鞏固香港作為國際盛事之都的地位，為未來吸引更多頂級體育盛事落戶香港奠定堅實基礎。同時，舉辦大型體育盛事將發揮『體育＋旅遊』的聯動效應，帶動旅遊、酒店、零售及餐飲等多個行業發展，吸引更多海內外遊客來港觀賞賽事，並同時遊覽大灣區其他城市，為旅遊業帶來長遠效益，亦為大灣區創造更多合作機會。」 

有關跨境公路自行車比賽安排，陳國基說：「比賽是全運會歷史上首次以跨境形式進行，充分展現出粵港澳三地共同承辦本屆全運會的特色。為保障賽事順利進行，粵港澳三方緊密協商，通過先進科技與高效協作機制，全力打造順暢、便捷的跨境通關體驗，實現『無感通關』的目標」。

他指出，賽事採取「前置通關查驗＋閉環管理」的創新模式，透過預先核實相關人員的身分資料，便利他們在賽事期間進入閉環區和出入境。比賽期間，運動員戴上全球定位系統手環，並配備無線射頻識別系統設備；同時，賽道沿線亦設有直播監控及無人機視察系統，實時掌握所有參賽人員的動態與位置。另外，運動員和物資車輛均綁定磁片，令通關信息快速傳輸到後台，實現零延時、零等待、不踩剎車的「無感通關」體驗。 

他續說，籌辦過程中，粵港澳三地一直保持緊密交流，包括視察跨境賽事路線，以及統籌各相關部門和單位召開多次工作會議等，針對封路安排、關口臨時管控、賽事期間閉環管理、沿途車隊護送、「無感通關」、避免車隊和運動員偏離賽道等多個範疇，三地政府進行了大量細緻的協調工作。這種跨地域的合作模式，不僅確保賽事能夠順利舉行，更有助於促進大灣區民心交流，深化區域合作機制，全面提升整體舉辦大型賽事的能力，也為大灣區的未來合作提供了實踐機會，奠定穩固的基礎。

陳國基說：「通過舉辦本屆全運會，香港與大灣區其他城市能夠建立更緊密的體育合作關係，進一步打破地域界限，實現資源共享、優勢互補，共同推進大灣區體育事業的發展，吸引更多大型國際體育賽事落戶香港和大灣區，持續提升區域的國際影響力和體育競技水平。」

SED attends sharing session for new Belt and Road Scholarship awardees (with photos),2025-11-08 17:55,2025-11-08 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800325.htm,"âThe Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, attended an annual sharing session for new Belt and Road(B&R)Scholarship recipients today (November 8) with over 100 new B&R Scholarship awardees for the 2025/26 academic year.

The Education Bureau (EDB) has been organising annual sharing sessions for new awardees since the 2024/25 academic year, with a view to helping them learn about different opportunities in Hong Kong and establish a platform for mutual support. By inviting past awardees to share their experiences of staying in Hong Kong for development after graduation, new awardees are encouraged to do so.

Speaking at the sharing session, Dr Choi said that the EDB is committed to attracting more international students, particularly those from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and B&R countries/regions, to study in Hong Kong. The annual quota for the scholarship has been increased to 150, allowing more outstanding students to experience the unique blend of East meets West that Hong Kong offers. The EDB is determined to foster a more international campus environment, where students from different places can learn and grow together to gain diverse learning experience, and become good friends with their counterparts from other places to broaden network.

The Commissioner for Belt and Road, Mr Nicholas Ho, also attended the sharing session. During the session, an awardee of the B&R Scholarship who had graduated shared that the scholarship allowed recipients to pursue advanced studies at world-class universities in Hong Kong, much like stepping onto the world stage, and that receiving the scholarship not only broadened their horizons, but also brought endless opportunities.

The Government introduced the B&R Scholarship in the 2016/17 academic year to encourage students from B&R countries/regions to pursue their studies in Hong Kong. Since its launch, the B&R Scholarship has been well received by outstanding students from B&R countries/regions and participating local universities. Up to the 2025/26 academic year, over 830 students from 57 B&R countries/regions have been awarded the scholarship."

A 18-year-old male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cocaine, weighing about 5.8kg, concealed inside three plush toys in his carry-on suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

After an investigation, the arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, and the case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on November 10.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

  This exhibition in Kuala Lumpur represents a continued effort by CCIDA in sponsoring the industry to showcase Hong Kong original art toys in Southeast Asia following large-scale art toy exhibitions in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2022 and in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2024. The two exhibitions in Bangkok and Jakarta successfully attracted attention from toy lovers in the two countries, and brought more than 250 business enquiries in total to the participating Hong Kong designers. Some were approached by local agents to import their art toys or hold solo exhibitions, which assisted Hong Kong original art toys to further penetrate the markets of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

The ""Hong Kong Art Toy Story 2025@Kuala Lumpur"" exhibition is also supported by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, Jakarta. Its Director-General, Miss Libera Cheng, also attended the opening ceremony.

Among the 12 Hong Kong designers displaying their signature works in the exhibition, six of them have new creations that cross over with Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage for this overseas debut.

Sponsored by CCIDA, the ""Hong Kong Art Toy Story"" series is organised by the Innovative Enterpreneur Association. In addition to holding large-scale Hong Kong original art toy exhibitions in various overseas markets for promotion and exploring business opportunities, the project has set up a Hong Kong Pavilion at the annual Thailand Toy Expo since 2023 to facilitate the display and sales of original art toys by Hong Kong designers. The Hong Kong Pavilion has become a highlight of the Thailand Toy Expo, attracting tens of thousands of toy fans and visitors from different countries, bringing several million Hong Kong dollars worth of sales to the participating Hong Kong designers over the years.

As promulgated in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, CCIDA will proactively assist Hong Kong designers in creating more cultural and creative products with Chinese and Hong Kong features, and will strengthen support for local original works to enter the Chinese Mainland and international markets."

各位媒體朋友：

​大家好！第十五屆全國運動會，歷史上首次由粵港澳三地攜手聯合主辦，格局宏大，影響深遠。這不僅是中央對香港的充分肯定與殷切寄望，更是粵港澳大灣區融合發展的一次全面展現。

​這場體育盛事，必將為大灣區的建設與高質量發展，注入全新的動力。同時，這也標誌着香港在融入國家發展大局的進程中邁出關鍵一步，是「一國兩制」成功實踐的生動體現。對廣大香港市民，尤其是青年一代而言，這更是一堂寶貴的國民教育課，讓大家親身感受國家榮耀，深化對國家的歸屬感與自豪感。

所以，香港特別行政區（特區）政府一直高度重視十五運會的籌備工作。在過去兩年多以來，我們全力推進各項準備，確保整個賽事能夠順利、圓滿地舉行。

香港特區政府早在二○二三年五月，就成立了十五運會香港特區賽區籌備委員會（籌委會），由行政長官親自監督，我擔任主席，文化體育及旅遊局局長擔任秘書長，全面負責督導香港承辦十五運會的相關工作。籌委會之下還成立了督導委員會，密切監督和統籌各政策局及部門的籌備進展，定期檢視各階段工作進度，確保每一項任務都落實到位。

我們也於二○二三年十月成立全國運動會（全運會）香港賽區統籌辦公室，負責全面落實籌備委員會和督導委員會所敲定的各項政策，並與各界持份者保持緊密聯繫與合作，積極推展和執行各項具體籌辦工作。

香港特區政府一直與國家體育總局、廣東省政府及澳門特區政府保持緊密溝通，透過常態化聯絡機制，定期就賽事籌辦工作召開會議，確保信息暢通、協調一致。我們也積極與內地各個體育協會協調賽事細節及場地安排，並邀請他們參與香港賽區的測試賽，為後續的正式賽事打下堅實基礎。

香港一直秉持「綠色、共享、開放、廉潔」的辦賽理念，嚴格遵循「簡約、安全、精彩」的辦賽要求，以最高標準推進每一項籌辦任務。目前各競賽場館已經全面準備就緒，我們也制訂了詳細的安保計劃、人群和交通管理安排及應變預案，確保賽事全程順利、安全進行。

賽事進行期間，香港賽區賽事指揮中心將全程監察各項運行數據，統一調度，並與十五運會賽事指揮中心保持聯繫。各個比賽場館也分別設立了場館指揮中心，確保場館運作和賽事執行順暢無阻。

上星期天，香港與廣州、深圳和澳門以四城聯動的創新模式，順利完成了十五運會火炬傳遞活動。這是全運會歷史上首次四地同步開展火炬傳遞，也是全運會火炬首次在香港傳遞，對香港來說意義十分重大。

香港市民能夠親眼見證火炬傳遞，不僅增強了他們對國家和中華民族的自豪感，傳遞了愛國精神，也進一步提升了他們對十五運會的關注和認識，進一步宣揚「全民全運，同心同行」的理念。

香港賽區的首兩個競賽項目，沙灘排球和男子手球，分別於十月三十一日和十一月一日展開。賽事正進行得如火如荼，沙灘排球已完成了120場賽事，今晚將誕生香港賽區的第一面金牌。男子手球賽事方面，至今已完成了25場賽事，決賽將於兩天後的十一月十日舉行。

這兩項賽事都受到市民廣泛歡迎，不少市民購票入場，親身支持運動員，現場氣氛非常熱烈。男子22歲以下組的籃球比賽也將於十一月十日展開，三個項目累計已經有超過630位運動員和技術官員抵達香港。

明天開幕式之後，還將有更多精彩競賽項目在香港賽區陸續展開，包括七人制橄欖球、高爾夫球、場地自行車、鐵人三項和擊劍。香港將一共上演超過100場精彩賽事，合共誕生38面金牌。當然還有兩項首次在全運會舉辦的跨境項目——今天早上舉行的公路自行車比賽，以及下星期六的田徑馬拉松比賽。

香港市民可以親臨現場觀賽，見證香港運動員與全國精英同場競技，不僅有助推動香港體育事業發展，促進本地精英運動員與內地隊伍交流學習、提升競技水平，更能激發廣大市民參與體育運動的熱情，為香港創造更多參與高水平體育活動的機會，鼓勵更多有潛質的年輕人投身運動員行列。

全運會不僅是一場體育盛事，更是促進文化交融與經濟協作的重要平台。香港將以此為契機，進一步深化與廣東、澳門的緊密協作，攜手開創大灣區體育產業和文化交流的新格局，貢獻大灣區的高質量發展，將香港的獨特優勢，有機結合到國家現代化建設的宏偉藍圖中，共同譜寫新時代的香港故事、灣區故事與中國故事。

明天就是十五運會正式開幕的大日子，我在這裏衷心祝願本屆全運會取得圓滿成功！謝謝大家！"

Organ Donation Day 2025 promotional event held today to encourage public to register as organ donors (with photos),2025-11-08 16:20,2025-11-08 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110700796.htm," The Health Bureau, the Department of Health (DH) and Radio Television Hong Kong co-organised an event today (November 8) to promotethe Organ Donation Day 2025. By honouring and showcasing the outstanding achievements of organ transplant recipients in international sports events, the event aims to encourage the public to embrace the spirit of generosity by actively supporting and registering as organ donors, to rekindle hope for patients urgently awaiting organ transplants.

 Officiating and delivering a speech at the event, the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""Despite the rapid advancement in medical technology nowadays, for some patients with organ failure, organ transplant remains the only hope to live on. Due to limited supply from donations of transplantable organs, many patients are struggling to battle theirdiseases every day, with some of them having passed away while waiting for suitable organs. Therefore, I appeal to members of the public to actively support organ donation by registering your wishes in the Centralised Organ Donation Register (CODR) now and informing your family members. This is crucial in shortening patients' waiting time for organ transplants. Your decision can bring hopes for a new lease of life to patients waiting for organ transplant and their families.""

 Other officiating guests included the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; the Acting Deputy Director of Broadcasting, Mr Vincent Lee; and the Chief Executive of the Hospital Authority, Dr Libby Lee. Representatives from various organisations actively promoting organ donationalso attended the event to support Organ Donation Day.

 At the event, two organ transplant recipients who won awards at the 25th World Transplant Games in August this year shared their unforgettable experiences at the games. Their stories enabled the audience to witness not only their joy but also their perseverance in honouring the donors' generous spirit through hard-earned medals. Organ Donation Day 2025ambassadors Ms Michelle Wai and Mr Cheung Siu-lun also voiced their support for organ donation to more than 200 attendees.

 Besides sharing sessions, multiple organ transplant recipients teamed up with event hosts, university students and artistes in two groups to compete in three matches of pickleball, bowling and rhythmic fitness to showcase their skills. This allowed the public to witness how organ donation transforms recipients' lives, enabling them to restore their precious health and empowering them to continue contributing to society.

  The Government has been working closely with community partners to promote organ donation and raise public awareness. Since its launch in 2016, more than 600 enterprises, organisations and schools have joined the Organ Donation Promotion Charter. In 2023, the CODR system was enhanced to facilitate the public to conveniently register or check their registration status via the ""iAM Smart"" mobile application, enhancing efficiency in identity authentication. This year, the DH has set up over 2 000 promotional booths across 18 districts in government or statutory bodies' buildings, exhibitions, educational institutions, hospitals, District Health Centres, and other venues, and organised 10 health talks and train-the-trainer workshops. With ongoing publicity and promotional efforts through a multi-pronged approach, the number of registrations in the CODR has been steadily increasing in recent years, reaching a record-high of over 410 000.

 In Hong Kong, more than 2 000 patients and their families are still waiting in despair. The DH rolled out a new round of organ donation promotional campaign last month. From October 23 to December 3, theOrgan Donation Promotion Vehiclewill travel to various districts in Hong Kong, to remind the public of the ""3Ss"" motto of organ donation: to register their wishes in the CODR (Sign up), inform family members (Speak out), and advocate for organ donation among relatives and friends (Spread out). Members of the public can register for organ donation at the spot. Details of vehicle parking locations are available on the thematic website (www.organdonation.gov.hk/en/promotional_activities.html). Members of the public may also register through the CODR website (www.codr.gov.hk), or mail/fax application forms to the CODR Office.

USITI and DC attend World Internet Conference Wuzhen Summit (with photos),2025-11-08 16:20,2025-11-08 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110700596.htm,"  The Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Ms Lillian Cheong, and the Deputy Commissioner (Digital Infrastructure), Mr Daniel Cheung, attended the Cross-Strait, Hong Kong and Macao Internet Development Forum, the Cybersecurity Forum for Technology Development and International Cooperation, and the Data Governance Forum of the 2025 World Internet Conference (WIC) Wuzhen Summit held in Hangzhou today (November 8) respectively and exchanged views with representatives of government institutions, international organisations, enterprises and research institutes from various places on Hong Kong's latest developments in innovation and technology (I&T). The Summit, with the theme ""Forging an Open, Cooperative, Secure, and Inclusive Digital Future - Building a Community with a Shared Future in Cyberspace"", is hosted by the WIC.

  Addressing the Cross-Strait, Hong Kong and Macao Internet Development Forum today, Ms Cheong shared the latest overview of the promotion of the AI development in Hong Kong. She said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is striving to cultivate a vibrant AI ecosystem. To advance the ""AI+"" development, the HKSAR Government proposed in this year's Policy Address to step up the promotion of AI as a core industry for Hong Kong's future development, guided by the strategy of ""strengthening infrastructure and promoting the application-oriented approach"" to create new quality productive forces for Hong Kong in the era of digital economy.

  Ms Cheong pointed out that the HKSAR Government has been adopting an all-rounded approach to support the development of the AI industry by supporting innovative research and development (R&D), uplifting computing infrastructure, actively implementing the open data policy and channelling market capital to invest in emerging and future industries of strategic importance including AI. She added that the establishment of the AI Efficacy Enhancement Team was also proposed in this year's Policy Address to co-ordinate and steer government departments in the effective use of AI technology, with a view to achieving ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"" in better alignment with the national ""AI+"" Initiative, so as to develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) into a global highland for the AI industry.

  Meanwhile, Mr Cheung delivered a keynote speech at the Cybersecurity Forum for Technology Development and International Cooperation today and shared the HKSAR Government's policies and practices in promoting threat intelligence sharing and emergency response collaboration, as well as constructing a collaborative defence system. He stated that, in the face of increasingly complex cybersecurity threats, the HKSAR Government continues to promote intelligence sharing with other regions, deepen collaborative defence with local, Mainland and international partners, and further enhances cybersecurity governance to provide robust protection to the digital development of the HKSAR. Hong Kong will also fully leverage its role as a bridge in connecting the motherland internally and the world externally to promote international cybersecurity co-operation, making an active contribution to building a secure, trustworthy, shared and prosperous community of shared future in cyberspace.

  Mr Cheung also joined and spoke at the Data Governance Forum this afternoon, when he pointed out that the HKSAR Government has promulgated the Principles of Data Governance as well as the Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline respectively to enhance quality and reliability of data, strengthen the protection of data, and provide the industry with an AI governance framework with local characteristics that is suitable for the Hong Kong context, and to effectively manage risks while encouraging innovation. Additionally, since the launch of the facilitation measure on the Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information Within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong), the facilitation measure has been widely acclaimed by the industry for enhancing overall convenience and effectively facilitating the integration of services in the financial, medical and talent aspects within the GBA.

  Ms Cheong visited the 2025 Light of Internet Expo and the World Internet Science and Technology Museum in Wuzhen before attending the forum to learn about the latest developments in technology in Hangzhou.

  During their visit to Hangzhou, Ms Cheong and Mr Cheung, accompanied by the Director of Zhejiang Liaison Unit of the HKSAR Government, Mr Terence Lau, visited the Hangzhou Biopharma Town and the Hangzhou Transfar Science and Technology City on November 6 to learn about the R&D layout, product pipeline and industrialisation planning in biopharmaceutics, medical devices, biomedical engineering and medical big data of the two parks. They also engaged in discussions with enterprises operating in the parks. They then visited the headquarters of the Transfar Group and met with the management team of the Group to learn about its international layout as well as planning and management of its technology park. Ms Cheong introduced the development of Hetao Hong Kong Park to the Group and invited it to settle there where the Group can expand businesses in Hong Kong by combining the Group's R&D advantages in biotechnology research and building science and technology city with the opportunities in Hong Kong's rapid I&T development.

  On November 7, Ms Cheong and Mr Cheung attended the opening ceremony and plenary session of the Summit. In the afternoon, they, accompanied by Mr Lau, visited Hangzhou Yunshenchu Technology Co Ltd and Hangzhou Yushu Technology Co Ltd of Hangzhou's ""Six Little Dragons"", to learn about the R&D and application of AI and robotics as well as the global development plans of the two enterprises. The duo shared with the management of the enterprises that under the National 15th Five Year Plan, Hong Kong will enhance its distinctive advantage of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, coupled with the proactive development of AI and robotics industries in Hong Kong, which can help the two enterprises connect their R&D outcome and applications with the global markets.

  Mr Cheung attended the 2025 edition of the ""Straight to Wuzhen"" Global Internet Competition - the ""Wings of Digital"" Innovation Night yesterday evening in support of the annual ""Straight to Wuzhen"" Global Internet Competition organised by the WIC and the People's Government of Zhejiang Province. He took the opportunity to cheer for the two Hong Kong teams that won in the Asia-Pacific regional competition, wishing them great success in the finale.

  Ms Cheong concluded her visit today and returned to Hong Kong in the evening.

  Mr Cheung will attend the Awards Presentation Ceremony and present awards at the ""Straight to Wuzhen"" Global Internet Competition, which is co-organised by the Digital Policy Office, tomorrow (November 9). He will return to Hong Kong in the evening.

  In addition to the renowned annual Wuzhen Summit, the WIC will continue to designate Hong Kong to host the WIC Asia-Pacific Summit in April next year."

Hospital Authority enhanced mortuary charge arrangement free storage period extended to 28 days,2025-11-08 15:40,2025-11-08 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800540.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (November 8) the enhanced public hospital mortuary charge arrangement, following a review and prudent consideration of feedback from the public and stakeholders, so as to encourage efficient use of mortuary resources while addressing the needs of the majority of citizens.

With an ageing population, the number of deaths in public hospitals has been steadily rising from approximately 32 000 in 2007 to over 41 000 in 2024, representing a 28 per cent increase. The HA has been adding resources for hospital mortuary storage space. The number of spaces has been significantly increased from 1 500 in 2007 to approximately 3 360 currently, marking a 124per cent increase. The ratio of mortuary storage spaces to hospital beds has increased from 1:18 in 2007 to 1:9 in 2024.

To facilitate funeral arrangements for the public, the HA has been processing death certificate applications as quickly as possible. Over 95per cent of death certificates can be issued within three working days, and more than 99per cent within seven working days. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department also pledges to provide cremation sessions within 15 days.

However, the average duration of storage of bodies in HA mortuaries continues to increase, with approximately 10per cent of bodies being stored for more than a month, and some even exceeding one year. Due to the prolonged storage, the occupancy rate of HA mortuaries frequently exceeds 100 per cent. Taking 2024 as an example, eight out of 38 hospital mortuaries experienced occupancy rates exceeding 100per cent between February and May. During the service demand surge in 2025, 13 mortuaries recorded above 100per cent occupancy rates. Given the limited resources in public hospitals, the HA needs to effectively balance the allocation of resources between mortuaries, which serve as temporary body storage facilities, and patient care services.

""The introduction of mortuary charge does not aim at increasing the HA's revenue. It adheres to the principle of 'co-payment by those who can afford' and reducing wastage, encouraging families to collect the deceased bodies to arrange funerals as soon as possible, thereby alleviating pressure and overcrowding situation in public hospital mortuaries. After listening to extensive feedback from the public and stakeholders recently, the HA has agreed to enhance the mortuary charge arrangements by extending the free storage period. This will allow families more adequate time to process death documentation, to prepare the funeral arrangement, and book cremation sessions, while also reducing their financial burden,"" the HA spokesperson said.

After prudent consideration, the HA has decided to extend the free storage period from three days, as stated in the initial arrangement, to 28 days. The details are as follows:

Duration of body storage
Mortuary charge


First 3 days
No charge


From day 4
$100 per day


From day 18
$200 per day


From day 34
$550 per day








Enhanced arrangement


Duration of body storage
Mortuary charge


First 28 days
No charge


From day 29
$200 per day


From day 36
$550 per day




According to the past data, the median storage duration for bodies in HA mortuaries is approximately three weeks, with over 80per cent of cases having storage periods of 28 days or less. Under the enhanced arrangement, the majority of deceased patient cases will not incur any charges. Among the remaining cases, it is estimated that another 10per cent can have fee waivers through various mechanisms. Overall, it is projected that less than 10per cent of all cases will ultimately need to pay for the charge.

""We believe that extending the free storage period to 28 days will provide most families with ample and reasonable time to manage the funeral arrangement for their deceased relatives, enabling a more focused approach on handling cases with extended mortuary stays. This adjustment aims to alleviate public concerns, ensuring that the new charge arrangement achieves the goal of effective utilisation of public resources while reflecting care and compassion for bereaved families,"" the HA spokesperson said.

The spokesperson reiterated that the comprehensive fee waiver mechanisms for families with financial difficulties or special circumstances will remain unchanged. These mechanisms include fee waivers for eligible recipients of financial assistance, fee reductions based on medical fee waiver ratios, and exemptions for delays caused by factors beyond families' control, such as the coroner's inquests. If families experience financial difficulties in affording the mortuary charge for their deceased relatives, they can seek assistance from the hospital to help them apply for fee waivers based on their actual situations.

The HA expresses gratitude for the constructive feedback from all sectors of society regarding the mortuary charge, which has been crucial in refining the arrangement. We hope that the new arrangement will strike an appropriate balance between encouraging efficient use of public resources and showing compassion for the public.

The HA has considered various factors while determining the mortuary charge, including operational costs and charge levels for similar services in the market. The HA has been working to enhance mortuary services in recent years, including the setup of farewell rooms or similar facilities in certain hospitals, allowing families to arrange for the direct transfer of bodies from the hospital to cremation or burial services."
醫管局優化殮房收費　遺體存放免費日數增加至28日,2025-11-08 15:40,2025-11-08 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800382.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

​醫院管理局（醫管局）早前公布公立醫院殮房收費檢討，在細心聆聽及積極回應市民和持份者的意見後，今日（十一月八日）公布優化有關收費安排，務求在鼓勵善用殮房資源的同時，能夠照顧大部分市民的需要。

隨着人口老化，在公立醫院逝世人數一直上升，從二○○七年約32 000人增至二○二四年的超過41 000人，升幅達28%。醫管局亦一直增加資源提供醫院殮房儲存遺體的空間，由二○○七年約1 500個大幅增加至現時約3 360個，升幅達124%，殮房儲存空間與病床比例由二○○七年1:18提升至二○二四年1:9。

為便利市民安排殯葬，醫管局一直盡快處理死亡證明書的申請。超過95%死亡證明書可於三個工作天內發出，七個工作天內發出比率超過99%。而食物環境衞生署亦承諾15天內提供火化服務時段。

儘管如此，遺體平均存放於醫管局殮房時間持續增加，約一成遺體在殮房停放超過一個月，部分更逾一年。由於遺體擺放時間長，醫管局殮房使用量不時超過100%。以二○二四年為例，38間醫院殮房在二至五月期間有八間出現超過100%使用量。在二○二五年服務高峰期間，更有13間殮房使用率超過100%。在公立醫院資源有限的情況下，醫管局需要有效地平衡作為短期存放遺體輔助設施的殮房，以及照顧病人的資源分配。

醫管局發言人說︰「醫管局提出殮房收費並非以增加收入為目的，而是秉承能者共付、減少浪費的原則，鼓勵家屬盡早領取離世病人的遺體安排殯葬，減輕公立醫院殮房的壓力及擠迫情況。醫管局近日聆聽了不少市民及持份者的意見，同意優化殮房收費安排，增加遺體存放免收費日數，讓家屬有更充分時間處理辦理死亡文件、籌備殯儀服務及預訂火化時段等事宜，亦可減輕家屬的經濟負擔。」

醫管局經審慎權衡後，決定放寬遺體存放免費日數，由原本方案的首三日增加至首28日。詳情如下：




原本方案


遺體存放日數
殮房收費


首3日
不收費


第4日起
每日100元


第18日起
每日200元


第34日起
每日550元








經優化後新方案


遺體存放日數
殮房收費


首28日
不收費


第29日起
每日200元


第36日起
每日550元




根據過往數據，遺體在醫管局殮房的存放時間中位數為約三星期，存放28日或以下更佔超過八成。因此在優化的收費安排下，大部份離世病人的個案均無須繳費。在餘下的個案中，估計再有約一成可透過各項機制獲費用豁免。綜合計算，預計最終需要繳付殮房服務費用的個案將少於整體的一成。

發言人表示：「我們相信，將遺體存放免費日數大幅增加至28日，能為絕大部分家屬提供充裕及合理的時間，以處理先人的身後事，亦能夠更聚焦處理較長期停留殮房的個案。這項調整旨在釋除公眾的疑慮，確保新收費安排在達到善用公共資源的目標之同時，亦能體現對喪親家屬的關懷與體恤。」

發言人重申，為有經濟困難或特殊情況家庭而設的全面豁免機制將維持不變。機制包括為合資格的經濟援助受助人提供費用豁免、按醫療費用減免比例作出恩恤，以及豁免因死因裁判等非家屬能控制因素所引致的延誤收費。如家屬為先人繳交殮房服務收費時有經濟困難，可以向醫院尋求協助，醫院可按實際情況協助家屬申請豁免有關費用。

醫管局感謝社會各界就殮房收費提出的建設性意見，有關反饋對完善政策至關重要。我們期望新方案能在鼓勵善用公共資源與體恤市民之間取得恰當平衡。

醫管局在釐定殮房收費時，已考慮各項因素，包括醫院運作及市場同類服務收費水平等。近年醫管局一直致力優化殮房服務，包括在部分醫院設置惜別室或同類設施提供院出服務，方便家屬可以安排將先人遺體直接從醫院送往火化或安葬。"
Hospital Authority enhanced mortuary charge arrangement Free storage period extended to 28 days,2025-11-08 15:40,2025-11-08 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800540.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (November 8) the enhanced public hospital mortuary charge arrangement, following a review and prudent consideration of feedback from the public and stakeholders, so as to encourage efficient use of mortuary resources while addressing the needs of the majority of citizens.

With an ageing population, the number of deaths in public hospitals has been steadily rising from approximately 32 000 in 2007 to over 41 000 in 2024, representing a 28 per cent increase. The HA has been adding resources for hospital mortuary storage space. The number of spaces has been significantly increased from 1 500 in 2007 to approximately 3 360 currently, marking a 124per cent increase. The ratio of mortuary storage spaces to hospital beds has increased from 1:18 in 2007 to 1:9 in 2024.

To facilitate funeral arrangements for the public, the HA has been processing death certificate applications as quickly as possible. Over 95per cent of death certificates can be issued within three working days, and more than 99per cent within seven working days. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department also pledges to provide cremation sessions within 15 days.

However, the average duration of storage of bodies in HA mortuaries continues to increase, with approximately 10per cent of bodies being stored for more than a month, and some even exceeding one year. Due to the prolonged storage, the occupancy rate of HA mortuaries frequently exceeds 100 per cent. Taking 2024 as an example, eight out of 38 hospital mortuaries experienced occupancy rates exceeding 100per cent between February and May. During the service demand surge in 2025, 13 mortuaries recorded above 100per cent occupancy rates. Given the limited resources in public hospitals, the HA needs to effectively balance the allocation of resources between mortuaries, which serve as temporary body storage facilities, and patient care services.

""The introduction of mortuary charge does not aim at increasing the HA's revenue. It adheres to the principle of 'co-payment by those who can afford' and reducing wastage, encouraging families to collect the deceased bodies to arrange funerals as soon as possible, thereby alleviating pressure and overcrowding situation in public hospital mortuaries. After listening to extensive feedback from the public and stakeholders recently, the HA has agreed to enhance the mortuary charge arrangements by extending the free storage period. This will allow families more adequate time to process death documentation, to prepare the funeral arrangement, and book cremation sessions, while also reducing their financial burden,"" the HA spokesperson said.

After prudent consideration, the HA has decided to extend the free storage period from three days, as stated in the initial arrangement, to 28 days. The details are as follows:

醫務衞生局局長會見傳媒談癌症治療及公營醫院殮房收費（只有中文）,2025-11-08 14:55,2025-11-08 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800397.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授和醫院管理局（醫管局）行政總裁李夏茵醫生今日（十一月八日）上午出席亞洲——大洋洲粒子治療合作組第五屆年會後會見傳媒的談話內容：

醫務衞生局局長：各位，很開心今日來到這個國際性的粒子放射治療的學術大會。粒子治療包括質子治療，是在癌症治療方面最先進的一種技術。香港作為國際醫療創新樞紐，我們亦正積極推動這些先進的治療療法，特別是在創新方面──創新的藥物和醫療器械的治療，我們希望在這方面加大力度，亦配合行政長官在今年的《施政報告》中很重視的癌症治療。粒子治療，包括質子治療，是特別對兒童癌症有非常大的好處，它的副作用比較少，而治療效果是相對好。我們的兒童醫院亦通過撒瑪利亞基金，把公立醫院病人轉介到現有香港第一個質子治療中心做治療，這對兒童癌症病人有很大的幫助。

另外，我亦想就最近市民很關心的一個題目，就是公立醫院──醫院管理局的醫院的殮房服務收費的問題，我想與醫院管理局行政總裁李夏茵醫生一起在此向大家作個預告，在今日下午一時，醫院管理局會在其總部，因應最近考慮了市民和持份者的意見後，對殮房的收費作進一步優化，提出一個修改的方案，其中包括把最初提出的，在殮房儲存免費的日期由三日延長至28日。

其實公立醫院的收費改革，當中亦包含了殮房服務的收費改革。在公立醫院的收費改革中，我們強調其中一個原則是「能者自付、用者共付」這個原則，我們希望通過這個收費引導市民善用現有的醫療資源，從而令我們的醫療系統可以更持續化，亦可應對未來面對的人口老化，以至供不應求的問題，從而令我們的醫療安全網更穩固。

公立醫院作為一個全港最重要的醫療服務機構，他們提供殮房服務作為一個非醫療的輔助性質服務，目標主要是對於逝世病人作一個短期的保存。隨着人口老化，確實在公立醫院逝世的人數是不斷增加的，由二○○七年約32 000人，到現在增加了24%（應為28%），至超過41 000人。而同一時間，其實醫院管理局亦非常努力增加醫院殮房儲存空間的設施，由二○○七年的1 500個，增加到3 360個，增幅的百分比其實遠遠超過逝世的人數，增加了128%（應為124%）。同一時間，在死亡證的簽發方面，我們保持超過95%的人可以在三日之內完成，而食環署（食物環境衞生署）亦有一個承諾，在安排火化方面可以安排在15日內給予服務。不過，我們看到醫院管理局在殮房遺體存放的平均日數方面是不斷上升，平均數已經去到三個星期，個別超過一個月、甚至一年。那麼長的時間，遺體用冷藏方法儲存，其實單靠冷藏方法，對先人的防腐作用並不是做得那麼好，甚至可能會影響遺容。另一方面，那麼長的儲存時間亦真的會影響醫院管理局的殮房使用。在個別的殮房，使用率甚至在很多時間會超過100%，這情況真的很不理想，這亦是為何我們有需要引入殮房收費作改革。

在此我再強調，我們引入收費並不是為了增加收入，其實主要目的，是想引導市民──死者的家屬，他們可以考慮盡早安排處理殯儀服務，從而將遺體運送到殯儀機構，這樣可以為先人着想，令先人早日安息。同一時間亦可以減低醫管局醫院殮房的壓力和擠迫的情況，甚至是超出100%的使用率。

在此我想請醫管局行政總裁李夏茵醫生向大家補充關於醫管局醫院內的殮房現在的服務情況，以至我們下午記者會向大家提出修改收費的方案。

醫管局行政總裁：謝謝各位，首先我向大家解釋一下，醫管局當日為何有此理念，希望醫管局的殮房會有一個收費。其實我們思考的過程，並不是因為今次的收費改革而開始的，其實很早之前我們已經在研討這個議題。

我們基於信念就是：死者已矣，先人早點入土為安，其實也是對他的一份尊重。而且葬禮無論大小或是甚麼形式，其實都是一個很好的機會，讓在世的人跟先人道別。而這個機會，其實也正正是讓在世的人，去面對自己的傷痛，和走出自己傷痛的一個機會。再加上，我們有收費改革，有關理念也是好像剛才局長所說的用者自付。而我們也參考了醫管局使用殮房的情況，以及市場一般的價格安排。我們便有以下的提議。

我們原本的提議是，首三日，當遺體送抵醫管局殮房時，是會不收費。這個理念是，我們翻查我們的數據，大部分、差不多95%的遺體，醫生均可以在三日內發出死亡證，亦可以讓在世的家人做以後關於殮葬的情況。但我們近來聽到很多不同的社會聲音和關注，尤其是當我們提及收費的步伐和幅度。我們亦很希望從善如流，所以最新的收費，我們將免收費的期限由三日延至二十八日，即是首四個星期我們不會收費。當遺體留在醫管局殮房第五個星期的時候，我們便會開始收每一天200元的收費，到第六個星期的時候，便會是550元一天。其實原意和目的是希望在世的人可以早些認領遺體，然後舉辦葬禮。我們翻查我們的數據，大概28日，80%存放在醫管局的遺體已經離開醫管局殮房，而餘下20%的遺體則留在醫管局裏。而我們根據過去的數據，這些遺體大部分均屬於經濟援助和可以申領豁免的病人的遺體。所以我估計在新政策下，有大約10%的病人的遺體可能需要付費。

這個安排，我們能夠達到的效果是，在世的人可以早點面對先人離開，而且對先人尊重，可以舉辦一個葬禮，令到自己可以早點走出傷痛。稍後在醫管局大樓，下午一時左右，我們的同事就會再詳細跟大家解說仔細的情況，我今天的報告就到這裏。

記者：首先想問現在才由三日延長至28日，為何一開始免費期只有三日？公布的時候各方是否知情？想問現在有部分遺體是存放超過一年，當局會否推出懲罰性收費？有沒有一些家屬去跟進？如果大部分都沒有，會否再收取更多費用？另外，亦想問推出是次收費改革，出現這個問題後會否認為推得過急或闖關失敗？

醫務衞生局局長：我先指出殮房服務是醫管局一個非醫療服務。我們總體檢討醫管局收費時，其中一樣我們要檢討的行政費用就包括這些非醫療服務。醫院管理局是有向醫務衞生局提交方案，所以醫務衞生局是知道的。

至於醫院管理局為何會提出三日免費期，我相信剛才李醫生亦已經作出解說，就是考慮到大部分醫生既然已經可以發出死亡證，或許可以在這個時候開始收費，能者共付。因為在原本的方案中，第四日開始也只是收取100元，所以我們認為這是合理。而且我們有推出豁免機制，領取綜援或長者生活津貼等的病人約60萬，或者可以申請醫療費用減免的人士，即使是這項非醫療費用，都可以獲得減免。換言之，在明年一月一日開始，已經差不多有200萬人可以申請醫療費用減免，而減免亦會包括殮房費用，這就是當時的考慮。至於其他考慮，李醫生有補充。

醫管局行政總裁：謝謝局長，或者我再補充多一點，當我們思考三日不收費的時候，其實我們也預備了其他豁免的方法，剛才除了局長提及經濟環境不理想的家人可以申請外，其實我們亦預備了如果有很少部分的病者，醫生未能在三日之內發出死亡證，又或者遺體需要進行死因裁判的程序，我們亦預備會豁免收費。當日我們的解說是，我們預備了會豁免收費的。至於剛才記者朋友問到，部分遺體逗留在殮房多於一年，我們如何處理呢？其實現時我們也不停與家人聯絡，提醒他們，希望他們盡早領取遺體，餘下我們都會繼續做。也會將收費的情況、一月一日之後實施的情況，我們都會跟他們解說，這都是我們會繼續做的工作。

記者：當時決定三日免費存放期時，雖然有豁免方案，但坊間有提到等待火化的過程很長，現時這些豁免方案是否會繼續？即免費期延長至28日時，是否都會繼續有這些豁免方案呢？等待火化期較長的人怎麼辦呢？可能28日都未必足夠讓他們等到排期火化遺體，這些人又可以如何處理？因為坊間指出可能一個月免費期是最好，28日其實都未足一個月，只是四個星期。另外想知道局方先前有否諮詢市民？因為有人認為欠缺透明度，認為這個方案是突然推出。

醫務衞生局局長：四個星期和一個月並不是相差很大。另一方面你提到的火化安排，我剛才已經一再強調，食環署已經有一個承諾，是會安排遺體在15日內火化。加上預計死亡證發出的所需時間，原本我們計算大部分情況都已經可以在三個星期內完成，甚至是足夠的。現時延長至四個星期已經有一定的時間作緩衝期，令絕大部分先人家屬如果不是較有要求的話，其實一定可以獲得一個食環署提供的火化時段，但是亦考慮到有個別先人家屬要特別選擇某個時間和地點等各方面，這些有很多其他的因素包含在內。這類個别情況則要家屬自行作出考慮。但總體來說，我們認為四個星期是一個合理而充分的時間予絕大部分市民在殮葬安排方面照顧其先人。

醫管局行政總裁：至於有關諮詢方面，都要提一提。其實在整個收費改革裏面，我們也有跟病人接觸、有諮詢。當然，你提及他們也會有一些不同的意見。不過大家都同意，其實我們要尊重先人，入土為安是一個重要的因素。還有，大家都不想有些遺體要共用一個屍格，都不想有這些情況出現。所以在這方面，要疏導我們殮房的流程，我們希望可以增加流轉，這個都是一個共識；至於收費的程度，當然各人有各種不同的意見，我們希望這次最新的方案可以從善如流，也可以令到他們的關注沒那麼緊張，也沒有那麼大的壓力。

醫務衞生局局長：我補充一下關於把遺體放在醫院殮房28日的問題，其實這不只是考慮到能否配合火化安排或者醫院殮房的擠迫情況。從殮葬角度來看，醫院殮房是單純以冷凍的方法發揮防腐作用。遺體在冷凍的情況下，三個星期未能完全發揮防腐作用，開始會出現一些腐化的情況，如果冷凍至四個星期已經是極限，這會影響遺體容貌，所以希望市民首先要明白，醫院作為一個醫療機構，短暫存放逝世病人遺體確實是必需提供的服務，但是醫院並非一個長期存放遺體的地方，不只是涉及資源問題，甚至是影響到遺體的保管，而殯儀機構有更高的技術，不只是冷凍遺體。如果一些遺體需要長時間保存，它們可能會提供更好的服務。把遺體完全放置在醫院殮房冷凍四個星期，已經開始不太理想，我希望市民亦為其先人着想，讓他們早點入土為安，不要在遺體保存方面出現一些不理想的情況。

記者：想問局長這個收費方案由明年元旦開始，但為何在這個時候才公布？會否覺得時間有些倉促？為何不在當初提出醫療收費改革的記者會上一併提及？另外，今次的公布略為隱蔽，市民可能亦要透過報道才得知有這項收費，一些豁免機制也是事後才理解到，會否認為今次做法好像缺乏透明？另外，當日你們構思殮房收費時，有否想像過今日市民的反應會有點反彈？剛才有提到部分先人遺體已經在醫院放置超過四個星期，有否研究原因是甚麼？剛才局長亦提到殯儀業界的情況，我們亦聽到殯儀業界指出他們的配套其實都未必足夠應付全港公立醫院遺體的服務，當局推出這個收費前有否與業界商討，或者了解整個情況才推出收費？剛才局長也指出考慮到三個星期都足夠讓市民處理，為何當初推出的時候免費（存放期）是三日而非三個星期？

醫務衞生局局長：關於三日的考慮，李醫生已經作出解說，我相信不需要再重覆。至於你提到的醫療收費改革，是在三月時提出的。我想強調我們在提出這個改革時，第一步的重點就是把醫療服務放在首位。因為醫院管理局作為全香港超過九成市民的醫療健康安全網，首要肯定就是照顧好患病的病人，所以我們在公布的時候，重點是着重醫療服務各項收費。隨着我們的解說獲得市民對收費改革的認可，我們特别強調有三項的收費資助的保障逐步落實，是增加了對「貧、急、重、危」病人的支援。醫管局一直忙於處理行政工作，以至落實明年一月一日的醫療收費改革安排，特别是包括病人如何申請豁免。當然，同時我們也要檢討非醫療服務的收費，包括很多行政上的工作，例如醫療報告、影印等各類項目，其中一個就是殮房服務。我們強調這是一個非醫療服務，雖然這也是一個相當重要的服務。醫管局同一時間考慮到「用者自付、能者共付」原則而提出這個方案。至於在諮詢和溝通方面，我讓李醫生跟大家談談。

醫管局行政總裁：其實有關諮詢剛才都說過了，回答前面記者問題的時候也是，我們在整個收費改革的時候，也跟病人有一個很緊密的聯繫和諮詢。其實到了這個階段，這個溝通仍在。尤其是一月一日開始收費的時候、所有的流程等等，我們均與病人組織以及病人都走得很近，希望他們可以理解這個情況。所以你說在這個過程裏面，我們着實是有諮詢的，但當然，諮詢越長越多越闊越好，不過我們也有時間性的限制，所以我們都會汲取教訓，看看如果他日有些事情的時候，可能我們會將諮詢變得更廣闊，希望大家可以給一些意見，不會有這樣的情況。"

Afterwards, Mr Tang and the heads of the disciplined services and auxiliary services performed the pledging ceremony by piecing together puzzles, each showing a department badge, onto a lighting installation with the election slogan ""Join the Election Together We Create the Future"", symbolising the concerted efforts of the SB, the disciplined services and the auxiliary services to fully support the Legislative Council General Election.

After the ceremony, Mr Tang and the heads of the departments led their teams to distribute election leaflets in various districts to appeal people to cast their votes on the December 7 polling day."
香港海關檢獲約二百五十萬元懷疑可卡因（附圖）,2025-11-08 13:10,2025-11-08 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800368.htm,"​香港海關於十月三十一日在香港國際機場偵破一宗空運販運毒品的案件，檢獲約四公斤懷疑可卡因，估計市值約二百五十萬元，並拘捕一名男子。

海關當日透過風險評估及情報分析，在機場檢查一件從阿拉伯聯合酋長國抵港並報稱螺栓和螺帽的空運貨物。經檢查後，海關人員發現貨物內藏有約四公斤懷疑可卡因。

跟進調查後，海關人員十一月六日採取監控遞送行動，在旺角拘捕一名涉案收貨男子，年齡二十歲。該名被捕人士已被控以一項販運危險藥物罪，將於十一月十日在西九龍裁判法院提堂。

海關會繼續根據情報分析，加強打擊販運毒品活動，同時呼籲市民提高警覺，切勿貪圖金錢利益而參與販毒活動，不要接受任何人士聘請或委託運送受管制物品進出香港，亦切勿於未確定物品屬性的情況下，貿然協助他人運送。此外，市民亦要避免將個人資料或地址交予他人以作收取包裹或貨物用途。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

海關提醒年青人，切勿心存僥倖，鋌而走險。販運危險藥物屬嚴重刑事罪行，一經定罪，將對他們的前途造成嚴重影響。

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cocaine worth about $2.5 million (with photo),2025-11-08 13:10,2025-11-08 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800369.htm,"âHong Kong Customs detected a trafficking case involving air cargo at Hong Kong International Airport on October 31 and seized about 4 kilograms of suspected cocaine with an estimated market value of about $2.5 million. A man was arrested.

Through risk assessment and intelligence analysis, Customs on October 31 inspected an air consignment, declared as bolts and nuts and arriving in Hong Kong from the United of Arab Emirates, in the airport. Upon examination, Customs officers discovered that the consignment had about 4kg of suspected cocaine concealed inside.

After follow-up investigations, Customs officers mounted a controlled delivery operation in Mong Kok on November 6 and arrested a male consignee, aged 20. The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug and he will appear at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on November 10.

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people, nor to release their personal data or home address to others for receiving parcels or goods.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Customs reminds young people to pay attention to the fact that drug trafficking is a serious criminal offence. Criminal conviction will result in grave repercussions for their future and they should not take risks in the hope that they may not be caught.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."

記者：局長，想問一下JPEX案，剛才提到科技發展過程中都會出現一些模糊性，其實有甚麼例子？又或是投資者應該要怎樣警惕？另外，總結過去一星期的金融科技周，覺得效果很好，可否都談談那個情況？

財經事務及庫務局局長：其實今年是金融科技周十周年。你看到過去十年，我們的發展有很大進步，例如十年前香港的初創公司數量可能只有1 600家，現在接近5 000家。具體一點說到金融科技公司，我們比對去年，現在的增長也有一成，達到1 200間，這些是量的變化，看到我們金融科技生態圈越來越豐富。

質方面的變化，你看到無論是政府方面的主動性，例如我們針對電子資產、數字資產有兩個宣言，我們針對AI也有一個宣言。同一時間，巿場的回應和反饋都很積極和迅速，包括現在對AI的應用、對區塊鏈的應用、對代幣化產品的應用，我覺得對比過往而言是越來越廣泛，越來越深入，越來越具體。下一步我覺得趨勢都是類似的，就是隨着金融科技的發展越來越深入，是會更多企業也好，或是金融機構也好，就會想把這個科技用在一些現有產品上。過去有些產品可能大家沒有想過會變成投資產品的，例如是一些潛在的長期收入，如充電樁，怎樣將這些長期收入轉化成代幣化投資產品，令投資者可以參與。也有一些情況正在試驗的就是長期的租船收入，這些長期的收入怎樣通過區塊鏈，變成一個長期的、可以認證的收入給投資者去投資。我覺得這些都是一些很具體的項目，是因為金融科技的落實而體現到的。

回到你剛才的問題，我覺得無論是日常投資者的教育工夫，包括一些產品推出的時候，巿場上一定會有不同理解和認知的落差，所以一定要持續做好投資者的教育工作，這些工作我們會繼續。

Remarks by SFST about fintech at media session,2025-11-08 10:53,2025-11-08 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/08/P2025110800262.htm,"Following are the remarks made by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at a media session after attending a radio programme this morning (November 8):

Reporter: Hi, English questions from RTHK. So how is the Government adapting its regulatory framework in response to the evolving cryptocurrency landscape? My second question is, you mentioned that there were significant changes in the fintech ecosystem over the past few years. What specific trends are you seeing that could shape the future of financial technology? Thank you.

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: In fact, we have been adopting a very consistent approach in terms of how we regulate the digital assets sector, which is based on the principle of similar business, similar risk, and similar regulation. Throughout the various legislations that we have enacted, including the regulation of the digital asset exchanges, the Stablecoins, and also the coming regulation of custodians and digital asset trading, the same principle will apply.

In response to your second question about the changes that we observed, I think, first of all, what we see is that there have been changes in terms of how our institutions here in Hong Kong are approaching fintech. For example, if you look at the adoption of AI among our financial institutions, three years ago, the number was around a quarter of the serving institutions. But now the number almost goes to around three quarters. And apart from the wider adoption of technology, another angle to look at is in terms of the extent to which it has been adopted. Right now, you see more focused and also at the same time more embedded implementation of some of the fintech initiatives.

Like blockchain, there have been a lot of discussions, a lot of adoptions in terms of how some tokenised products can be more widely used, for example tokenised deposits and also tokenised money market funds. In such a way that there could be more opportunities given to companies to maximise their returns on their reserves and also on their capital. So all in all, I would say what you observed is an increase in the proportion of companies adopting fintech, at the same time is the extent to which they apply fintech in various elements of their work."

Ambassador Ambrosetti (Ambassador of Italy to China, Mr Massimo Ambrosetti),Consul General Ficarra (Consul General of Italy to Hong Kong and Macao, Mr Carmelo Ficarra), Ambassador Harvey Rouse (Head of the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao), Mr Davide De Rosa (President of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Buona sera. Good evening. It is truly a pleasure to join you once again at the Annual Gala Dinner of the Italian Chamber of Commerce. This is a splendid and memorable evening - a celebration of enduring friendship, warm company and great fun, as well as a valuable opportunity for networking and forging deeper co-operation.

This evening reminds me of the many qualities that connect Hong Kong and Italy - not just by fine cuisines, great wines and designer handbags, but also by our shared passion for creativity, craftsmanship and elegance. Whether it is the style and sophistication of Italian design, or the dynamism of Hong Kong's business and cultural scenes, we are both driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence.

Last year at this very dinner, I spoke about Hong Kong's role as the gateway to the Chinese Mainland and the broader Asian region. Tonight, I would like to expand on that, particularly in light of the global geoeconomic landscape and China's development strategy.

Despite shifting tides of geopolitics, Hong Kong continues to be open, welcoming, and firmly committed to free trade and investment. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, we proudly serve as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", linking businesses, capital, people, ideas and opportunities across borders. 

This strategy has proven to be both right and rewarding. We are seeing renewed confidence and optimism in Hong Kong by global investors and businesses. The remarkable surge in our stock market, and growing international recognition of Hong Kong's strengths and competitiveness, are clear and encouraging indicators of this positive development.

We continue to be ranked as the world's freest economy, and we stand among the top three global financial centres. We came third globally in international competitiveness according to the IMD (International Institute for Management Development). Earlier this year, all three major international credit rating agencies reaffirmed Hong Kong's strong credit ratings. 

These encouraging recognitions motivate us to go further and to chart new frontiers.

Last year, I also shared about Hong Kong's commitment to innovation and technology. We stay on course, striving to build an even more vibrant technology sector to drive our next phase of growth. That will diversify our economic structure and provide more quality career opportunities for our people. Our focus is on AI and data science, biotech, fintech, new energy and new materials - areas that we hold clear competitive advantages.

And the carrier of our vision is the Northern Metropolis. We are accelerating its development through two major approaches. 

First, policy innovation. We are dismantling barriers and embracing bold, flexible development models - such as large-scale land disposals - to fast-track integrated development of land, infrastructure and industries. More flexible, tailor-made incentive packages will be offered to attract top-notch global enterprises.

Second, further deepening cross-boundary collaboration with other cities in the Greater Bay Area. The Shenzhen-Hong Kong co-operation zone is a focal point, with innovative policies. For example, seamless flow of capital, goods, talent, data and even biosamples in this zone, plus a streamlined regulatory process to shorten the time to market of drugs and medical devices developed there. This zone will be very attractive to firms in AI, biotech and pharmaceutical products.

Italian companies and start-ups are most welcome to be part of this exciting journey. Set up your R&D (research and development) centres here. Collaborate with our universities and research institutions. Establish advanced manufacturing facilities. Explore our thriving innovation and technology ecosystem.

Above all, we invite Italian businesses to make use of Hong Kong as your platform to expand into the Chinese Mainland and the broader Asian region. And our vibrant financial sector stands ready to help them in raising the funds needed to support their business expansion.

As China advances its high-level two-way opening up, we are elevating our strategic role as a two-way platform - helping Hong Kong and Mainland businesses go global, while helping foreign businesses to seize the opportunities in China and Asia through our city.

I am delighted to share that later this month, I will lead a high-level business delegation to Milan. The delegation will include representives from the Government and related public organisations, business associations, and about 30 to 40 Hong Kong and Mainland enterprises from sectors such as finance, medical and health, green and sustainability, transport and logistics, as well as professional services.

We will be there to explore partnership opportunities with Italian businesses - to invest in Italy, expand further into Europe, and help bring more Italian businesses into the immense opportunities of China and Asia.

Before I close, allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Italian Chamber of Commerce and the Italian Consulate-General for your steadfast support and partnership over the years. Your efforts have played a vital role in strengthening the ties and friendship between our communities, and fostering more collaboration in business and cultural exchanges.

May your businesses flourish, your connections grow stronger, and may our friendship continue to deepen and thrive.

Grazie. Thank you."

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-11-07 21:30,2025-11-07 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/07/P2025110700856.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (November 7) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP reiterated its appeal to urge schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 13-year-old boy with good past health. He has developed a fever since October 24, the situation persisted and he further developed cough, sore throat and runny nose since October 29. He attended a private hospital on November 1 and was admitted for treatment. He was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit of Queen Mary Hospitalyesterday (November 6). He is currently in stable condition. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with pneumonia and pleural effusion.

One of his household contacts developed influenza-like illness symptoms recently, and subsequently recovered. Four of his schoolmates in the same form recently developed respiratory symptoms, one of them required hospitalisation and was subsequently discharged after recovery, whose nasopharyngeal swab specimens also tested positive for influenza A virus. The symptoms of the other three patients are mild and hospitalisation was not required. The CHP has advised the school to implement the necessary infection control measures and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance.

Including the abovementioned case, there have been 17 severe paediatric influenza cases since the start of the school year in September, including one fatal case. The affected children aged 11 months to 17 years, with 12 having good past health and 11 had not received SIV for the season.

""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season, with influenza activity steadily rising since early September. It peaked in mid-October and has remained at high levels since then. According to the latest surveillance data, influenza activity began to decline in the last week of October. The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses decreased from approximately 12 per cent in mid-October to 8.73 per cent while the influenza admission rate in public hospitals fell from 0.89 cases per 10 000 population to 0.53 cases. Based on current trends, influenza activity is expected to remain at relatively high levels in the coming weeks. However, as the weather turns cooler, fluctuations cannot be ruled out. We need to observe for another one to two weeks to confirm whether influenza activity has peaked. Based on past experience, Hong Kong's winter influenza season typically occurs between January and March. Therefore, a resurgence early next year cannot be ruled out. I urge all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received the SIV, to act promptly, particularly those high-risk groups such as the elderly, children, and adults with underlying illnesses and immunosuppression. Members of the public may also contact their family doctors to arrange for vaccinations,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

""Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an AED immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions,"" Dr Tsui said.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
