"GCMTI specialist awarded title of ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"" - sharing Hong Kong's expertise to serve nation (with photo)",2026-02-11 16:20,2026-02-11 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100553.htm,"​The Department of Health (DH) today (February 11) announced that Dr Queenie Wong, a Plant Taxonomist at the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) of the DH, has been awarded the prestigious title of ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"" by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) following a rigorous selection process. She is the first DH officer to receive this national honour.

The NATCM selects around 100 Chinese medicine practitioners, scholars and researchers across the country every three years. Candidates must be under 45 years old, demonstrate high professional standards, and show capabilities in preserving tradition and driving innovation in Chinese medicine. It nurtures and supports these scholars in conducting pioneering research in Chinese medicine. This year, two scholars from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were honoured with the title: Dr Wong and Professor Lisa Xian, Assistant Professor of the School of Chinese Medicine, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam, extended his heartfelt congratulations to both recipients.

Dr Wong has served in the DH for nine years. Dr Lam said, ""Dr Wong has devoted herself to the micro-morphological identification of Chinese medicines (CM), combining the strengths of traditional macroscopic techniques with modern microscopic identification methods. Her work has enabled the GCMTI to establish an innovative, practical, and accurate identification system that helps the industry authenticate genuine CM and promotes their safe use. Her selection as a 'Qi Huang Young Scholar' from numerous applicants nationwide not only affirms her outstanding research achievements but also underscores the HKSAR's potential to become an international centre for CM testing and quality control. The GCMTI, which commenced services in phases late last year, is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities that will undoubtedly provide greater support for Dr Wong's research endeavours in the future. Leveraging Hong Kong's strengths, she will contribute to serving the country's needs and, together with the GCMTI's scientific team, advance the development of Chinese medicine for the health and well-being of all.""

Expressing her gratitude, Dr Wong said she is deeply honoured to be nominated by the DH and selected nationally as a ""Qi Huang Young Scholar"". She acknowledges the huge responsibilities that come with the title and looks forward to collaborating with fellow scholars to conduct innovative research under the NATCM's guidance, contributing to the inheritance and advancements of Chinese medicine in the country. She also aspires to further elevate the research capacity in Chinese medicine in Hong Kong and promote co-operation between the HKSAR and the Chinese Mainland.

Since its establishment, the GCMTI has aligned closely with the national strategy for developing Chinese medicine, adopting a three-pronged approach of ""technologies, standards and talents"" to drive high-quality development in Chinese medicine. Dr Wong firmly believes that the GCMTI will continue to inject new momentum into the sector, serving as a vital support for Chinese medicine's global advancement and better integrating into the country's overall development.

The GCMTI brings together experts from multiple disciplines and has long been committed to establishing internationally recognised reference standards and testing methods for CM. By promoting technology transfer, it has enhanced the quality control and identification capabilities of the CM industry and testing sector. The GCMTI has gained widespread recognition in the industry and internationally, particularly for establishing Hong Kong's leading position in the field of micro-morphological identification of CM.

Micro-morphological identification involves using instruments or high-power magnifying glasses to observe minute surface features of CM that are difficult or impossible to discern with the naked eye (see Annex). These features serve as identification criteria, supplementing traditional macroscopic identification methods. For CM with similar morphology, micro-morphology provides additional distinguishing features to differentiate visually similar species. To promote the use of this simple, easy and cost-effective micro-morphological identification, the GCMTI has conducted specific research in this area and developed practical identification methods tailored for real-world applications to address challenges commonly encountered by the industry.

With the phased commissioning of its permanent building since late last year, the GCMTI's advanced technology and equipment will further enhance the development of CM's testing methods and standards, supporting the comprehensive, high-quality development of Chinese medicine in Hong Kong."

They also witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on strengthening co-operation and exchange in the provision of comprehensive overseas services.

 With the signing of the MOU, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the MOC will strengthen co-operation and exchange in the provision of comprehensive overseas services by leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, thereby fostering closer collaboration between Mainland enterprises seeking to go global and Hong Kong professional service providers, and strengthening the capacity of Mainland enterprises in going global. The MOU also supports the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) to develop a professional services platform, pooling together Hong Kong professional service providers in the field of finance, legal and dispute resolution, accounting and audit, testing and certification, etc, to support Mainland enterprises seeking to go global.

 Mr Yau thanked the MOC for its continuous support in the investment promotion work of the HKSAR Government. Leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages amid the opening up of the country, the HKSAR Government will support Mainland enterprises to go global, further foster investment and trade relations between Hong Kong and the Mainland, and strive to reinforce and enhance Hong Kong's status as an international trade centre.

 Mr Yau said, ""The country is implementing a high-level strategy of two-way opening up to encourage Mainland enterprises to go global. The MOC is spearheading the implementation of the related work in the provision of comprehensive overseas services. As a 'super connector' and a 'super value-adder', Hong Kong can help Mainland enterprises expand businesses abroad and overcome challenges encountered in the process. The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau has set up the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global (GoGlobal Task Force) to co-ordinate cross-bureau, cross-departmental and cross-organisation work to provide one-stop go global support. The GoGlobal Task Force will make use of various channels to promote to target Mainland enterprises the advantages of using Hong Kong as a springboard to go global. It will also provide tailored services according to the needs of the enterprises to support their overseas expansion through Hong Kong.""

 Mr Yau added, ""The HKTDC is currently developing a cross-sectoral platform, which assembles Hong Kong professional service providers from different fields to match them with different Mainland enterprises based on their needs, thereby supporting the enterprises to establish a foothold in Hong Kong and then expand their businesses overseas. The platform will also bring more business opportunities to the Hong Kong professional service providers and increase the influence of Hong Kong professional services locally and internationally. The GoGlobal Task Force will co-ordinate the organisation of different promotional events on the Mainland and Hong Kong, and will identify and attract enterprises to go global via Hong Kong.""

 In his 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the establishment of a one-stop platform by mobilising Hong Kong's overseas offices, including those under Invest Hong Kong and the HKTDC, as well as Hong Kong offices on the Mainland, and has set up the cross-bureau, cross-departmental and cross-sectoral GoGlobal Task Force to proactively attract Mainland enterprises to go global via Hong Kong. Since its inception last October, the GoGlobal Task Force has worked closely with relevant Mainland authorities and progressively formulated and implemented relevant work.

 Mr Yau concluded his visit this afternoon and willreturn to Hong Kong this evening."
政府中藥檢測中心專家獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號　以香港專長貢獻國家（附圖）,2026-02-11 15:00,2026-02-11 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100483.htm,"衞生署今日（二月十一日）公布，衞生署轄下政府中藥檢測中心（檢測中心）植物分類學家黃麗麗博士，經國家中醫藥管理局（管理局）嚴格選拔，獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號，成為首位獲此殊榮的衞生署人員。

管理局每三年在全國遴選約100位45歲以下、具高中醫藥專業水平和傳承創新能力的中醫師、學者和研究人員，重點培養和支持他們進行有關中醫藥的前沿創新研究。今年香港特別行政區（特區）共有兩人獲國家授予「青年岐黃學者」稱號，另一名獲此殊榮的是香港中文大學中醫學院助理教授冼彥芳。衞生署署長林文健醫生衷心恭賀黃麗麗博士及冼彥芳教授。

黃麗麗博士加入衞生署已九年，林文健醫生說：「黃麗麗博士長期致力於微性狀鑒定中藥，結合傳統性狀鑒定與現代顯微技術的優點，協助檢測中心制定一套創新、簡便而準確的鑒定方法，讓業界更容易鑒定中藥正品，同時有助推動中藥安全使用。她從全國眾多申請人中脫穎而出成為新一屆『青年岐黃學者』一員，除了充分肯定她的卓越研究成就，亦彰顯香港特區具備成為中藥檢測和質量控制國際中心的能力。去年底分階段投入服務的檢測中心配備尖端設施，日後定能為她的研究工作提供更大助力，以香港所長貢獻國家所需。黃博士將與檢測中心的科學團隊共同為推動國家中醫藥發展、為人類健康福祉貢獻智慧和源源力量。」

黃麗麗博士對獲衞生署推薦參與全國選拔，並獲選「青年岐黃學者」深感榮幸，亦深知任重道遠。她希望可以與其他頂尖的「青年岐黃學者」在管理局的指導下，開展更多創新研究，助力國家中醫藥的傳承和突破，同時進一步提升本港中醫藥的科研水平，促進香港特區和中國內地的合作。

檢測中心成立以來，一直緊隨國家中醫藥發展戰略，奉行「技術、標準、人才」三輪驅動，助力中醫藥高品質發展。黃麗麗博士深信她服務的檢測中心定能為中醫藥高品質發展不斷注入新動力，成為中醫藥走向世界的重要支撐點，更好融入和服務國家發展大局。

檢測中心匯聚多個學科的精英，多年來致力為中藥建立國際認可的參考標準與檢測方法，並透過推動技術轉移，提升中藥業界與檢測業界在品質控制與鑒定的能力，深受業界及國際認可，特別在中藥微性狀鑒定領域，為香港建立了領先地位。

微性狀鑒定是應用儀器或高倍放大鏡（見附件），觀察中藥表面肉眼不易察覺或未能看清的細微性狀特徵，並以此作為鑒定依據，是傳統性狀鑒定的延伸。對於性狀特徵較為相近的中藥，微性狀可以提供更多特徵以助區別外形相似的品種。由於微性狀鑒定簡便易行而又經濟實用，因此檢測中心特別開展有關方面的研究，針對業界日常所遇到的困難，建立切合實際應用的鑒定方法。

隨着檢測中心永久大樓自去年底分階段投入服務，其高端科技和器材將進一步提升中藥檢測方法及中藥標準開發能力，助力香港中醫藥全方位高質量發展。"

The fourth scene, ""Vision of Harmony"", features star-like fireworks drifting across the sky like peaceful horses galloping toward the horizon, symbolising love and hope for the world. This scene concludes with the Chinese character ""吉"" (meaning ""good fortune""), sending blessings to Hong Kong. The grand finale, ""Triumphant Achievement"", will feature majestic crown-shaped fireworks followed by a rapid-fire sequence of high-density bursts, delivering best wishes for the prosperity of the nation and good fortune for all.

 In addition to the dazzling fireworks, lighting effects will be featured to enhance the overall viewing experience.

  The display can be seen from many vantage points on both sides of the harbour, including Tsim Sha Tsui, Mid-Levels, Central, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Hung Hom.

 To enhance their fireworks experience, members of the public are invited to tune into Radio Television Hong Kong Radio 4 (FM 97.6 to 98.9) for synchronised music.

 Members of the public are urged to help keep public areas clean and to show respect for public property. They are also urged to show consideration to others to make the event a safe one."

Secretary for Health visits Shenzhen (with photos),2026-02-11 14:58,2026-02-11 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100422.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, visited Shenzhen today (February 11) to meet with health officials from the Guangdong Provincial and Shenzhen Municipal Governments, as well as port control officials. The visit aims to further deepen cross-boundary healthcare collaboration with the Mainland, particularly with Mainland cities within the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

  Professor Lo first met with Deputy Director of the Public Hygiene and Health Commission of Shenzhen Municipality (SZHC) Mr Li Chuang and Second-level Inspector of the Office of Port of Entry and Exit of the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government (Shenzhen Port Office) Mr Wu Bing as well as representatives from the Shenzhen Customs and the Shenzhen General Station of Immigration Inspection. A representative from the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office of the Department of Health (DH) introduced the tobacco control direction and policies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government at the meeting.

  Professor Lo expressed gratitude to the Shenzhen Municipal Government for their long-time support in fostering cross-boundary healthcare measures. He said, ""I would like to give special thanks to the SZHC, the Shenzhen Port Office, the Shenzhen Customs and the Shenzhen General Station of Immigration Inspection for their support on the HKSAR Government's work on tobacco control, including enhancing the promotion of Hong Kong's latest tobacco control regulations to visitors travelling to Hong Kong in the boundary control point area in Shenzhen, and working together in advocating the concept of the 'Smoke-free Port, Fresh Bay Area'. I look forward to deepening co-operation and exchanges between Shenzhen and Hong Kong, thereby reducing the harm caused by tobacco together and safeguarding public health.""

  Professor Lo then visited the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZH) with Deputy Director-General of the Health Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHC) Mr Deng Linfeng to inspect the practical implementation of cross-boundary healthcare measures and visit the hospital's phase II development.

  Professor Lo said, ""Since July 2024, the Health Bureau has piloted the 'Cross-boundary Health Record' and the 'Personal Folder' functions on the eHealth mobile application at HKU-SZH, which support Hong Kong citizens to securely use their electronic health records outside Hong Kong under the principle of 'bring your own health records'. The two functions have been extended to 19 medical institutions under the 'Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme' since September 2024. Starting January this year, we have made a significant breakthrough through the 'Personal Folder' function. Citizens can authorise three medical institutions in the GBA to directly deposit radiology reports and images, which are often challenging to upload themselves, into their personal eHealth accounts. This upgrade allows citizens to store and utilise electronic health records from healthcare services received outside Hong Kong in a more convenient and secure manner, thereby facilitating greater continuity of care. We look forward to continuing our partnership with the GDHC to further advance cross-boundary health record sharing, with a view to supporting the cross-boundary medical needs of citizens more effectively and improving the quality and safety of cross-boundary healthcare services.""

  During the inspection at HKU-SZH, Professor Lo also interacted with Hong Kong seniors receiving treatment. He was pleased to learn that they found the usage arrangements for the Elderly Health Care Voucher convenient, with the medical process and services being meticulous and smooth. They commended the HKSAR Government for expanding the voucher's applicability to 21 service points within the Mainland cities of the GBA, providing them with more healthcare options and saving them the trouble of long journeys, thereby enhancing their sense of well-being.

  Members of the delegation include the Permanent Secretary for Health, Mr Thomas Chan, and representatives from the DH and the Hospital Authority."

牌照處發言人表示：「牌照處根據情報，在整個行動突擊巡查了十二個處所，當中有六個處所均涉嫌無牌經營酒店或賓館，另外有三個持牌賓館則被發現涉嫌違反發牌條件。如在完成調查後有足夠證據，牌照處會作出檢控。」

發言人強調：「無牌經營酒店或賓館屬刑事罪行，根據《旅館業條例》，一經定罪會留有案底，最高刑罰為監禁三年及罰款500,000元，就罪行持續期間的每一日亦可被另處罰款20,000元。針對涉及重犯罪行的無牌經營酒店／賓館，法庭亦可就有關處所發出為期六個月的封閉令。另外，凡持牌酒店／賓館違反任何發牌條件（例如：未經批准進行改動及加建工程），一經定罪最高可處罰款100,000元及監禁兩年，並可就罪行持續期間的每一日另處罰款10,000元。」

為加強阻嚇力以打擊無牌酒店及賓館，《旅館業條例》於二○二○年作出修訂，賦權旅館業監督就同一處所於16個月內第二次因無牌經營酒店或賓館或嚴格法律責任罪行而有人被定罪，向法院申請向該處所發出封閉令，為期六個月。截至一月三十一日，牌照處根據《旅館業條例》向法院申請發出五宗封閉令，而其中三宗封閉令已獲法院批准。

Office of Licensing Authority of Home Affairs Department steps up enforcement actions against unlicensed and licensed hotels/guesthouses before Chinese New Year holidays (with photo),2026-02-11 14:45,2026-02-11 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100416.htm,"Before the Chinese New Year holidays, the Office of the Licensing Authority (OLA) of the Home Affairs Department conducted an operation codenamed ""Solar Flare"" against suspected unlicensed hotels or guesthouses at Yau Tsim Mong District in early February to ensure the safety of the customers as well as the general public. The OLA also conducted the operation with the Immigration Department and the Labour Department to jointly inspect licensed hotels or guesthouses.

A spokesman for the OLA said, ""Based on intelligence gathered, the OLA carried out surprise inspections on 12 premises throughout the whole operation. Six premises were suspected of operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses, while three licensed guesthouses were suspected of breaching certain licensing conditions. The OLA will initiate prosecution on cases with sufficient evidence after completion of the investigation.""

The spokesman stressed, ""Operating unlicensed hotels or guesthouses is a criminal offence leading to a criminal record upon conviction. According to the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance, an offender is liable to three years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of $500,000. A fine of $20,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues. Moreover, a licensed hotel or guesthouse which contravenes any licensing conditions (e.g. carrying out alteration and addition works without seeking prior approval) is liable to two years' imprisonment and a maximum fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. A fine of $10,000 for each day can also be imposed during which the offence continues.""

To enhance deterrence against unlicensed hotels and guesthouses, the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance was amended in 2020 to empower the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Authority to apply to the court, upon the second conviction within 16 months of operating an unlicensed hotel or guesthouse or the new strict liability offence in respect of the same premises, to issue a closure order to close the premises for six months. As at January 31, the OLA has applied for five closure orders under the Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation Ordinance from the court, of which three closure orders have been issued by the court. 

Apart from conducting special operations during festive seasons, the OLA also steps up efforts to combat unlicensed guesthouses via online platforms. The OLA has strengthened its intelligence collection by forming a dedicated team to browse webpages, mobile applications, social media, discussion forums, etc, to search for information and intelligence on suspected unlicensed guesthouses. The OLA's law enforcement officers will initiate follow-up investigations when information on unlicensed guesthousesadvertised via online platforms is found. The OLA also conducts publicity work on Internet search engines outside Hong Kong toenable tourists' access to the information provided by the OLA in the course of planning their trips to Hong Kong.

Tourists and members of the public can make use of the search functions on the OLA's website (www.hadla.gov.hk) to check whether the hotel or guesthouse concerned is licensed or not. Any suspected unlicensed hotel or guesthouse should be reported to the OLA by the hotline (Tel: 2881 7498), by email (hadlaenq@had.gov.hk), by fax (2504 5805), or through the mobile application ""Hong Kong Licensed Hotels and Guesthouses""."

Among them were the Consul-General of the People's Republic of China in Sydney, Mr Wang Yu; the Minister for Better Regulation and Fair Trading, the Minister for Industry and Trade, the Minister for Innovation, Science and Technology, the Minister for Building and Minister for Corrections of New South Wales (NSW), Mr Anoulack Chanthivong, representing the Premier of NSW; and Councillor of the City of Sydney Mr Robert Kok, representing the Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney.
  
  The Director of the Sydney ETO, Mr Ricky Chong, said in his welcoming remarks that Hong Kong and Australia have long shared a dynamic and multifaceted partnership, underpinned by close co-operation in trade, investment, education, cultural exchanges and people-to-people ties. He noted that Hong Kong was Australia's 15th-largest trading partner and ninth-largest export market last year, with bilateral trade in goods reaching AU$8 billion, while around 200 Australian companies operate in Hong Kong, many using the city as regional headquarters or regional offices.

  Mr Chong highlighted the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government's ongoing efforts to strengthen international economic engagement through the establishment of the Economic and Trade Express, which brings together the collective strengths of overseas Economic and Trade Offices, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The initiative supports Hong Kong enterprises in exploring overseas opportunities and assists Mainland companies in going global, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

  He also introduced the Northern Metropolis, Hong Kong's most ambitious city-building project, which will become a new engine for innovation, technology, education and advanced industries, creating fresh opportunities for businesses, talent and investors from around the world, including Australia.

  Mr Chong also highlighted the launch of the ""Study in Hong Kong"" brand, positioning Hong Kong as an international post-secondary education hub. With five universities ranked among the world's top 100 and a strong emphasis on research and innovation, Hong Kong offers a truly international learning environment for global talent.

  ""As we welcome the Year of the Horse, we look forward to deepening our partnership with NSW and the rest of Australia, expanding collaboration, strengthening economic ties, and fostering even closer connections between our peoples,"" Mr Chong said.

盧寵茂教授首先與深圳市衞生健康委員會（衞健委）副主任李創、深圳市人民政府口岸辦公室（深圳口岸辦）二級巡視員吳兵，以及深圳海關和深圳出入境邊防檢查總站（深圳邊檢總站）代表進行會談，衞生署控煙酒辦公室代表亦在會上簡介香港特別行政區（特區）政府的控煙方向及政策。

盧寵茂教授感謝深圳市政府就促進各項跨境醫療措施一直以來的支持。他說﹕「我特別感謝深圳市衞健委、深圳口岸辦、深圳海關和深圳邊檢總站對特區政府控煙工作的支持，包括加強在深圳的口岸範圍向來港旅客宣傳香港的最新控煙規定，攜手推廣『無煙口岸，清新灣區』的概念。我期望深港兩地繼續深化合作與交流，共同降低煙害，守護公眾健康。」

盧寵茂教授其後與廣東省衞健委副主任鄧林峰到香港大學深圳醫院（港大深圳醫院）調研跨境醫療措施的實際使用情況，並參觀港大深圳醫院二期建設。

盧寵茂教授表示︰「醫衞局自二○二四年七月起以港大深圳醫院作試點推行醫健通流動應用程式的『跨境健康紀錄』及『個人資料夾』功能，在自攜病歷的原則下，便利香港市民安全地跨境使用電子健康紀錄。兩項功能自二○二四年九月起擴展至『長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃』下的19間醫療機構。由今年一月起，我們實現進一步突破，讓市民可透過『個人資料夾』功能授權三間大灣區醫院直接存入一些較難自行上傳的放射檢查報告及影像至個人醫健通戶口，從而更便捷和安全地保存和運用境外就醫時的電子健康紀錄，以獲得更連貫的護理服務。我們期望與廣東省衞健委繼續合力推展跨境醫療紀錄互通，務求更有效地支援市民的跨境醫療需求，提升跨境醫護服務的質量安全。」

在港大深圳醫院視察期間，盧寵茂教授亦與到診的香港長者交流，欣悉他們認為長者醫療券（醫療券）的使用安排便利，就醫流程和服務細緻及暢順，並讚揚特區政府擴展醫療券的適用範圍至大灣區內地城市21個服務點，讓他們有更多就醫選擇並可省卻舟車勞動，為他們帶來幸福感。

代表團成員包括醫衞局常任秘書長陳松青、衞生署代表和醫院管理局代表。"
Speech by FS at Consensus Hong Kong 2026 (English only) (with photos/video),2026-02-11 13:44,2026-02-11 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100394.htm," Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Consensus Hong Kong 2026 today (February 11):

Michael (Chairman of Consensus, Mr Michael Lau), Tom (Chief Executive Officer of Bullish Group, Mr Tom Farley), Jay (President of CoinDesk, Mr Jay Yarow), industry leaders and innovators, friends from around the world,

  It is a pleasure to join you all at the Consensus Conference in Hong Kong for the second consecutive year. Let me begin by thanking CoinDesk for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this iconic event. This conference has become a powerful platform in Asia for exploring the cutting-edge trends in the Web3 space and for fostering partnerships and collaboration. 

Evolving global trends

 Globally, the application of Web3 technologies in finance continues to broaden in both scope and sophistication. A few trends are more prominent. The first is tokenisation of RWAs (real-world assets). In a growing number of markets, tokenisation initiatives are moving from ""proof of concept"" to real-word deployment, supported by more institutional adoption. Government bonds, money market funds and other more traditional financial instruments are increasingly being issued or mirrored on-chain, using digital ledgers to enhance settlement efficiency, enable fractional ownership and unlock liquidity in assets that have traditionally been less liquid.

 Hong Kong is one of the pioneers in this space. The HKSAR Government was the first in the world to issue tokenised government green bonds. Last year, we build on this foundation by issuing the world's largest digital green bond, with a multi-currency offering of HK$10 billion. Meanwhile, financial institutions are becoming more receptive to digital assets. By the end of last year, banks in Hong Kong held over HK$14 billion in digital assets under custody, a year-on-year increase of about 180 per cent. Banks have also begun offering tokenised deposit services, with the total value of such deposits reaching HK$29 billion by the end of last year.

 The second trend is a related and evolving one: that is, the interaction between ""TradFi"" (traditional finance) and ""DeFi"" (decentralised finance). Traditional institutions are now importing DeFi mechanisms into their own architectures – such as automated market-making, programmable liquidity pools and the use of on-chain collateral – to support more efficient trading, funding and settlement.At the same time, DeFi is coming under growing regulatory and supervisory pressure in multiple jurisdictions, particularly in relation to anti-money laundering, investor protection, and broader financial stability. There have been growing calls for DeFi to be brought under existing or emerging digital-asset regulatory frameworks.

 The third trend is the growing intersection between AI and digital assets. AI systems are being designed to interact with tokenised money and smart contracts, enabling the autonomous execution of certain transactions and settlements. At the same time, AI tools are making digital asset markets more intelligent, efficient and data-driven. As AI agents become capable of making and executing decisions independently, we may begin to see the early forms of what some call the ""machine economy"": where AI agents can hold and transfer digital assets, pay for services, and transact with one another on chain. While this shift could deliver substantial efficiency gains, it also raises important questions around AI governance, accountability, and cybersecurity. 

Hong Kong's approach

 Against this backdrop of rapid global experimentation, what are we doing in Hong Kong? We are charting our course, leveraging our unique strengths as an international financial centre to stay at the forefront of innovation and keep pace with emerging developments. A few principles are guiding our strategy. 

 First, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong is free to explore financial innovation, including in digital assets. We stand out as a market with consistent, predictable, forward-looking policies, and a balanced and trusted regulatory framework.We welcome Web3 innovators and institutions from around the world to develop and scale their businesses here. 

 At the same time, we recognisethat innovation often moves faster than regulation, potentially creating gaps and new risks. We are therefore carefully balancing the promotion of innovation with the need for sound risk management. Our objective is to embrace new technologies while safeguarding investors, consumers and the overall financial stability. The principle of ""same activity, same risk, same regulation"" continues to underpin the design of our regulatory framework.

 Second, we see Web3, blockchain technology and AI as powerful enablers of the real economy, rather than ends in themselves.Our policy focus is therefore on how these technologies can be applied to enhance efficiency, lower costs and support concrete, real-world use cases. Ultimately, our aim is to make financial services more inclusive and accessible, while addressing long-standing pain points in transactions and market operations. 

 Third, we are committed to pro-innovation regulation. Our regulators operate with a dual mandate: they not only exercise prudent supervision, but also actively facilitate market and product development.Through mechanisms such as regulatory sandboxes, we support experimentation and, in some cases, co-create solutions in close collaboration with innovators and industry participants.

Some latest initiatives

 Ladies and gentlemen, with these guiding principles in mind, we are pressing ahead to advance Web3 development in Hong Kong. Let me highlight some of our latest initiatives. 

 First, on regulation. We continue to enhance Hong Kong's regulatory framework for digital assets, including the launch of a regulatory regime for stablecoin issuers in August last year. We see stablecoins as a practical tool for addressing the pain points in the real economy, particularly in payments and settlements. In giving out licences, we ensure that licensees have real-world use cases, a credible and sustainable business model, as well as strong regulatory compliance capabilities. Our strategy is moving forward fast, step by step. Therefore, we plan to issue only a small number of stablecoin issuer licences in the first batch in March this year. 

 Meanwhile, we are also finalising the details of a new licensing regime for digital asset dealers and custodian service providers, with the aim of introducing the relevant legislation this summer. Together with the frameworks already in place, this will ensure that our overall regulatory regime comprehensively covers the key nodes of the digital asset ecosystem.

 Second, on product innovation and development. We will regularise the issuance of tokenised green bonds. At the same time, we encourage market innovation and nurture the broader ecosystem. For example, building on the Project Ensemble sandbox, Ensemble TX was launched by the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) in November last year. It is a new pilot phase that enables faster, more transparent and more efficient settlement of real-value tokenised transactions.

 Looking ahead, as the convergence of AI and blockchain continues to accelerate, the Government and our regulators will work with the industry to foster concrete, high-impact use cases, while ensuring that emerging risks are properly identified, monitored and managed.

Concluding Remarks

 Ladies and gentlemen, before I close, let me leave you with this message: the Hong Kong SAR Government and our financial regulators fully recognise the need of and are committed to keeping pace with rapid technological change, and building a vibrant digital asset ecosystem here in Hong Kong. We welcome global innovators like you to join us on this journey.

 In less than a week, we will celebrate the Chinese New Year. The Year of the Horse symbolises agility, stamina and strength. May I wish you all a prosperous and energetic year ahead. And for those who have travelled from afar, I hope you will take some time to enjoy the festive spirit and unique charm of Hong Kong.

 My thanks once again to CoinDesk for hosting this remarkable event in Hong Kong. May this event inspire many more fresh ideas and lasting partnerships. Thank you very much."

香港海關打擊商戶供應重量不足賀年食品,2026-02-11 12:45,2026-02-11 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100249.htm,"香港海關由一月二十九日起於全港各區進行巡查，打擊商戶在農曆新年前夕供應重量不足的賀年食品情況。經試購和抽查後，海關人員發現五間涉嫌違規的商戶，違反《度量衡條例》（《條例》）。

行動期間，海關人員發現當中五間商戶所出售的賀年食品包括瓜子、開心果及糖蓮子等實際重量較宣稱的輕6%至19%不等。

巡查仍在進行中。

海關提醒消費者應光顧信譽良好的商戶，而當購買以重量供應的貨品時，應留意商戶秤量時的過程和貨品的實際重量。

海關同時提醒商戶亦應遵守《條例》的規定。根據《條例》，任何人在按重量或度量供應貨物時，必須按淨重量或淨度量供應；假若貨物的實際重量或度量少於所宣稱的供應量，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一萬元。此外，任何人使用或管有任何偽誤或不完備的度量衡器具以作商業用途，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二萬五千元。而任何人未有讓顧客清楚看見稱量工具所顯示的重量，最高可被判罰款五千元。

海關會繼續嚴厲打擊商戶供應貨物重量不足的違法行為，以保障消費者權益，維護公平的營商環境。

Hong Kong Customs combats traders supplying shortweight Chinese New Year products,2026-02-11 12:45,2026-02-11 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100250.htm,"Starting from January 29, Hong Kong Customs conducted a territory-wide inspection to combat traders supplying shortweight products before the Chinese New Year. After test buys and spot checks, five traders suspected of violating the regulations were found, in contravention of the Weights and Measures Ordinance (WMO).

During the operation, Customs officers found that five traders supplied shortweight Chinese New Year products, including red melon seeds, pistachios and candied lotus seeds, with discrepancies ranging from 6 per cent to 19 per cent.

The inspections are ongoing.

Customs reminds consumers to purchase products from reputable shops and pay attention to the weighing process and the actual weight when the products are supplied by weight.

Customs also reminds traders to comply with the requirements of the WMO. Under the WMO, any person who in the course of trade supplies goods to another person by weight or measure should supply the goods in net weight or net measure. Any shortage of the quantity purporting to be supplied is an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $10,000. In addition, any person who uses for trade, or has in his possession for use for trade, any weighing or measuring equipment which is false or defective commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $25,000. Also, any person who fails to let customers have a clear view of readings of the weighing or measuring equipment is liable to a maximum penalty of a fine of $5,000.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action against shortweight activities to protect consumers' interests and uphold a fair trading environment.
​
Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the WMO to the Customs 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

運輸及物流局局長會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2026-02-11 11:28,2026-02-11 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100302.htm,"​以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（二月十一日）上午會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：二○一八年大埔車禍獨立檢討委員會的專家指他沒有要求巴士乘客強制佩戴安全帶，但局長早前表示這是委員會的建議，你有甚麼回應？是不是誤解了他們的說法？

運輸及物流局局長：我們早前已作交代，會就安全帶法例重新檢視和諮詢公眾。

記者：今早港鐵服務受阻，屬於嚴重事故，懷疑有訊號設備被撞跌在路軌。港鐵是否需要檢討？事發至今港鐵仍未交代事件經過，亦沒有確實指出是關於甚麼物件，只有傳媒消息流通，是否需要港鐵盡快交代？

運輸及物流局局長：政府非常關注港鐵港島綫今早出現事故，影響正常服務，其間我們立即要求港鐵動員派出免費接駁巴士，有超過30輛巴士為市民提供服務。其間運輸署亦要求巴士營辦商加強專營巴士服務，照顧市民需要。

我們已要求港鐵公司就今早的事故於一個月內提交調查報告。另外，我亦要求機電工程署人員到場，現正與港鐵公司就今早發生的事故作詳細了解。同時，我亦已要求港鐵公司在今日內盡快向各位傳媒和市民交代他們初步的調查情況，政府會密切跟進。"

所有在《財政預算案》發表日（二月二十五日）或之前合資格續領的車輛牌照（即六月二十四日或之前牌照期滿而仍有登記的車輛），可在六月二十四日或之前的任何時間按現行收費（註）續期四個月或12個月；
	
所有在《財政預算案》發表日（二月二十五日）或之前合資格續領的香港正式駕駛執照及駕駛教師執照（即六月二十四日或之前期滿，而在續領時期滿不足三年的執照），可在六月二十四日或之前的任何時間按現行收費續領執照；及
	
上述特別安排只適用於符合上述條件的車輛牌照、香港正式駕駛執照和駕駛教師執照的續期申請，不適用於其他牌照服務。


運輸署發言人表示︰「合資格牌照／執照持有人無須揣測《財政預算案》可能提高牌照／執照費用，而急於向各牌照事務處遞交車輛牌照或駕駛執照續領申請。特別安排與《財政預算案》的內容沒有任何關係，署方亦不知悉《財政預算案》的內容。」

註：以電動私家車而言，續領車輛牌照的現行收費是指自二○二五年十一月一日起生效的牌費架構和水平。由於政府為合資格車主提供四個月寬限期的牌費安排，如車輛牌照於二○二六年二月二十八日或之前屆滿，車主仍可在牌照到期日或之前按照二○二五年十一月一日前的舊牌費水平續領牌照。"
TD to implement special arrangements for licence renewals before and after Budget Day,2026-02-11 11:00,2026-02-11 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021000604.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) said today (February 11) that to prevent members of the public from rushing to the Licensing Offices to submit renewal applications for expiring or expired vehicle and driving licences before Budget Day, the TD will implement the following arrangements:


All vehicle licences eligible for renewal on or before Budget Day (February 25), i.e. vehicles that are registered at the time of renewal and have licence expiry dates falling on or before June 24, may be renewed at the present rate (note) for four months or 12 months at any time up to and including June 24;
	
All Hong Kong full driving licences and driving instructor's licences eligible for renewal on or before Budget Day (February 25), i.e. those expiring on or before June 24 and those that have expired for less than three years at the time of renewal, may be renewed at the present rate at any time up to and including June 24; and
	
The above special arrangements only apply to renewal applications for vehicle licences, Hong Kong full driving licences and driving instructor's licences that meet the conditions above, but not other licensing services.


""Eligible licence holders do not need to rush to the Licensing Offices to submit renewal applications for their vehicle or driving licences on speculation that their fees may increase in the Budget. The special arrangements are not related to the content of the Budget, about which the TD has no information,"" a spokesman for the TD said.

Note: For electric private cars, the present rate refers to the licence fee structure and levels effective from November 1, 2025. Since the Government provides a four-month grace period fee arrangement for eligible vehicle owners, if their vehicle licences expire on or before February 28, 2026, they may be renewed on or before the licence expiry date at the old fee level in effect before November 1, 2025."
​運輸及物流局局長在立法會交通事務委員會就《運輸策略藍圖》開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-11 10:55,2026-02-11 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021100210.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（二月十一日）在立法會交通事務委員會就《運輸策略藍圖》的開場發言：

主席、各位議員：

今日向大家匯報關於《運輸策略藍圖》的措施和未來的規劃布局。因為材料非常豐富，我會先簡短發言，希望主席容許我稍後請運輸署助理署長用幾張投影片向大家重點介紹。

交通運輸是現代都市的重要基石，關係着經濟發展，大灣區融合，更是市民每日日常出行的需要。我們團隊按最新的土地規劃，考慮最新的科技發展，制訂了《運輸策略藍圖》，定出未來的工作目標、策略和方向，制定短、中、長期的措施，短期為二○二六及二七年、中期為二○二八至三二年、長期為二○三三至四○年及以後，務求為香港的經濟發展謀動力，令市民的生活更便捷。

《藍圖》以「政策創新」與「技術創新」的「雙創新」思維，前瞻未來二十多年的發展願景。我們將繼續以鐵路為骨幹，並會提升公共交通服務及促進運輸發展進一步邁向智能化、靈活化；亦會促進跨境交通，加強人流與物流的互聯互通。

《藍圖》所訂的「三大主題」與「六大策略」架構共提出25項具體措施，稍後同事會作詳細介紹。最重要的，是在勾劃宏觀、前瞻的布局的同時，亦要令市民感受到，我們可以回應市民需要、增加便利，以及日常出行時所關注的事項。《藍圖》提出將於二○二六年推進27個項目，我想特別提出並重點講講今年內我們的10項重點措施：

（一）首先是基建，我們會強化本地和跨境運輸基建，在「八縱八橫」的運輸基建布局下，首要在今年內全線開通六號幹線、全力推展一系列鐵路及主要道路項目。我們亦會開展研究港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）南向延伸方案，加上在策略地點如洪水橋、新田、紅磡等規劃多元化、最新的運輸交匯樞紐，連通港九新界、市區及北部都會區各個經濟和居住區域，帶動經濟發展和促進人員往來及加快貨物暢通流動；

（二）第二亦與「八縱八橫」相關。隨着經濟及社會發展，我們預期過海交通的壓力會持續增加。因此，我們會研究在未有交椅洲人工島發展下擴大過海交通容量不同方案的可行性，包括現有倡議的走線，即港島西至大嶼山東北連接路、擴建現有隧道，或其他走線方案等。政府會以開放態度仔細研究，以人為本，凝聚共識，務求長遠的基建方案能達致理想的運輸、經濟及成本效益；

（三）在啟德、東九龍及洪水橋／厦村新發展區推展「智慧綠色集體運輸系統」。啟德的項目將於今年內批出合約，而東九龍及洪水橋／厦村新發展區的項目（第一階段）亦會於今年內招標；

（四）公共交通方面，本港公交系統「世一」，每日接近九成出行人次使用公交出行。我們會善用科技，為乘客提供更具效率的公交服務。我們會於今年內推出「需求導向智慧公交」的試行路線，目的是在現行服務之上，透過靈活調派車輛，照顧乘客需求。我們會與專營巴士公司一同探討不同應用場景，例如在偏遠地區或是客流較分散的時段提供加強服務；

（五）在個人化點對點服務方面，預計首批持牌網約車平台最快可於今年第四季開始營運，讓的士與網約車並存互補，為市民提供多元、便捷的個人化點對點服務；

（六）對駕駛者來說，我們會致力透過「一地多用」提供泊車位、自動泊車系統等一系列措施增加車位供應。我們正推進在今年內達成我們於去年初定下兩年間新增逾12 000個私家車及商用車位的目標。我們亦將展開新一輪泊車位供求研究，全面檢視尤其是商用車的停泊情況及需求，長遠做到「商用車輛，夜有所泊」；

（七）科技應用方面，我們將緊貼大數據和人工智能發展，推動數字化交通管理，令市民出行更有效率。我們會籌備市區內首個「交通管理平台」試點應用項目，向公眾提供更多、更實時的交通資訊以規劃行程；

（八）成立由運輸署署長主持的自動駕駛車輛應用促進工作組，目標是訂立自動駕駛載客營運路線圖。在工作組之下，我們希望做到跨部門聯同行業持份者審視自動車項目的進度與需求，並就自動車的測試地點、車輛類別，以及為配合自動車邁向商業營運所需要的牌證安排提供督導。最重要的是，我們會在今年內努力爭取陸續推出「航天走廊」載客服務、積極推進在東涌、機場及啟德等項目邁向無人化；

（九）積極布局低空經濟，制訂《發展低空經濟規劃行動綱領》，構建具國際競爭力的低空經濟生態圈，促進現代運輸發展。首批多於20個「監管沙盒」中較為成熟、風險相對較低的項目，例如無人機進行外牆清洗、電纜、鐵路設施檢視等會進入實際運作；及

（十）我們務求做到人車兼顧，因此更會便利行人，令出行體驗更佳、更省時。我們擴展「實時燈號調節」，以人工智能分析路口的即時車流和行人流量，計算最合適的燈號時間，加強路口運作效率；亦會在全港更多地點設立對角行人過路處，減少行人通過十字路口的時間。

以上是今年的重點工作。《藍圖》以宏觀視野為香港未來二十多年的發展提供動力之外，我亦希望每位市民能夠感受到《藍圖》中每一項措施，都是以一個字，就是「人」作為核心思想，期望令大家在不久的將來，可在日常的生活細節中，感受到更完善的交通網絡、更貼心的公交服務和更易行的城市環境所帶來的好處。

整體而言，特區政府會主動積極對接國家「十五五」規劃，《藍圖》的制定正正響應國家策略，對接「十五五」規劃建議，透過宏觀的基建布局，結合科技創新，吸引國家科企來港，共同構建香港未來的運輸體系，以支撐本港的金融、航運、貿易中心的高效運作，連接全球，促進區域協同發展，以及發揮本港「內聯外通」優勢的戰略使命。這兩方面都是同樣重要，亦是相輔相成。

主席，我現在請運輸署助理署長梁世豪透過投影片介紹重點策略。"

"Speech by SFST at Inaugural Family Office Forum ""Stewardship in the Chinese Context: Family, Legacy, Future"" (English Only)",2026-02-11 10:33,2026-02-11 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021000660.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Inaugural Family Office Forum ""Stewardship in the Chinese Context: Family, Legacy, Future"" today (February 11):

Zhou Li (Deputy Editor-in-Chief of China Daily), ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests,

 Good morning. It is a great privilege to address you today at this Inaugural Family Office Forum. As we work together to position Hong Kong as Asia's premier strategic hub for family offices, we recognise the profound interplay in the Chinese context between family wealth, legacy building, and future planning. Here, wealth stewardship extends beyond financial growth to embrace social responsibility, intergenerational harmony, and lasting impact. Hong Kong is committed to fostering an ecosystem that supports sustainable, responsible, and enduring wealth preservation for families worldwide.

 Hong Kong has long been a leading global wealth management centre. As of the end of 2024, total assets under management in our asset and wealth management sector surpassed HK$35 trillion, with more than 54 per cent originating from outside Hong Kong and the Mainland. The private banking and private wealth management business linked to family offices and private trusts reached HK$1,551 billion. Hong Kong ranks as Asia's largest cross-border wealth management centre, and holds the second position in private equity capital under management in Asia after the Mainland. These strengths create a natural, robust platform for family offices to manage, protect, and grow their wealth effectively.

 With a long history of expertise in private wealth management, underpinned by the rule of law, world-class professional services, and unparalleled connectivity, Hong Kong is ideally positioned as a trusted base for global high-net-worth families establishing or expanding family offices. Globally, over 2.3 million individuals have a net worth exceeding US$10 million, with more than 36 per cent in Asia. Recent data shows Hong Kong hosts the highest number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals in Asia - over 17 000 - making us a magnet for talent and capital in this space.

 In March 2023, we issued the Policy Statement on Developing Family Office Businesses in Hong Kong, outlining targeted measures to build a competitive and supportive ecosystem. These include, among others, a tax concessions regime, the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (New CIES), and the establishment of the Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy. As of end-January this year, the New CIES has received over 3 000 applications, with potential investments exceeding HK$90 billion if all approved. More than 1 600 applications have been formally approved, with investments in equities, debt securities, certificates of deposit, eligible collective investment schemes, limited partnership funds, and real estate with certain restrictions in place.

 Invest Hong Kong's dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team provides one-stop support for family offices seeking to establish or expand in our market. By the end of last year, the team had assisted more than 200 family offices to set up or grow their presence in Hong Kong.

 Building on this momentum, market research just revealed yesterday that Hong Kong now hosts over 3 300 single family offices, an increase of over 25 per cent over a two-year period. We achieved our 2022-25 target of facilitating at least 200 family offices to set up or expand in Hong Kong ahead of schedule. Looking forward, as we plan to further develop the sector, we aim to attract at least 220 more family offices to establish or expand operations here from 2026 to 2028, broadening our reach to include more markets, for example Europe, the Middle East and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). Beyond investments, family offices contribute substantially through other economic and social channels. It is estimated that single family offices in Hong Kong collectively contribute about HK$12.6 billion annually to the local economy through operating expenditure alone, and that they directly employ over 10 000 full-time professionals within their operations.

 Over the past two years, proactive promotion and supportive policies have made family offices a vital pillar of Hong Kong's financial ecosystem. The city offers a unique blend of top-tier professional services, an exceptional quality of life, and leadership in emerging areas such as green and sustainable investments, art, culture, and philanthropy. We will continue refining our measures - including further expansion of scope for qualifying investment for the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single-family offices, covering for example precious metals, loans and private credit investments, and digital assets - to maintain this strong growth trajectory.

 Combined with Hong Kong's absence of capital gains tax and estate duty, our tax concession enables families to enhance after-tax returns, preserve wealth across generations, and direct more resources toward philanthropy, legacy-building, and innovative investments. As Asia's leading cross-border wealth hub, Hong Kong provides unmatched tax certainty and access to diverse opportunities.

 We have intensified global outreach through roadshows in the Mainland, Europe, and ASEAN. We are also extensively featured in international media, and conduct direct engagement with ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Our flagship Wealth for Good in Hong Kong Summit has been a major success. The March edition last year, themed ""Hong Kong of the World, for the World"", brought together influential family office principals to explore technology, artificial intelligence, philanthropy, succession planning, and cultural innovation. Preparations are underway for the next Summit in March this year to sustain this momentum, and reinforce Hong Kong's status as the premier global family office hub.

 In closing, we warmly invite family offices from around the world to join us in Hong Kong. By leveraging our unique advantages - connectivity to the Mainland and the world, robust infrastructure, and a commitment to stewardship - we can together honour family legacies while shaping a prosperous, sustainable future.

 Thank you."
Speech by CE at Consensus Hong Kong 2026 (English only) (with video),2026-02-11 10:30,2026-02-11 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021000642.htm,"Following is the video speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at Consensus Hong Kong 2026 today (February 11):

Mr Michael Lau (Chairman of Consensus), Mr Tom Farley (Chief Executive Officer of Bullish Group), Mr Jay Yarow (President of CoinDesk), industry leaders and innovators, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning, and welcome to Hong Kong. It is my pleasure to join you today at Consensus Hong Kong 2026.

This is a key platform that brings together Web3 leaders from around the world to discuss, and shape, the future of the Web3 ecosystem. I would like to begin by thanking CoinDesk for returning to Hong Kong, hosting this iconic conference once again after last year's success. Your choice underscores Hong Kong's distinct advantages. It also helps to show the world our growing prominence, as a global hub for Web3 and crypto innovation.

Hong Kong is the world's freest economy and one of its three major international financial centres. Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage. We have a long tradition of the rule of law, a judiciary that exercises its power independently, and a common law system that is similar to many financial hubs around the globe. Hong Kong has an open and transparent market, and we enjoy the free flow of capital and a low and simple tax regime.

What's more, Hong Kong's financial regulatory system is robust, and our financial market stands out for its deep liquidity, innovative products and world-class investor protection. As the only city in the world that counts as many as five universities in the global top 100, Hong Kong boasts a highly educated workforce, and a welcoming environment for global talent.

These, and many other advantages, have helped to make Hong Kong the world's number three in global competitiveness, and number four in the World Talent Ranking and World Digital Competitiveness Ranking.

With this unparalleled positioning, Hong Kong has consistently served as a platform that brings together international capital, talent and information, continuing to expand our global markets and reach.

The world of Web3 and digital assets carries with it vast potential. They help to realise more efficient financial transactions, at a lower cost and with more inclusive options. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is committed to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in digital asset. That's why over the past few years, Hong Kong has been actively building the regulatory framework to promote the steady, and sustainable, development of our Web3 ecosystem.

Last June, the HKSAR Government issued the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong. It sets out a vision for a trusted and innovative digital asset ecosystem - one that prioritises risk management and investor protection, while delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets.

I'm pleased that a lot of our initiatives in the area are in good progress. One key initiative is our implementation of the Stablecoins Ordinance last August. This new law provides for a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is actively processing licensing applications, and we believe the first batch of stablecoin issuer licences will be issued within next month.

Meanwhile, our Securities and Futures Commission announced last year the ""ASPIRe"" roadmap, its plan for regulating Hong Kong's virtual asset (VA) market. We have since implemented a series of measures to boost liquidity of the VA market, and expand VA product offerings and services. All for the purpose of facilitating the development of this vibrant area of growth.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is in a strong position in promoting Web3 development. Hong Kong will continue to go all out to stay at the forefront of this pivotal shift in finance and technology. We welcome companies and institutions from around the world to join hands with us, and build a brighter digital future together.

On that note, I wish you all a fruitful conference these two days. Do remember to take some time to experience the life and culture of Hong Kong, Asia's world city. With the advent of the Lunar New Year, I wish you a healthy and prosperous Year of the Horse. Thank you.  "
Contractors/employers and employees urged to pay attention to workplace safety before Chinese New Year holidays,2026-02-11 10:00,2026-02-11 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/11/P2026021000569.htm,"  With Chinese New Year around the corner, the Labour Department (LD) urges contractors, employers and employees to be more vigilant and take adequate safety precautions at workplaces before the long holidays.

  A spokesperson for the LD said today (February 11) that employers and employees should pay more attention to work safety before the Chinese New Year holidays to prevent accidents.

  The spokesperson said, ""As Chinese New Year is coming, employees may become less aware of work safety due to the festive atmosphere or may have to rush to complete work before the long holidays. Employers should therefore step up monitoring to ensure workplace safety and eliminate potential hazards through pre-holiday safety inspections, thereby minimising the chance of grave consequences during and after the Chinese New Year holidays. Safety precautions before the holidays include turning off the power for plant and machinery as well as gas welding equipment, proper storage of chemicals and stacking of materials, extinguishing ignition sources and securing temporary structures.

  ""Management should remind supervisors and employees not to compromise work safety for tight work schedules, including failure to take adequate safety precautions, follow safety procedures or use personal protective equipment. Risk assessments should be conducted by competent persons prior to the commencement of different work processes, with safe work method statements formulated and proper monitoring systems in place, especially for works involving high-risk operations, such as working at height, lifting operations, working in confined spaces, tunnelling works and electrical work,"" the spokesperson added.

  Pursuant to the general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, employers shall provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene the relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

  Meanwhile, employees shall co-operate by following safety instructions and using safety equipment.

  For any enquiries on occupational safety and health, please contact the LD's Occupational Safety and Health Branch at 2542 2172."

勞工處發言人今日（二月十一日）表示，農曆年假前勞資雙方都要加倍注意工作安全，以防止意外發生。

他說：「農曆新年快到，僱員有可能會受到假期節日氣氛影響，或因趕於長假期前完成工作，而對工作安全有所鬆懈。為避免農曆年假期間及假期後發生嚴重事故，僱主應加強監察，以確保工作場地安全，並透過假期前的安全巡視把潛在危害消除。放長假前的安全措施包括關掉裝置和機器的電源及氣體焊接設備、妥善貯存化學物品及堆放物料、熄滅火種，以及固定臨時搭建物。」

他續說：「管理人員應加強提醒督導人員及僱員，不要因工程緊迫而忽略工作安全，包括沒有做足安全措施、遵循安全步驟或使用個人防護裝備等。在進行不同工序前應經由合資格人員進行風險評估，制訂安全施工方案及監察系統，尤其當工程涉及高危作業，例如高處工作、吊運工作、密閉空間工作、隧道工程和電力工作。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》的一般責任條款規定，僱主必須為其僱員提供安全的工作環境、作業裝置及工作系統。違反有關規定，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁兩年。

此外，僱員亦須合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

如有任何職業安全及健康的查詢，可致電二五四二 二一七二，與勞工處職業安全及健康部聯絡。"

FEHD continues to actively follow up on food poisoning cases related to consumption of raw oysters and steps up inspections of food premises selling raw oysters (with photos),2026-02-10 23:02,2026-02-10 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000937.htm,"The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (February 10) expressed deep concern over recent food poisoning cases related to the consumption of raw oysters.Officers from the CFS and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the FEHD immediately conducted investigations at the restaurants concerned, reviewing their food handling procedures and tracing the sources of the oysters. Since February this year, investigations revealed that 10 cases involved the consumption of raw oysters supplied by Seojun Mulsan Co., Ltd. of Korea. For the sake of prudence, the CFS instructed the trade to stop the import and sale in Hong Kong of raw oysters supplied by this company on February 5. In addition, the CFS found 11 cases wereinvolved the consumption of raw oysters supplied by the food factory Jeton International Foods and 88 Investment Holdings Limited. The CFS has promptly instructedthe company to suspend the sale and supply of raw oysters, and issued a press release on related follow-up work on February 6, requiring the trade to stop selling oysters supplied by the company concerned. Investigations into other cases, which involve consumption of oysters from various countries, are still ongoing.

In view of the recent surge in food poisoning cases related to the consumption of raw oysters, the FEHD has carried out special operations and stepped up inspections of various licensed or permitted food premises across Hong Kong, thereby safeguarding food safety and protecting public health. The focuses of the inspections included the storage temperature of raw oysters, storage conditions in designated refrigerators, the sources of supply, the personal hygiene of food handlers, the hygienic condition of the premises, verifying source documents and health certificates, and collecting samples for testing. Over the past five days, the FEHD has inspected about 430 food premises selling oysters, providing immediate advice on food storage, handling and environmental hygiene. Inspections will continue to ensure licensees/permittees comply with licensing conditions and statutory hygiene standards.

The spokesman reminded that as oysters feed by filtering a large volume of seawater and absorbing suspended food particles therein, bacteria (e.g. Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus) and viruses (e.g. norovirus and Hepatitis A virus) may accumulate in them if they are grown in or harvested from contaminated water. Consuming oysters without thorough cooking might risk direct intake of these microorganisms. Susceptible groups, such as pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems or liver diseases, should avoid eating them.

​Consumers are advised to purchase or consume oysters only from food premises licensed or permitted by the FEHD. The trade and food handlers should understand the importance of adhering to good personal hygiene and proper food handling, and provide regular training on hygiene practices and norovirus-related risks. Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food. Separate utensils and cutting boards should be used for raw and ready-to-eat foods, with regular cleaning and disinfection. Food handlers who exhibit symptoms of infection should refrain from handling food until they have been symptom-free for at least 48 hours."
FEHD combats unsatisfactory hygiene conditions and serious rodent infestations in fresh provision shops,2026-02-10 22:35,2026-02-10 22:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000794.htm,"A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (February 10) that, the department has been placing great importance to food safety and environmental hygiene. It will not tolerate fresh provision shops (FPSs) that flout regulations, mishandle pig carcasses, and cause serious rodent infestations that threaten public health. The FEHD will step up blitz operations across districts to clamp down on violating FPSs.

The spokesman pointed out that, during recent late-night special operations along Lok Shan Road in To Kwa Wan and Kowloon City Road, the FEHD discovered that a FPS had poor hygiene condition and serious rodent infestation. To protect public health, the FEHD issued an immediate closure order on January 24 under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance, requiring the shop to immediately cease operation, and carry out thorough cleansing and rodent control. The shop will only be allowed to reopen once the FEHD is satisfied with its hygiene condition. The shop requested the lifting of the closure order on February 6, but as its hygiene condition and rodent control measures remained unsatisfactory, the request was rejected by the FEHD, and the closure order remains in effect.

In addition, the FEHD has carried out special operations across all districts early this month, stepping up inspections of more than 250 licensed FPSs, and taking stringent enforcement actions against irregularities that increase the risk of rodent infestation, with a view to safeguarding food safety and public health. During the special operations, the FEHD staff initiated 47 prosecutions and issued 101 verbal warnings/advice against the FPSs concerned.

The spokesman said that the FEHD will continue to inspect FPSs regularly. To further combat the poor hygiene or serious rodent problems of shops, the department will step up late-night blitz operations across districts. If FPSs are found mishandling pig carcasses in ways that lead to rodent infestation, the FEHD will not hesitate to issue immediate closure orders and cancel their licences to protect public health.

Under the relevant regulation, every person engaged in any food business, including FPSs, shall not knowingly suffer or permit in any food premises, the presence of rats, mice or insects; and shall adopt appropriate measures to protect the food from risk of contamination or deterioration. Operators must at all times keep every part of food premises clean, properly maintained, and in good condition. Offenders are liable to prosecution and a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months. All meat delivered to licensed FPSs must be directly delivered into the licensed premises; otherwise, it constitutes a breach of licensing conditions and may result in immediate licence cancellation. Furthermore, if the condition of a premises poses an imminent health risk, the FEHD has the authority to issue closure orders and immediately close the premises."

鑑於近期與進食生蠔相關的食物中毒個案有所上升，食環署在全港各區採取特別行動，加強巡查全港多個持牌食物業處所，以保障食物安全及公眾健康。巡查的重點包括生蠔的保存溫度、存放在指定雪櫃內的情況、生蠔的供應來源、食物處理人員的個人衞生及食物業處所的衞生情況、查核生蠔的來源文件和衞生證明書，以及抽檢生蠔樣本作檢測等。過去五天，食環署已巡視全港約430間出售生蠔的食物業處所，其間就食物的存放、處理和衞生情況作出即時衞生建議。巡查會繼續進行，確保持牌／持證人或相關負責人遵守有關牌照或許可證條件，並符合法例訂明的衞生標準。

發言人提醒，由於蠔隻以過濾大量海水、吸收在海水中懸浮食物粒子的方式進食，如果養蠔或採蠔的水域水質帶有細菌（例如副溶血性弧菌和創傷弧菌）及病毒（例如諾如病毒和甲型肝炎病毒），這些物質會在蠔的體內積聚。進食未經徹底煮熟的蠔可能會有直接攝入這些微生物的風險，孕婦、幼童、長者、免疫力弱人士及肝病患者等容易受感染的人士，應避免進食。

消費者應到持有食環署牌照／受限制食物售賣許可證的食物業處所購買或進食生蠔。業界及食物處理人員應了解遵循良好個人衞生習慣和妥善處理食物的重要性，並定期培訓員工有關良好衞生規範及與諾如病毒相關的風險。處理食物前後應用梘液及清水徹底洗手最少20秒，以及使用獨立的器具和砧板處理生食及即食食物，定時清潔和消毒。出現感染症狀的食物處理人員須於症狀消失最少48小時後才再次處理食物。"

財經事務及庫務局常任秘書長（財經事務）在香港銀行學會第18屆「傑出財富管理師大獎」頒獎典禮暨晚宴致辭（只有中文）,2026-02-10 21:28,2026-02-10 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000801.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局常任秘書長（財經事務）甄美薇今日（二月十日）在香港銀行學會第18屆「傑出財富管理師大獎」頒獎典禮暨晚宴致辭：

Arthur（香港銀行學會理事會主席兼香港金融管理局副總裁阮國恒）、勞總監（澳門金融管理局金融發展廳代總監勞婷沁）、Carrie（香港銀行學會行政總裁梁嘉麗）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。感謝香港銀行學會的邀請，讓我有機會出席這個年度盛事。「傑出財富管理師大獎」今年來到第18屆，歷年為銀行業樹立許多行業榜樣，並不斷因應行業發展加入新的評核元素，推動香港以至大灣區整體財富管理水平不斷提升，為業界與客戶帶來莫大裨益。

我知道各位得獎者都要經過嚴格的篩選才能獲獎，我衷心祝賀所有得獎者。您們的成就不僅是對個人專業能力的肯定，亦是對財富管理行業整體水準的認可。

香港是領先國際金融中心，我們一直通過不同措施，加強香港資產及財富管理業的競爭力。今天，我希望藉這個機會與大家分享香港在推動資產及財富管理行業發展的最新政策和方向。

根據香港證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）的最新統計，截至二○二四年年底，香港的資產及財富管理業務總值按年增加百分之十三至超過35萬億港元。這良好勢頭在二○二五年持續，在香港註冊成立的證監會認可基金去年全年錄得的淨資金流入超過3,500億港元。

為配合資產及財富管理業業界的發展趨勢和需要，創造有利增長的環境，政府會於二○二六年上半年向立法會提交條例草案，優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠稅制，吸引更多有潛力的基金和家族辦公室來港落戶。

具體而言，我們會拓寬免稅制度下「基金」的定義，涵蓋退休基金及捐贈基金，增加基金及單一家族辦公室享有稅務寬減的合資格投資種類，以涵蓋碳排放相關的產品、保險相連證券、貸款、私募債權投資、貴金屬和數字資產等。另外，我們亦會優化分發附帶權益的稅務寬減安排。

我們已提前完成在《行政長官2022年施政報告》所訂立在二○二五年年底前協助不少於200間家族辦公室在香港設立或擴展業務的目標。今日發表的《香港家族辦公室市場研究》顯示，截至二○二五年年底，香港的單一家族辦公室數目已超過3 380間，兩年內增加超過680間，升幅超過百分之二十五。此外，「新資本投資者入境計劃」自推出以來反應熱烈，已接獲超過3 000宗申請，預計可為香港帶來逾900億港元投資。

我們希望透過這些措施，在現今地緣政治充滿不確定性的環境下，便利世界各地的投資者和家族辦公室善用香港穩定和在「一國兩制」下的獨特制度優勢，在港進行及管理資產配置業務。

與此同時，我們正落實其他一系列推動金融業發展的措施，為資產及財富管理行業帶來新的發展機遇。

其中，政府正銳意推動黃金交易的發展，把香港建設成為國際黃金交易中心，吸引黃金現貨在香港儲存、清算和交割，從而帶動全產業鏈的發展。我們亦會推動市場開發更豐富的黃金投資工具，開發新產品，為投資者提供更多元化的投資選擇，增強市場的流動性，提升香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，同時為財富管理行業帶來新的增長點。

另外，跨境理財通是粵港澳大灣區金融市場雙向開放的重要載體，不僅為內地、香港和澳門居民搭建規範而便捷的跨境財富管理渠道，更推動三地財富管理行業實現資源互補、市場聯通，為行業發展開拓更廣闊的市場空間。二○二四年推出的「理財通2.0」優化版，帶動投資者人數及跨境匯劃金額實現顯著增長，分別達17.7萬人和超過1,310億元人民幣。優化措施既豐富了大灣區居民的資產配置選擇，更注入新動能，推動內地資本與金融要素有序流動，鞏固香港的國際資產管理中心地位，亦促進灣區民生金融深度融合。

我很高興知道香港銀行學會一直與時俱進，在設計培訓內容及「傑出財富管理師大獎」的評核準則時，融入最新的政策發展，並透過培訓與案例研討，幫助從業人員深入理解這些新興領域。

香港特區政府於二○二五至二六年度《財政預算案》中提出持續推動綠色和可持續金融發展，並透過延長「綠色和可持續金融培訓先導計劃」，加強本地相關人才培育。學會積極於培訓課程中融入相關元素，協助學員把政策理念轉化為實務應用個案，鼓勵業界將ESG（環境、社會及管治）元素融入營運、投資及財務策劃之中，提升從業人員的專業素質，也為行業的持續發展注入新的活力。

今年是國家「十五五」規劃的開局之年，我們期待與業界一起貢獻國家的經濟發展。我相信，在政府、業界和各位得獎者的共同努力下，我們的金融、銀行和財富管理行業將迎來更輝煌的發展。

最後，再次衷心恭賀各位得獎者，期望您們未來在財務計劃及財富管理專業領域繼續大放異彩。我祝願頒獎典禮及晚宴圓滿成功，各位業界仝人在馬年工作順利、身體健康、業務興旺、馬到功成。多謝大家！"
食環署全力打擊衞生欠佳及鼠患嚴重的新鮮糧食店,2026-02-10 20:45,2026-02-10 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000793.htm,"​食物環境衞生署（食環署）發言人今日（二月十日）表示，署方高度重視食物安全和環境衞生，對於早前有新鮮糧食店漠視法規，不當處理豬隻屠體，導致店內鼠患嚴重，影響市民健康的情況絕不容忍。署方將加強在各區採取突擊行動，取締違規的新鮮糧食店。

發言人指出，食環署近日在土瓜灣落山道和九龍城道一帶採取深宵特別行動，發現一間名為「金寶肉食公司」的新鮮糧食店衞生不佳並且鼠患嚴重。為保障公眾健康，署方已在一月二十四日根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》向店鋪發出即時封閉令，勒令其即時暫停營業，徹底清潔和消毒有關處所，並進行有效滅鼠工作，直到署方滿意其衞生情況，方會考慮批准其重新營業。該店鋪曾於二月六日提出解封要求，但由於店內的衞生狀況及滅鼠措施仍未達標，因此署方已拒絕其解封要求，該封閉令至目前為止仍然生效。

此外，食環署已於本月初在全港各區採取特別行動，加強巡查超過250間持牌新鮮糧食店，嚴厲打擊增加鼠患風險的違規情況，以保障食物安全和公眾健康。在特別行動中，署方人員就違規情況向相關新鮮糧食店共作出101次口頭警告／勸喻，以及提出47宗檢控。

發言人表示，食環署會持續巡查新鮮糧食店。為進一步打擊衞生不佳甚至鼠患嚴重的店鋪，署方未來會加強在各區採取深宵突擊行動，若發現有新鮮糧食店不當處理豬隻屠體導致鼠患，會毫不猶疑向店鋪發出即時封閉令及取消其牌照，以保障市民健康。

根據相關法例，任何從事食物業人士，包括新鮮糧食店，不得明知而容受或准許任何食物業處所內有老鼠或昆蟲存在；而且須採取一切合理地需要的措施保護食物，以免食物受到污染或變壞。經營者亦須時刻保持食物業處所各部分清潔、維修妥善和狀況良好。違例者會被檢控，最高刑罰為罰款一萬元及監禁三個月。所有運送到持牌新鮮糧食店的肉類，均須直接送進該持牌處所內，否則違反牌照條件，會被即時取消牌照。此外，如處所情況構成對健康的即時危害，食環署有權作出封閉令，立即封閉該處所。"
律政司副司長在印尼推廣香港普通法制度及法律和金融等專業服務優勢（附圖）,2026-02-10 20:18,2026-02-10 21:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000779.htm,"律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（二月十日）在印尼雅加達出席國際論壇，並會晤當地政商界人士，推廣香港在「一國兩制」下在法律、金融等專業服務的優勢，強調香港會積極擔當「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，促進中國內地與東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）成員國的聯繫。

早上，張國鈞出席東南亞中國年會2026，就香港的獨特優勢如何助力鞏固和發展與印尼等快速崛起的新興市場的經貿夥伴關係，向在場政商界人士分享看法。

他表示，香港的獨特優勢可以體現於四個層面：首先是「不可替代」，香港是印尼以至東盟成員國企業開拓中國內地市場及中國內地企業進軍東南亞市場不可替代的橋樑；第二，「互聯互通」，香港作為國際金融樞紐，在金融和法律等專業領域高度互聯，並反映國際最佳做法；第三，「創新」，香港的創新政策與時並進，積極支持不同界別的發展。例如，跨國企業遷冊來港後能享受香港的簡單低稅制；第四，「不可或缺」，普通法制度是香港賴以成功的關鍵，香港的法治穩健，中英雙語的普通法制度與國際接軌，法律清晰透明，為跨國投資提供穩健法律保障，是不可或缺的國際法律樞紐。

張國鈞表示，香港期望通過發揮其獨特優勢，與印尼及其他東盟國家攜手合作，推動亞洲地區共建繁榮。

論壇舉行期間，張國鈞與中國駐印尼大使館臨時代辦周侃公使會面，感謝他支持香港特別行政區政府的工作。他提到，律政司正全力支持內企借港出海，約兩個月前更推出「香港專業服務出海平台」及《香港專業服務助力中國內地企業出海成功案例實錄》，而此行他亦到訪一家借助香港專業服務成功出海並立足印尼的內地投資企業，與管理層就平台支持內企的措施交換意見。

張國鈞亦會晤印尼僱主協會主席Shinta Widjaja Kamdani。他表示，香港在「一國兩制」下擁有國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，歡迎印尼商界善用香港優質的專業服務，包括國際法律及金融服務，在香港設立區域業務總部，開拓「一帶一路」及粵港澳大灣區的機遇。

此外，張國鈞與來自印尼和鄰近地區的工商、金融、創科領袖共進午餐，就香港專業服務如何更好促進香港與印尼之間的商業聯繫和合作互相交流。

傍晚，他出席香港駐雅加達經濟貿易辦事處（駐雅加達經貿辦）舉辦的新春酒會，向逾百名當地政商、學術、文化和傳媒人士發表演說，鼓勵他們新一年充分利用香港的優勢發掘更多商機、探索更多合作，並深化香港和印尼的夥伴關係。

酒會前，駐雅加達經貿辦處長鄭青文向張國鈞簡介經貿辦工作。她表示，香港駐吉隆坡經貿辦已於去年十二月成立，進一步加強香港與東盟各國的關係。她指，印尼是東盟最大經濟體，駐雅加達經貿辦會繼續深化在當地的推廣工作，推動兩地經貿和人文聯繫。

明日（二月十一日），張國鈞將到訪印尼中國商會總會，隨後結束訪問行程啟程回港。"
"DSJ promotes Hong Kong's common law system and strengths in legal, financial and other professional services in Indonesia (with photos)",2026-02-10 20:18,2026-02-10 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000763.htm,"The Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, attended an international forum in Jakarta, Indonesia, today (February 10) and met with local political and business leaders to promote Hong Kong's advantages in legal, financial, and other professional services under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. He emphasised that Hong Kong would continue to play the role of ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to strengthen ties between the Chinese Mainland and member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

In the morning, Dr Cheung attended the China Conference: Southeast Asia 2026, where he shared insights with political and business communities on how Hong Kong's unique strengths can help consolidate and develop economic and trade partnerships with fast-growing economies like Indonesia.

Dr Cheung noted that Hong Kong's distinctive advantages could be highlighted in four aspects. First, ""irreplaceable""; Hong Kong serves as an irreplaceable bridge for Indonesian and ASEAN enterprises looking to the market of the Chinese Mainland, and for Chinese companies venturing into Southeast Asia's markets. Second, ""interconnected""; as an international financial centre, Hong Kong is deeply interconnected in financial, legal, and other professional fields, reflecting the international best practice. Third, ""innovative""; Hong Kong keeps abreast of innovative policies, supporting the development of different industry sectors. For example, initiatives enabling multinational corporations to relocate their domicile to Hong Kong and enjoy the city's simple and low tax regime. Fourth, ""indispensable""; the common law system is a cornerstone of Hong Kong's success. With a robust rule of law environment, a bilingual common law system which is internationally compatible as well as clear and transparent laws, Hong Kong is an indispensable international legal hub offering strong and reliable legal support for sophisticated cross-border investments.

Dr Cheung said that Hong Kong stood ready to collaborate with Indonesia and other ASEAN countries by leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages to promote shared prosperity across Asia.

During the Conference, Dr Cheung met with the Chargé d'Affaires ad Interim of the Embassy to the People’s Republic of China to the Republic of Indonesia, Mr Zhou Kan. Dr Cheung expressed gratitude to Mr Zhou for his support on the work of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government. Dr Cheung remarked that the Department of Justice had been fully supporting Mainland enterprises in leveraging Hong Kong to go global and rolled out the Hong Kong Professional Services GoGlobal Platform and the ""Collection of Success Stories: Hong Kong's Professional Services Supporting Chinese Mainland Enterprises Going Global"" about two months ago. During the visit, Dr Cheung also visited a Mainland-invested enterprise which had leveraged Hong Kong's professional services to go global successfully in Indonesia. He exchanged views with their senior management on the measures of the Platform in supporting Mainland enterprises.

Dr Cheung also met with the Chairwoman of the Indonesian Employers' Association, Ms Shinta Widjaja Kamdani. Dr Cheung indicated that Hong Kong enjoyed both China advantages and international advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle. He encouraged Indonesian businesses to leverage the city's high-quality professional services, including international legal and financial services, to set up regional business headquarters in Hong Kong and to seize new opportunities under the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development.

In addition, Dr Cheung had a luncheon with leaders from the commercial, financial, and innovation and technology sectors in Indonesia and nearby regions to exchange views on how to better facilitate commercial ties and collaboration between Hong Kong and Indonesia.

In the evening, Dr Cheung attended a Chinese New Year cocktail reception hosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO) in Jakarta. Dr Cheung delivered a speech to over 100 guests from the local government, business, academic, cultural and media sectors. He encouraged them to fully leverage Hong Kong's advantages to explore more business opportunities and strengthen collaboration in the new year, and to deepen the partnership between Hong Kong and Indonesia.

Before the reception, the Director-General of the HKETO in Jakarta, Miss Libera Cheng, updated Dr Cheung on the HKETO's work. She said that the establishment of the HKETO in Kuala Lumpur in December 2025 has further strengthened Hong Kong's relations with ASEAN countries. With Indonesia being ASEAN's largest economy, the HKETO in Jakarta will continue to enhance promotion work in the region, with a view to fostering bilateral economic, trade and people-to-people ties.

Dr Cheung will visit the China Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia tomorrow (February 11) before concluding his visit and returning to Hong Kong."

Speech by CE at SCMP China Conference: Southeast Asia 2026 (English only) (with video),2026-02-10 19:00,2026-02-10 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000305.htm,"Following is the video speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at theSCMP China Conference: Southeast Asia 2026 today (February 10):

Your Excellency Hashim Djojohadikusumo (Special Envoy of the President of the Republic of Indonesia for Climate and Energy), Honourable Mr C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Ms Tammy Tam (Publisher of the South China Morning Post), distinguished guests, officials and friends from Indonesia, ladies and gentlemen,

  Hello from Hong Kong. I am glad to join you today at the China Conference: Southeast Asia 2026 organised by the South China Morning Post.

  Held for the very first time in Jakarta, this conference brings together 500 guests coming from some 20 countries and regions, as well as over 40 speakers from the government, the industry, and various different sectors. As you would agree with me, this year's conference has addressed some of the most pressing issues shaping Asia's future, like global supply chains, digital innovation and wealth management.

  I congratulate the South China Morning Post for bringing this meaningful conference to Indonesia, which is home to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat and a key power in the vibrant ASEAN community, which now counts 11 member states.

  ASEAN has long been a close friend of Hong Kong. Since 2010, ASEAN has been our second-largest merchandise trade partner. Our merchandise trade saw a robust 14 per cent growth in 2024. And in just the first 11 months of 2025, our merchandise trade had grown by 28 per cent, year on year. At last count, in 2023, our bilateral services trade with ASEAN hit a record high, amounting to US$18.4 billion. That makes ASEAN our third-largest trading partner in services.

  That's certainly helped by the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Agreement between Hong Kong and ASEAN. Since entering into force in 2021, the agreements have provided the certainty, and protection, that businesses look for. Indeed, since the signing of the agreements, Hong Kong's outward investment into ASEAN has recorded a 54 per cent growth. Meanwhile, the number of offices in Hong Kong with parent companies located in ASEAN has risen by 42 per cent.

  All these healthy figures demonstrate the success of our shared commitment to deepening regional co-operation. I'm pleased to add that we will increase our annual contribution to the Economic and Technical Co-operation Work Programme, under the FTA (free trade agreement), by 20 per cent, to better support our small and medium-sized enterprises. We are also looking into how Hong Kong and ASEAN could connect our trade single windows, to facilitate electronic exchange of trade documents.

  The resounding success of our FTA with ASEAN is testament to our shared commitment to free trade. Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is both committed, and most ready, to bring our relationship with ASEAN to the next level. We look forward to Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) - the largest free trade agreement in the world.

  Last year, member economies have adopted the terms of reference of the Accession Working Group. At the 5th RCEP Summit held last October, RCEP leaders, including ASEAN's, unanimously pledged to advance the RCEP accession process.

  Hong Kong warmly welcomes the progress. As the world's freest economy, Hong Kong has plenty to contribute to the Partnership. Under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that maintains unparalleled connectivity with both the Chinese Mainland and the world. We boast a long tradition of the rule of law, a common law system that resembles most global financial hubs, a simple and law tax regime, and a versatile and professional workforce.

  I am thankful to Indonesia, as well as other ASEAN states, for the unwavering support to us in driving forward the accession process. We look forward to the RCEP's next major milestone in setting up the Accession Working Group, and your continuous support in Hong Kong's accession bid.

  Amid mounting geopolitical tensions, the world is seeking safe and stable sources of investments and economic partners. Meanwhile, many enterprises in China, our country, are looking to expand their business in overseas markets.

  That's why Hong Kong has set up a GoGlobal Task Force last October, to help Mainland enterprises tap into the global market. It will connect Mainland enterprises with emerging markets, those in Southeast Asia very much included, and enhance two-way investment flow. All while leveraging Hong Kong's global network and world-class professional services. Yes, we are happy to do our part in promoting regional co-operation, and bringing about prosperity for all.

  In a week, we will be celebrating the Year of the Horse. The horse symbolises vitality and bravery. I wish you all a successful, and energetic, break from the gate in the new year. Enjoy the conference. Thank you."
兩名非法勞工被判入獄,2026-02-10 18:55,2026-02-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000694.htm,"兩名持擔保書的菲律賓籍非法勞工於昨日（二月九日）在沙田裁判法院被判入獄。

入境事務處（入境處）調查人員於二○二五年三月四日的反非法勞工行動中，在葵涌一所工業大廈內拘捕兩名年齡分別為四十二及四十五歲菲律賓籍男子。被捕時，他們正在從事搬運工作。在檢查身分證明文件期間，他們出示由入境處簽發不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），及後的調查發現他們均為免遣返聲請人士。

被捕的非法勞工於昨日在沙田裁判法院被控受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限下，接受僱傭工作。經審訊後，他們被判監禁二十二個月及十五日。

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口及／或強迫勞動指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口及／或強迫勞動的元素。被識別的販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口及／或強迫勞動受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
Two illegal workers jailed,2026-02-10 18:55,2026-02-10 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000697.htm,"Two Filipino illegal workers, holding recognisance forms, were jailed by the Shatin Magistrates' Courts yesterday (February 9).

During an anti-illegal worker operation conducted by the Immigration Department (ImmD) on March 4, 2025, investigators raided an industrial building in Kwai Chung. Two Filipino men, aged 42 and 45, were arrested while loading goods. Upon identity checking, they produced for inspection recognisance forms issued by the ImmD, which prohibit them from taking employment. Further investigation revealed that they were non-refoulement claimants.

The illegal workers were charged at the Shatin Magistrates' Courts yesterday with taking employment while being a person in respect of whom a removal order or deportation order was in force. After trial, they were both sentenced to 22 months and 15 days' imprisonment.

The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) and/or forced labour victims. When any TIP and/or forced labour indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP and/or forced labour elements. Identified TIP and/or forced labour victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP and/or forced labour victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."
First northbound transfer drill for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in GBA conducted smoothly (with photos),2026-02-10 18:18,2026-02-10 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000671.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government, in collaboration with the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government, conducted the first northbound transfer drill for the Pilot Scheme for Direct Cross-boundary Ambulance Transfer in the Greater Bay Area (Pilot Scheme) today (February 10) to test the route and immigration arrangements under the simulated transfer of patients by cross-boundary ambulance from Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) to the University of Hong Kong - Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZH).

  During the drill, the Shenzhen ambulance departed from HKU-SZH and travelled to the designated Hong Kong sending hospital (i.e. QEH) via Shenzhen Bay Port to pick up the patient, and then transferred the patient back to HKU-SZH via the same port for treatment. The testing process was smooth.

  In his 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive has announced that the HKSAR Government will, in collaboration with the governments of Guangdong and Macao, extend the cross-boundary ambulance transfer arrangements in an orderly manner, including the expansion to cover designated hospitals in Zhuhai and Nansha, as well as two-way transfers. The Pilot Scheme (southbound transfer) has been officially extended from Shenzhen and Macao to Zhuhai and Nansha since November 9, 2025.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said, ""The successful conduction of the first northbound transfer drill from Hong Kong to Shenzhen by the government departments of Guangdong and Hong Kong has laid the foundation for extending the Pilot Scheme to a two-way transfer arrangement. The HKSAR Government will continue to maintain close communication and co-operation with relevant Mainland authorities, expecting to officially implement the two-way transfer of the direct cross-boundary ambulance transfer within the first quarter of this year. This will expedite the actualisation of a high degree of healthcare integration within the Greater Bay Area and promote the high-quality development of a 'Healthy Bay Area'.""

  The overall operation of the Pilot Scheme has been smooth since its implementation from November 30, 2024. The Pilot Scheme will be extended until November 29 this year, and subsequent arrangements will be announced at an appropriate juncture. To date, 23 patients have been transferred from designated sending hospitals in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Nansha, and Macao (i.e. HKU-SZH, Zhuhai People's Hospital, Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, and Conde S. Januario Hospital of Macao) to designated public hospitals in Hong Kong for treatment. According to professional medical assessments, the patients concerned have a need for continuous hospitalisation for treatment. Their conditions were relatively stable, but they were unable to cross the boundary on their own and were unsuitable for transfer to an ambulance via the existing boundary control points."

Hong Kong Customs dismantles two illegal fueling stations (with photos),2026-02-10 18:05,2026-02-10 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000639.htm,"  Hong Kong Customs yesterday (February 9) mounted territory-wide surprise inspections targeting illicit fuel activities and detected two related cases, seizing a total of about 1 400 litres of suspected illicit motor spirit with an estimated market value of about $42,000 and a duty potential of about $8,700. Two persons were arrested and one vehicle involved in a case was detained.

  Yesterday afternoon, Customs officers shut down an illegal fueling station inside a metal shed near the roadside in Tung Chung during a patrol. About 600 litres of suspected illicit motor spirit and a batch of filling equipment were seized. An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

  Moreover, Customs officers conducted an anti-illicit fuel operation in Fo Tan yesterday night and dismantled an illegal fueling station on a remote roadside. About 800 litres of suspected illicit motor spirit and a batch of filling equipment were seized. Two men, one believed to be the operator of the illegal fueling station, aged 38, and a private car driver coming for fueling, aged 32, were arrested. The private car was also detained.

  The two arrested persons were charged with illegal dealing with dutiable commodities.

  Customs will continue to carry out stringent enforcement action and step up inspections to combat illegal fuel activities. Members of the public are also urged not to patronise illegal fueling stations. The use of illicit fuel is a criminal offence, and vehicles involved may be liable to confiscation.

  According to the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance, any vehicle found conveying illicit motor spirit, as well as any tools, equipment, or articles used or intended to be used in connection with the commission of related offences, shall be liable to forfeiture whether or not any person is convicted of any offence. Anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit motor spirit commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

演練期間深方救護車先從港大深圳醫院出發，經深圳灣口岸前往香港指定派送醫院（即伊利沙伯醫院）接載病人，再經同一口岸將病人轉運至港大深圳醫院接受治療，測試過程暢順。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-10 17:30,2026-02-10 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000603.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 10), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.​

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

保安局局長在立法會保安事務委員會會議就建議將消防處一個消防總長編外職位轉為常額職位開場發言（只有中文）,2026-02-10 17:11,2026-02-10 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000602.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（二月十日）出席立法會保安事務委員會會議就建議將消防處一個消防總長編外職位轉為常額職位的開場發言︰

主席：

政府建議把消防處一個消防總長、首長級有時限編外職位，即助理處長（新界南），轉為常額職位，務求可以持續加強新界南行動總區的指揮、督導和管理能力。

新界幅員佔全港超過六成，人口亦超過全港一半。隨着北部都會區、東涌新市鎮擴展等重點發展項目全速推進，緊急服務需求將會持續和結構性增加。如果只由一位助理處長統領整個新界區的行動工作，並不能配合新界區的規模和風險形勢。因此，我們早於五年前將新界區劃分為新界南和新界北兩個總區，並開設助理處長（新界南）一職，確保兩個總區都有助理處長督導各項工作。

事實上，立法會保安事務委員會早於二○二○年已經支持我們開設常額的助理處長（新界南）職位。其後，政府考慮到當時疫情以及經濟下滑，決定暫緩所有開設常額首長級職位的申請，即使經評估確認有迫切需要，亦會先以有時限編外職位方式處理。最終，我們獲批開設一個為期五年的助理處長（新界南）職位。

過去五年，新界兩個總區人口持續增長，加上各項大型基建和發展項目相繼落成，兩個總區於人手編制、服務範圍和事故處理量等方面的規模，現時已大致與港島和九龍總區看齊。過去五年的運作經驗亦充分反映，由兩名助理處長分別掌管新界兩個總區，才可以有效應對新界地區規模大、風險場景多、事故類型複雜的運作需要。所以，我們建議將這個職位轉為常額，以確保領導工作可以延續和保持穩定。

就風險和工作性質而言，新界南行動總區涵蓋香港國際機場，以及港珠澳大橋、青馬大橋等重要基建；一旦發生事故，都可能是需要跨部門高度協調的重大事件。同時，新界南亦覆蓋廣泛郊野和偏遠地帶，加上極端天氣越來越頻密，攀山拯救、水域／沿岸事故、水浸和風暴相關行動，對指揮調度、資源配置和安全管理的要求都更高。另一方面，遇到嚴重事故，助理處長亦要到場親自指揮，確保行動快速、有效和安全。過去三年，兩個新界總區的助理處長出動指揮行動多達29次，比港島和九龍總區的總和更多。

自職位設立以來，助理處長（新界南）亦於多項關鍵工作發揮領導作用：包括統籌香港國際機場三跑道系統相關消防規劃和落實、監督新建機場消防局按時投入運作；同時推動跨境應急合作和科技應用，例如在《粵港澳應急管理合作暨大灣區應急救援行動合作框架協議》之下參與策略協調，以及出任消防處低空經濟督導委員會主席，統籌無人機應用和相關應變策略，提升行動效能。

總結過去五年的運作經驗，助理處長（新界南）一直承擔關鍵的策略督導、指揮和管理工作，並與區內人士保持密切聯繫，積極統籌推動區內的社區消防安全工作。隨着新界南人口持續增長、重大基建發展、郊野和極端天氣救援需求上升等長期結構性需求，我們確實有需要將這個職位轉為常額，以鞏固首長級領導支援。

如果未能落實，我們只可以回復到五年前的架構，由一位助理處長統籌整個新界區的消防行動工作。這樣不單會嚴重影響相關工作的延續性和穩定性，亦會明顯削弱新界消防工作的督導和指揮效能，令新界的滅火和救援表現受損，並對行政管理、策略制訂和社區發展等方面造成廣泛不利的影響。

有關建議的詳細資料，已經載於我們早前提交的文件內。歡迎委員提出意見。多謝主席。"
全港首個由油站轉型的油電站啓用（附圖）,2026-02-10 16:44,2026-02-10 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000479.htm,"全港首個由油站轉型、位於鑽石山蒲崗村道的油電站今日（二月十日）啓用。此乃政府透過調整油站土地契約條款，向油站營運商提供誘因，推動現有油站加裝電動車充電設施的油電站。

該油電站位於鑽石山豐盛街五號，二十四小時運作，除現有提供的車用燃油加油服務及車用石油氣加氣服務外，已新增兩支輸出功率120千瓦的高速充電樁供電動車使用。為便利商用車充電，該兩支高速充電樁會於每日下午三至六時（即一般的士「交更」時段）預留給電動的士及電動公共小巴使用。

環境及生態局副局長黃淑嫻為油電站啓動禮主禮致辭時表示，傳統燃油車輛轉型為電動車已是大勢所趨，為有效利用現有油站用地為電動車提供充電服務，政府正逐步將部分現有的油站轉型至純充電站或油電站，以支持充電設施更多樣化，配合不同種類電動車的高速充電需要。

為推動車輛綠色轉型，並在二○五○年前達致車輛零排放的目標，政府已宣布在二○三五年或以前停止新登記燃油私家車（包括混合動力車）。為配合電動車持續增長帶來的充電需求，政府正多管齊下，積極完善充電網絡，目標是在二○三五年提供約一萬支高速充電樁。政府會繼續善用全港現有油站用地，與油站營運商、電力公司及相關持份者共同促進及推動現有油站加裝充電設施。

為鼓勵的士及公共小巴車主加快轉型至電動的士及電動公共小巴，參考現時專用石油氣加氣站的安排，各指定油電站將對電動的士及電動公共小巴設立充電上限價格機制，營運商將不能向電動的士及電動公共小巴收取高於環境保護署（環保署）每月公布的充電上限價格，而其他電動車的充電價格則由市場釐定。有關電動的士及電動公共小巴充電上限價格的計算方法，可參閱環境及生態局網站（www.eeb.gov.hk/tc/resources_publications/guidelines/index.html）。」

充電上限價格詳情已張貼於油電站，亦會在環保署網站（www.epd.gov.hk）定期公布，方便業界監察充電價格變動。"
Hong Kong's first petrol-cum-charging station converted from petrol filling station opens (with photos),2026-02-10 16:44,2026-02-10 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000481.htm,"Located in Diamond Hill, Hong Kong's first petrol-cum-charging station (PCS) converted from a petrol filling station (PFS), Po Kong Village Road PCS opens today (February 10). The opening of this PCS is through the Government's incentive for PFS operators by adjusting land lease terms of PFSs to promote installing retrofitting electric vehicle (EV) charging facilities at existing PFSs.

The PCS is located at 5 Fung Shing Street, Diamond Hill, and operates 24 hours a day. In addition to the existing auto-fuel and auto-liquefied petroleum gas filling services, it has added two new fast chargers of 120 kW output power for the use of EVs. To facilitate the charging of commercial vehicles, the two fast chargers are reserved for use by electric taxis (e-taxis) and electric public light buses (e-PLBs) from 3pm to 6pm daily, i.e. general shift-change period for taxis.

Officiating at the PCS launch ceremony, the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Miss Diane Wong, said that the transformation from conventional fuel-propelled vehicles to EVs has become a trend. To make the effective use of existing PFS sites to provide charging services for EVs, the Government is gradually converting some existing PFSs into charging stations or PCSs to support more diversified charging facilities and to meet the fast-charging needs of different types of EVs.
 ​
To promote the green transformation of vehicles and to achieve zero vehicular emissions before 2050, the Government has announced ceasing new registrations of fuel-propelled private cars (including hybrid vehicles) in 2035 or earlier. To cope with charging demands from the continuous growth of EVs, the Government is taking a multipronged approach to enhancing the charging network, aiming to provide approximately 10 000 fast chargers by 2035. The Government will continue to make good use of the existing PFS sites in Hong Kong, and work with PFS operators, power companies and relevant stakeholders to facilitate and promote retrofitting charging facilities at existing PFSs.

In order to encourage owners of taxis and public light buses to expedite the adoption of e-taxis and e-PLBs, and by reference to the current arrangement of dedicated liquefied petroleum gas filling stations, a charging ceiling price mechanism will be established for e-taxis and e-PLBs at designated PCSs. The operators cannot charge a price that is higher than the ceiling price to be announced by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on a monthly basis. The charging price for other EVs will be determined by the market.

胡賢政董事（紫荊文化集團董事）、鄧中華會長（國務院港澳事務辦公室原副主任、全國港澳研究會會長）、李慧琼主席（全國人大常委會委員、立法會主席）、各位領導、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好！十分感謝紫荊雜誌社邀請我出席第十屆「一國兩制」與基本法研討會。

今天研討會的主題是「落實行政主導提高治理效能推動高質量發展」。這個主題定得非常合時。香港正值「由治及興」新階段，國家「十五五」規劃亦即將出台，如何提高治理效能，推動高質量發展，是參與香港管治者的必答題。夏寶龍主任在上月二十六日發表的重要講話，清晰及詳細解釋，堅持和完善行政主導，就是這條必答題的答案。

雖然行政主導這四個字沒有出現在《基本法》中，但這是《基本法》第四章訂下有關香港特區政治體制最精準的表述和總結。準確落實行政主導，就是依法辦事。

行政主導的核心是行政長官。他是香港特區首長，亦是特區行政機關的首長，所以是雙首長。他需要同時對中央人民政府和特區負責，所以是雙負責。他是連接中央和特區的重要樞紐，是中央全面管治權和特區高度自治權有機結合的關鍵。故此，《基本法》第48條特別賦予行政長官重要職能。

在行政主導下，就行政和立法關係，行政處於主動和主導地位，例如政府擁有絕大部分立法的創議權，涉及公共開支、政治體制及政府運作方面的法律草案，只能由政府提出。但不否認行政與立法之間存在制衡關係，《基本法》第64條便說明特區政府必須對立法會負責，執行立法會通過並已生效的法例，定期向立法會作《施政報告》，答覆立法會議員的質詢，徵稅和公共開支需經立法會批准。

就行政與司法關係，落實行政主導，絕非要否定司法獨立。《基本法》明確授予特區獨立的司法權和終審權。剛提及的《基本法》第64條訂明特區政府必須遵守法律，而《基本法》第35條規定香港居民有權對行政部門和行政人員的行為向法院提起訴訟；在涉及政府的訴訟，法院當然要依法行使獨立審判權。但必須留意，行政長官在司法機關的運作中有其獨特和重要角色。首先，法官的任免至為關鍵，《基本法》第48（6）條賦予行政長官其中一項職權，就是依照法定程序任免各級法院法官；《基本法》第88條規定特區的法官，根據法官和法律界和其他知名人士組成的獨立委員會推薦，由行政長官任命；《基本法》第89條則訂明，法官在無力履行職責或行為不檢的情況下，行政長官可根據法官組成的審議庭的建議，予以免職。就具體個別情況，司法機關亦必須依法遵從行政長官的意見。例如，《基本法》第19條規定，法院對國防、外交等國家行為無管轄權，如在審理案件中遇到有涉及國防、外交等國家行為的事實問題，應取得行政長官就該問題發出的證明文件，而該文件對法院有約束力。整體而言，正如夏寶龍主任說，「司法機關要依法獨立行使審判權，完善司法制度，提升司法效率，維護好國家根本利益和特別行政區整體利益。」

行政主導的重點在於雖然行政、立法、司法機關各有分工，但根本目的是一樣，就是為了廣大市民的根本福祉和香港的整體利益，這就是「同唱一台戲」。 一齣高水平、高票房的好戲，需要有不同演員，各自做好自己的角色，與其他演員建立良好的互動和默契，同心合力講好故事。我認為我們要合力講好的故事有一個簡單的名字，就是「美好的香港」。

堅持和完善行政主導是確保「一國兩制」行穩致遠的關鍵。我期望、也十分有信心，通過今天的研討會，大家對行政主導會有更深入的理解；在此，我祝願今天的研討會圓滿成功。

下星期馬年來臨，春風得意馬蹄疾，我也在此祝願國家和香港特區欣欣向榮，大家身體健康、生活愉快！謝謝！"

二零二六年一月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2026-02-10 16:30,2026-02-10 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000476.htm,"政府統計處今日（二月十日）發表二零二六年一月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年十二月在收縮區域的44.9下跌至二零二六年一月的43.4，而未來一個月（即二零二六年二月）的業務收益展望動向指數為46.4。按行業分析，不少統計調查涵蓋的行業的業務收益現時動向指數在二零二六年一月較上月下跌，特別是零售業（從42.1下跌至38.4）及批發業（從44.3下跌至40.7）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年十二月的47.7下跌至二零二六年一月的46.0，而未來一個月（即二零二六年二月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.1。

評論

政府發言人表示，一月中小企業務收益的現時和展望動向指數在過去數月大致錄得改善後稍為回落。同月中小企就業人數的現時動向指數亦較之前一個月輕微回落。

展望未來，香港經濟持續擴張應為本地營商氣氛帶來支持。然而，國際環境依然複雜，政府會繼續密切監察事態的演變。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指從業人數少於50人的公司。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於規模較大的公司的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己公司情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for January 2026,2026-02-10 16:30,2026-02-10 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/10/P2026021000485.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (February 10) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for January 2026.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs decreased from 44.9 in December 2025 in the contractionary zone to 43.4 in January 2026, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. February 2026) outlook DI on business receipts was 46.4. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts for a number of surveyed sectors dropped in January 2026 as compared with previous month, particularly for the retail trade (from 42.1 to 38.4) and wholesale trade (from 44.3 to 40.7).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades decreased from 47.7 in December 2025 to 46.0 in January 2026, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. February 2026) was 47.1.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that the current and outlook diffusion indices on business receipts for SMEs in January eased somewhat, following general improvements in the past months. The current diffusion index on employment for SMEs in the same month also recorded a slight moderation from the preceding month.

  Looking ahead, sustained economic expansion in Hong Kong should help bolster local business sentiment. However, the international environment remains complicated, and the Government will continue to closely monitor the evolving developments.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to companies with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent companies in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).
