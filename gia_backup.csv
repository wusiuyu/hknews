衞生署公布退伍軍人病個案最新情況,2026-01-26 17:00,2026-01-26 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600430.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月二十六日）公布退伍軍人病個案最新數字，並提醒市民應使用和保養妥善設計的人造供水系統，易受感染人士則需時刻採取相關預防措施。

在一月十八日至二十四日期間，中心錄得一宗社區感染退伍軍人病個案，涉及一名有長期病患的77歲女病人，她居於灣仔區。

​中心正展開流行病學調查，以找出可能的感染源頭和高風險接觸因素。初步調查顯示上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示這宗個案與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至一月二十四日，今年錄得五宗退伍軍人病案。本港於二○二五年及二○二四年分別錄得167及135宗退伍軍人病個案。

男士、50歲以上人士、吸煙人士、酗酒人士和免疫力弱的人士均較易感染退伍軍人病。另外，有些情況也可能增加患病風險，包括供水系統保養欠佳、居所使用舊式供水系統或附近設有冷卻水塔或噴水池、使用電熱水器、按摩池或溫泉，以及近期曾到酒店或船隻。

退伍軍人桿菌可存在於多種環境，尤其適合在攝氏20至45度的溫水生長。它可存活在不同水源環境，如水缸、冷熱水系統、冷卻水塔、按摩池、噴水池、加濕器和家居呼吸道醫療器材等。病人有機會因吸入人工製水系統釋出受污染的水點和霧氣而受感染。在處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土時亦可能受感染。

免疫力弱的人士應：


以無菌水或經煮沸的水飲用、刷牙及漱口；
避免使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備；及
如要使用加濕器或其他可產生霧氣的設備，應使用無菌水或煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，不應直接從水龍頭注水入盛水器。此外，應按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養加濕器或設備，不要讓設備儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水。


​市民應採取以下健康建議：


注意個人衞生；
不要吸煙和避免飲酒；
定期或按製造商建議的次數，為水龍頭及花灑頭的隔濾器進行檢查、清潔、除垢及消毒；
如果食水系統保養妥善，無需安裝家庭式濾水器。由於濾水器容易堵塞而滋生微生物，故不建議使用。若選擇使用濾水器，孔徑大小應為0.2微米或以下，並必須按照製造商的建議定期更換濾芯；
至少每季排走大廈水缸的存水一次，並清洗水缸；
每星期或在使用前為不常使用的出水口（如水龍頭、淋浴噴頭、熱水出水口等）和喉管內有水滯留的地方排水，或沖洗至少一分鐘；
使用和保養家居呼吸道醫療器材時，需諮詢和跟從醫生專業意見，並只可用無菌水（非蒸餾水或水龍頭食水）清洗和注入容器。按照製造商的指示定期清洗及保養器材。清洗或消毒後，應用無菌水、煮沸後剛冷卻的食水，或經0.2微米孔徑濾水器過濾的水沖洗器材。切勿讓器材儲存積水。每日傾倒盛水器的水，然後抹乾容器的所有表面，並且換水；及
如需處理花園土壤、堆肥和培養土：


戴上手套及口罩；
應使用低水壓灌溉花園和堆肥；
慢慢開啓培養土的包裝袋，並確保開口遠離面部；
為盆栽移盆時可將泥土弄濕，以免塵土飛揚；及
避免在通風較差的環境工作，如密封的溫室。


市民可參閱衞生防護中心退伍軍人病專頁、預防退伍軍人病委員會「預防退伍軍人病工作守則」及「適用於樓宇管理的冷熱水系統內務管理指引」；及衞生防護中心防控退伍軍人病的風險為本策略。

此外，由於吸煙和酗酒人士較易感染退伍軍人病，政府呼籲市民不要吸煙和避免飲酒。市民可致電衞生署綜合戒煙熱線1833 183由註冊護士提供接聽服務，為吸煙者進行專業戒煙輔導，並可轉介至多元化的免費戒煙服務。市民亦可瀏覽戒煙專題網頁（www.livetobaccofree.hk）以獲取更多戒煙相關資訊。衞生署亦已推出「戒酒輔導服務先導計劃」，透過受資助的非政府機構東華三院，為被識別為懷疑有酒精依賴的人士提供免費輔導。衞生署「活出健康新方向」網站已上載有關服務的簡介，有興趣參與先導計劃的合資格人士可致電東華三院查詢熱線（2884 9876）。"

DH announces latest situation of Legionnaires' disease cases,2026-01-26 17:00,2026-01-26 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600431.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 26) reported the latest number of Legionnaires' disease (LD) cases, and reminded the public of the importance of using and maintaining properly designed man-made water systems, adding that susceptible groups should strictly observe relevant precautions.

  From January 18 to 24, the CHP recorded one community-acquired LD case, involving a 77-year old female patient living in Wan Chai District who had underlying illnesses.

​​The CHP is conducting epidemiological investigations to identify potential sources of infection and high-risk exposure. Initial investigations revealed that this is a sporadic case. No epidemiological linkages have been established between thiscommunity-acquired case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

  As of January 24, five LD cases had been recorded this year. In 2025 and 2024, there were 167 and 135 LD cases respectively.

Men, people aged over 50, smokers, alcoholics and persons with weakened immunity are more susceptible to LD. Some situations may also increase the risk of infection, including poor maintenance of water systems; living in areas with old water systems, cooling towers or fountains; using electric water heaters, whirlpool spas or hot water spring spas; and recent stays in hotels or ships.

Legionellae are found in various environmental settings and grow well in warm water (20 to 45 degrees Celsius). They can be found in aqueous environments such as water tanks, hot and cold water systems, cooling towers, whirlpool spas, water fountains, humidifiers and home respiratory devices that support breathing. People may become infected when they breathe in contaminated droplets (aerosols) and mist generated by artificial water systems, or when handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes.

Immunocompromised persons should:


Use sterile or boiled water for drinking, tooth brushing and mouth rinsing;
Avoid using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices; and
If using humidifiers, or other mist- or aerosol-generating devices, fill the water tank with only sterile or cooled freshly boiled water, and not water directly from the tap. Also, clean and maintain humidifiers/devices regularly according to manufacturers' instructions. Never leave stagnant water in a humidifier/device. Empty the water tank, wipe all surfaces dry, and change the water daily.


The public should observe the health advice below:


Observe personal hygiene;
Do not smoke and avoid alcohol consumption;
Strainers in water taps and shower heads should be inspected, cleaned, descaled and disinfected regularly or at a frequency recommended by the manufacturer;
If a fresh-water plumbing system is properly maintained, it is not necessary to install domestic water filters. Use of water filters is not encouraged as clogging occurs easily, which can promote growth of micro-organisms. In case water filters are used, the pore size should be 0.2 micrometres (µm) or less and the filter needs to be changed periodically according to the manufacturer's recommendations;
Drain and clean water tanks of buildings at least quarterly;
Drain or purge for at least one minute infrequently used water outlets (e.g. water taps, shower heads and hot water outlets) and stagnant points of the pipework weekly or before use;
Seek and follow doctors' professional advice regarding the use and maintenance of home respiratory devices and use only sterile water (not distilled or tap water) to clean and fill the reservoir. Clean and maintain the device regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cleaning/disinfection, rinse the device with sterile water, cooled freshly boiled water or water filtered with 0.2 µm filters. Never leave stagnant water in the device. Empty the water tank, keep all surfaces dry, and change the water daily; and
When handling garden soil, compost and potting mixes:


Wear gloves and a face mask;
Water gardens and compost gently using low pressure;
Open composted potting mixes slowly and make sure the opening is directed away from the face;
Wet the soil to reduce dust when potting plants; and
Avoid working in poorly ventilated places such as enclosed greenhouses.


​The public may visit the CHP'sLD page, theCode of Practice for Prevention of LDand theHousekeeping Guidelines for Cold and Hot Water Systems for Building Managementof the Prevention of LD Committee, and the CHP'srisk-based strategyfor prevention and control of LD.

Additionally, as smokers and alcoholics are more susceptible to LD, the Government urgesmembers of the public to quit smoking and avoid drinking. Members of the public may call the DH Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline at 1833 183, which is answered by registered nurses who provide professional counselling and referral to a wide range of free smoking cessation services. The public may also visit the smoking cessation thematic website (www.livetobaccofree.hk) for more information on smoking cessation. The DH has also launched the Pilot Alcohol Cessation Counselling Service, which provides free counselling to people identified as having probable alcohol dependence, through a subvented non-governmental organisation, the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals (TWGHs). Information on the service has been uploaded to the DH'sChange for Healthwebsite. Eligible persons who are interested can call the enquiry hotline of the TWGHs (2884 9876)."
Speech by FS at Asian Financial Forum Keynote Luncheon (English only) (with photo/video),2026-01-26 16:08,2026-01-26 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600504.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at Asian Financial Forum Keynote Luncheon today (January 26):

Dr Barroso (Former President of the European Commission and former Prime Minister of Portugal, Dr José Manuel Barroso), Fred (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Professor Frederick Ma), your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is my honour to welcome you to this year's Asian Financial Forum Luncheon.

  Let me begin by extending a very warm welcome to Dr José Manuel Barroso, who will deliver today's keynote address. Dr Barroso served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 2002 to 2004 and as President of the European Commission from 2004 to 2014. His presence here is particularly timely. At a moment when Europe stands at a geopolitical crossroads - navigating rising tensions and a shifting transatlantic dynamic - we look forward to Dr Barroso's insights on developments not only across Europe, but also for the world at large.

Reflections from Davos

  Ladies and gentlemen, we are living through an era of profound complexity and transformation. Having just returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, I can attest to the deep sense of reflection shared among global leaders. While opinions may diverge on many fronts, there is a striking convergence on one point: the world is becoming increasingly unfamiliar. Longstanding allies stand at the risk of becoming adversaries. The very principles that underpin the international order for eight decades - sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the authority of the United Nations - are being openly denounced.

  Some speak of the end of the rules-based international order. Others push for Europe's independence. Yet the underlying message is clear: countries are reassessing their economic and security relationships, seeking to build strategic resilience, and adapting to a more fragmented global environment.

  A key theme emerging from Davos was diversification - across trade, supply chains and finance. Faced with growing uncertainty, economies are striving to forge new partnerships and gain access to alternative markets.

China's opportunities

  It is against this backdrop that China's role becomes particularly relevant.

  In a world marked by volatility and unilateralism, China offers a high degree of stability and predictability. At the World Economic Forum, Vice Premier He Lifeng reaffirmed China's unwavering commitment to openness and co-operation, emphasising that reform and opening-up remain fundamental pillars of national policy. He also reiterated China's support for free trade, multilateralism, and mutual respect.

  These are not aspirational statements. They signal policy continuity and consistency, qualities that are vital for global investors and businesses.

  Looking ahead, China's development will continue to create substantial opportunities for the world. Two areas are particularly notable.

  First, China's medium-to-long-term growth trajectory remains solid and resilient. Its economy met its 5 per cent growth target last year, averaging 5.4 per cent during the 14th Five-Year Plan period, and accounted for around 30 per cent of global GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth.

  The Central authorities' focus is now on stimulating domestic demand as a key driver of sustained growth. As the middle-income population expands, so too does the appetite for high-quality goods and services. It has made clear that foreign products and services are welcome. And in fact, China has been organising the China International Import Expo since 2018. This is creating considerable opportunities for international businesses.

  Second, China is placing strategic emphasis on technological advancement. In the recommendations for the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan, science and technological self-reliance are at the forefront of national development. China's growing capabilities in AI, robotics and biotechnology have already captured global attention - and this momentum will only accelerate. With a strong focus on integrating technological and industrial innovation, China is determined to lead in critical technologies that will define the future global economy.

  Together, with a growing Southeast Asia, this part of the world is becoming as a vital source of growth, innovation, as well as business and investment opportunities.

Hong Kong's value proposition

  This naturally brings us to Hong Kong. What is our role in this evolving landscape? And what is our value proposition?

  We believe Hong Kong's significance will only grow. Hong Kong is very much the gateway for the world to access China's and Asia's opportunities, and vice versa. We have convenient and often priority access to the Mainland market, while maintaining all the characteristics that define us as an international metropolitan city: the common law system; an independent judiciary; free flow of capital, goods, people and information; a low and simple tax system; a currency pegged to the US dollar; and more. As a free port, Hong Kong remains steadfastly committed to free trade and supportive of a rules-based multilateral trading system.

  In a world where economies are reconfiguring value chains and seeking more resilient, diversified partnerships, Hong Kong stands out as a reliable, trusted, resourceful and well-positioned partner, bridging the Mainland and the world.

  In the realms of finance, allow me to highlight two key specific areas that may be of interest to you.

Two-way funding platform

  First, our role as the premier two-way international fundraising platform. Our stock market had a strong performance in the past two years, and in fact topped the IPO (initial public offering) league table last year. It continues to attract significant international interest, with more than 400 companies currently in the IPO pipeline. Many of them are Mainland enterprises engaged in frontier technologies and advanced manufacturing. These companies are choosing Hong Kong to fund and support their global expansion and supply chain diversification. A notable example is CATL, which launched the world's then largest IPO in Hong Kong last year to fund its expansion into Hungary.

  In other words, Hong Kong serves as a gateway for global investors to access China's innovation-driven opportunities.

  At the same time, we are working to bring more global companies to the Hong Kong market. For those exploring listing venues beyond the US (United States), Hong Kong offers a compelling choice. Our secondary market is deep, liquid and international. Statistics show that approximately 50 per cent of capital in our stock market comes from global institutional investors, 25 per cent from Mainland Southbound flows, and another 25 per cent from local institutional and retail investors. That is to say, by listing in Hong Kong, companies can gain access to both international and Mainland capital. 

  Hong Kong is indeed emerging as a listing hub for companies from across the globe. To drive this forward, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has since 2023 expanded its list of recognised exchanges for dual primary or secondary listings - now covering 20 markets, including those in the Middle East and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). In fact, recently, issuers from Thailand, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Singapore, and the UAE (United Arab Emirates), have chosen Hong Kong as their platform to access global capital.

  We are also strengthening connectivity with other markets through mutual listing of ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that invest in each other's market, providing investors with more choices. For example, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia each have listed two ETFs tracking each other's markets. We are also working with Korea on similar arrangements.

Offshore RMB business hub

  The second area is our position as the world's leading offshore Renminbi (RMB) business hub. This is particularly relevant today, as the use of RMB continues to grow globally - driven by two key forces.

  First, the reconfiguration of global supply chains. As more Chinese enterprises expand overseas and deepen co-operation with international partners, the cross-border use of the RMB is naturally increasing.

  Second, the growing demand for diversification. RMB assets tend to have a lower correlation with traditional global markets, making them an appealing option for investors seeking to manage risk.

  Besides, China currently accounts for around 13 per cent of global trade, but the RMB currently represents just 3 to 4 per cent of global payments via SWIFT. The potential for further expansion is significant, especially at a time when the US dollar is being weaponised.

  Hong Kong is expanding its offerings in RMB-denominated investment and risk management products, strengthening the related infrastructure, and enhancing its market liquidity. These efforts are creating more investment channels for international holders of the currency, and supporting the prudent internationlisation of the RMB.

Concluding remarks

  Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by reflecting on Hong Kong's enduring role in a rapidly changing world.

  Hong Kong has always thrived as an open, transparent and outward-looking financial and commercial hub. We believe that prosperity is built not by erecting barriers, but by building bridges - bridges that connect capital with innovation, East with West, and ideas with impact.

  At a time of global fragmentation, Hong Kong will continue to remain open for business, welcome partners from around the world to join us in shaping the future of Asia - and the world at large.

  Thank you very much."
​運輸及物流局局長出席「慶祝高鐵直達站點再創新里程」儀式致辭（只有中文）,2026-01-26 16:05,2026-01-26 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600514.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（一月二十六日）出席「慶祝高鐵直達站點再創新里程」儀式的致辭全文：

Jeny行政總裁（港鐵公司行政總裁楊美珍）、各位議員、各位嘉賓、各位傳媒朋友、各位香港市民：

很高興應港鐵公司邀請出席今日的活動，和大家一起見證高鐵西九龍站接駁內地高鐵網絡的直達站點再次突破，正如剛才Jeny所說，會增至110個。Jeny早前跟我預告即將突破100個站點，殊不知來到這個盛會，港鐵已經再為我們帶來好消息──不只100，而是110。我們熱切期待好消息陸續有來。

這不單象徵着公共交通運輸的新里程碑，更印證和體現香港和內地的密切聯繫。大家都知道香港有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，而西九龍站接駁內地龐大的高鐵網絡，帶領香港市民和遊客到內地走遍大江南北，正正體現香港作為「超級聯繫人」的角色。

接下來，我們要更加努力。正如剛才司儀和Jeny提到，西九龍站開通後服務一直不斷改善，除了直達站點有所增加，如果大家在趕車時有留意周邊的配套設施，在入閘處、零售餐飲處甚至是底層候車處，都進行了很多硬件和軟件上的提升，充分體現以人為本、貼心、便民的安排。

在此我再次感謝國鐵集團（中國國家鐵路集團有限公司）、廣鐵集團（中國鐵路廣州局集團有限公司）和港鐵公司，三方大力將西九龍站接駁內地的高鐵服務精益求精，不斷推出多元化的旅遊路線，亦在較近的站點提供「靈活行」的產品。

除了我上星期出席「粵車南下」活動時提到的港珠澳大橋外，高鐵香港段亦同樣已開通七年，在往來人次方面，已經雙雙累計超過一億。在這個「雙破億」的里程碑下，我們會進一步優化服務，為大家帶來更多不同的旅遊產品和出行方便。除了剛才提到的更多站點，亦會多一些動臥列車，而沿線站點亦更多元化，除了一些比較近、有美食的地方，還有文化古都等旅遊城市。和大家分享一個小秘密，我和團隊經常都會乘坐高鐵到內地訪問和開會，包括即日或隔日往返；若工餘時間有機會，我都很希望和朋友、家人乘坐高鐵，享受這些較便利的旅遊產品。今日雖然沒有機會和首發團一起出發，但我期望下次有機會和大家一同感受這些富有「獲得感」的旅遊產品。

說到精益求精，我們銳意與港鐵公司和其他香港企業，聯同內地、深圳和有關當局，努力構建「軌道上的大灣區」。我們正如火如荼地籌備和興建兩條跨境鐵路──北環線支線和港深西部鐵路（洪水橋至前海）。除了硬體的推進，我們亦期望盡快公布新的鐵路標準。這套新鐵路標準正正可以融合和利用國家在興建高鐵時所累積的經驗，以及所達到的領先建造水平，將這套領先的鐵路標準應用於香港。我們的願景是為大灣區和國家興建鐵路時，構建和打造一套與時並進的新標準，務求做到提速、提效和減低成本。

最後，希望港鐵公司高鐵網路服務於未來新一年的乘客量節節上升。我知道高鐵團隊的同事雖然辛苦，但戰意高昂，團隊精神很好，會為我們在新一年做到「快馬加鞭迎丙午，馬力全開接萬客」。多謝大家。"

財經事務及庫務局局長於第十九屆亞洲金融論壇會見傳媒談話內容,2026-01-26 15:31,2026-01-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600467.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（一月二十六日）上午出席第十九屆亞洲金融論壇期間會見傳媒的談話內容：

財經事務及庫務局局長：各位早晨。今日最令人振奮的一定是我們財經事務及庫務局與上海黃金交易所簽訂合作協議，強強聯手一起促進香港與上海作為國際金融中心及黃金市場的協同發展。這個也是香港建設國際黃金交易中心的重要一步。

我們與上海黃金交易所的合作主要有兩方面：一是建立高層次協作治理架構。我們已經成立了由特區（香港特別行政區）政府全資擁有的「香港貴金屬中央結算系統有限公司」，簡稱「港金結算公司」。「港金結算公司」將由我擔任董事會主席，上海黃金交易所代表出任副主席。上海黃金交易所代表將具體參與香港黃金中央清算系統準備、規則制定和機構認可等事宜，就系統建設及風險管理等提供專業意見。滬港將攜手推動結算平台高效建設，並與國際接軌。

第二方面的合作是開拓實物基礎設施協同，以及市場互聯互通新路徑。我們會和上海黃金交易所一起探索依託它們的實物倉儲管理體系，為香港本地及國際市場參與者提供實金存儲服務，也會積極推進兩地黃金市場更大程度的互聯互通，目標是構建真正一體化、高效開放的黃金生態圈。

建設可持續的黃金價值鏈，正如我剛才發言所提及，是包含多個元素——倉儲、精煉、交易、交割、清算，以及相關金融產品。今日我們也宣布了好幾項相關的新措施：

（一） 機場管理局已立項擴展在機場的倉儲設施，規模將達至千噸級別，兼顧本地儲存、交割和過境轉運需求。
（二） 去年底，我們與深圳市地方金融管理局就港深兩地開展加工貿易合作簽署了合作備忘錄，我們歡迎香港金商與深圳具備相關資格的精煉企業開展實質合作。
（三） 剛才提到的香港黃金中央清算系統計劃今年內便會試營運。
（四） 政府計劃今年上半年提交立法建議，把貴金屬納入有關基金及單一家族辦公室的優惠稅制合資格投資範圍。
（五） 成功的黃金生態圈發展一定要有巿場參與。我很高興，本星期，香港會有新的黃金基金上市。這個黃金基金最大的特色是透過本地的黃金基礎設施，進行所有實金交易及黃金儲存，亦會提供在銀行兌換實物黃金的選項。發行人還計劃推出非上巿類別，探索透過持牌數字資產交易平台分銷，連接傳統與數碼金融。
（六） 今日下午的黃金專題環節上，市場機構將公布香港可持續黃金治理框架和標準體系建設展望，務求推動合乎道德及可持續的採購、環境保護及長期責任標準。

今屆論壇另一個很值得期待的是明日舉行的全球產業峰會。亞洲金融論壇每年都在一年伊始的時候，匯聚世界各地的政府、金融和商界領袖與我們就金融發展與前景作深度討論，共同發掘新機遇。我們不單只講，更着重將其化為具體成果。所以環球投資項目對接（Deal-making）就是論壇的特色。今屆，我們更進一步地去推進金融賦能產業，明日我們首度舉辦全球產業峰會，參與的既有「走出去」的內地企業，亦有「引進來」的國際企業，峰會還會就多個近年火熱的高增長產業作討論，包括生物醫學、新能源、人工智能、機械人、高增長消費品等。

大家都看到今日會場內是人頭湧湧的，來自60多個國家的3 600多位參加者都來了，反映他們對香港的前景充滿興趣和信心。同樣對香港有長遠信心的還有遷冊來港的跨國企業。公司遷冊制度去年五月生效，市場反應十分正面。至今，我們收到超過三十宗申請。

而正正在今早，「安盛（AXA）中國有限公司」及其全資附屬公司「安盛保險（百慕達）有限公司」已正式獲公司註冊處簽發遷冊證明書，成功落戶本港，令過去八個月內累積獲批的申請增加至合共十四宗。未來，我們會繼續與公司註冊處及相關金融監管機構緊密合作，為有意遷冊來港的企業提供全面支援，吸引更多跨國企業落戶香港。

接下來，我會回答各位的提問。

記者：局長，剛剛你提到那個貴金屬交易所，尤其是黃金有儲存交割的這個。我想問一下內地的投資者怎麼可以參與？有沒有考慮去放開這個門檻給他們？

財經事務及庫務局局長：現在我們的計劃是先把香港的清算系統建立起來。正如剛才所說的，這個清算系統有兩個特點，第一，我們跟上海黃金交易所深度合作，包括董事會內，有我也有他們作為成員。

第二，我們會在實體交割，也就是倉儲這一方面，跟上海黃金交易所深度合作。下一步，當然我們也希望通過整個建設黃金生態圈的過程，能夠進一步在互聯互通有所突破。但目前為止，我們聚焦的就是黃金中央清算系統，並做好我們跟上海黃金交易所的具體合作。

記者：現在的黃金清算系統將如何與本地的黃金交易所合作？未來會否在黃金代幣化上有所嘗試？下一個問題是關於IPO（首次公開招股）的。近期市場有傳言說內地將會收緊企業來香港進行IPO，會增加限制。你覺得會否影響內地企業來香港上市這個趨勢呢？

財經事務及庫務局局長：剛才我也介紹了，我們在黃金這個領域，今天我們宣布的主要就是關於我們已經成立公司，由特區政府全資擁有，將建立黃金中央清算系統，同時跟上海黃金交易所深度合作，包括董事會的組成，也包括在倉儲服務體系方面的合作。

第二，我們在這過程內，當然也歡迎本地的、海外的黃金（市場）參與者來參與這個系統。具體上，我們現在就是在一些規則，還有政策上，會在董事會會議上定下來。具體下一個工作就是吸納各方面合資格的參與商，參與我們這個黃金市場。

第二個問題，香港目前為止，今年第一個月還未結束，我們已經迎來大概11隻新股上市，再加上350多隻正在排隊的企業（新股）來香港上市，熱情還是相當高。一直以來，我們也跟內地監管機構緊密溝通，確保香港能夠持續作為一個內地區域的，還有全球企業融資的最佳平台。

記者：結算公司（「香港貴金屬中央結算系統有限公司」）set up後會由你出任主席，那其他board members是誰？今年預計試行後，下一步計劃是怎樣？你們會怎樣吸引國際參與者參與clearing服務？

財經事務及庫務局局長：由政府全資擁有的「港金結算公司」，董事會包括我和上海黃金交易所的代表，其他代表基本上是主要銀行的代表，因為現時銀行是全球黃金市場交易和結算的主要參與者。參與的不單有本地銀行，海內外銀行亦在內，所以你看到國際性在我們整個黃金市場的構造和價值鏈方面是相當重要的，這是第一。

第二方面，你剛才問未來我們有甚麼工作要做，其實你看我們這次的整體安排，在全球大變局下，政府的信用是越來越重要的。在「一國兩制」下，國家的支持給予我們很充分的信心去把我們的黃金市場連結起來。下一步，有了結算公司後，我們在產品方面會有更多的推出，例如剛才我所說的港交所（香港交易所）黃金期貨，也包括剛才我所介紹的那個黃金基金。我們希望將整個價值鏈，由倉儲開始，包括結算和產品，都能夠豐富起來。

記者：現時跟深圳那邊一些合資格的企業在供應鏈方面的合作，會不會有一個時間表？例如上半年會在哪一個程度合作？下半年會到甚麼程度？還有粵港澳大灣區其他城市有沒有合作機會？甚至跟澳門那邊，未來會否也有機會探索這方面的合作呢？

財經事務及庫務局局長：雖然今早我們的合作協議是跟上海黃金交易所簽署，但即使是這樣，其實我們整個市場是有區域性，也有國際性的，我們希望例如大灣區（粵港澳大灣區）相關城市，在倉儲或在其他方面都能夠跟我們有所合作，又例如我們已經跟深圳市金融局（深圳市地方金融管理局）簽了協議，就是一些海外的或是香港的黃金精煉商，如果有興趣想用好深圳方面的精煉服務，可以通過香港依規合法地將黃金放進去，然後做精煉後拿出來，這些都是我們希望用好不單是跟上海合作，也包括在灣區的優勢，令我們這個黃金市場能夠結合起來。

記者：剛剛你提到跟國際間的金所有些合作，可否披露一下名字？有哪些在洽談當中？另外，人行副行長（中國人民銀行副行長鄒瀾）提到全力推進人民幣國債期貨，有沒有時間表？因為都提過數次。另外，遷冊方面目前收到超過三十宗申請，是哪一類型的公司？主要是哪些sector？

財經事務及庫務局局長：或許我先談遷冊，我們去年五月通過了法例和這套遷冊機制後，市場反應是很好的，包括主要好幾間的保險公司，也包括我剛才所說最新今早的AXA，我們亦看到很多金融機構其實都已經着手準備，甚至已經遷冊過來。

第二方面，不只是金融機構，我們也看到一些控股公司，或者其他經濟活動類型的公司，都在想這一方面的安排，甚至已經申請或獲批准，所以我剛才說有這個數量的（遷冊證明書）已經批出來。因此，你看到在大變局下，香港作為一個安全港，的確是能給予海外企業很十足的信心，將他們的業務搬過來。

國債期貨方面，一直以來，我們和內地證監會（中國證券監督管理委員會）或相關機構是有緊密溝通的。這些工作我們會繼續，有宣布時我們會盡快向市場交代。

環境及生態局局長在立法會環境事務委員會政策簡報會開場發言（只有中文）,2026-01-26 15:20,2026-01-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600485.htm,"以下是環境及生態局局長謝展寰今日（一月二十六日）在立法會環境事務委員會政策簡報會的開場發言：

主席、各位委員：

大家好。首先再次祝賀各位當選新一屆立法會議員。

環境及生態局轄下有兩個科，包括環境科及食物科，負責制定和統籌有關涵蓋氣候變化、環境保護、自然生態保育、綠色運輸、能源、改善環境衞生、保障食物安全、推進食物產業發展、促進漁農業可持續發展，以及推廣寵物友善等工作，相當廣闊。環境科的工作核心在於制訂與推行全面的環境保護政策，致力保護生物多樣性，實現碳中和目標，並推動香港成為綠色科技示範基地，使香港成為一個低碳綠色宜居的城市，邁向高質量和可持續發展。

今屆政府，我們的空氣質量不斷改善，是回歸後最好的；維港回復有多種珊瑚；維港沿岸水質和氣味大幅改善；我們設立了紅花嶺郊野公園；面積最大的北大嶼海岸公園；以及結合濕地保育、農耕作業與自然教育於一身的塱原自然生態公園，大鵬灣亦都獲選為全國美麗海灣的優秀案例。

我們扭轉了香港廢物棄置量長期上升的趨勢，廢物棄置量已經連續三年下降，回收率開始上升，第一個轉廢為能設施亦已開始投入運作。大家都關心的雙碳目標方面，香港的碳排放量持續下降，人均碳排放量只是美國的約四分之一；電動車數目三年來翻了兩翻，是二○二一年的四倍；一間電動車電池的回收設施也在建設中。為了抓住發展綠色能源的機遇，我們也制定了《香港氫能發展策略》。

放眼未來，二十屆四中全會通過的「十五五」規劃建議提出要加快經濟社會發展全面綠色轉型，建設美麗中國。綠色發展是中國式現代化的鮮明底色。要牢固樹立和踐行「綠水青山就是金山銀山」的理念，以碳達峰、碳中和為導引，協同推進降碳、減污、擴綠、增長，築牢生態安全屏障，增強綠色發展動能。

對接「十五五」規劃是我們未來的大方向和目標，這是我們的共同挑戰，但亦會帶來新機遇，邁步向前需要社會各界齊心協力。我們將繼續與各位委員共同為建設更美好的香港而努力。

接下來，我請署理常任秘書長（環境）郭慧玲女士用投影片向各位詳細報告環境科的工作、最新進展與未來重點。之後我們樂意和各位就環境科的工作交流意見。謝謝。"

Reporter: You have mentioned about keeping the communication with the Chinese Mainland IPOs. What concrete measures are being prioritised to ensure robust and sustained trading activity for new listings companies in Hong Kong, and how to make sure their quality?

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: I think one of the key things that we have tried to do is to ensure the continued quality of our own market. So you can see that in the coming year, there are a number of things that we will be pursuing.

First of all, in terms of the listing requirements, we will enhance our listing requirements to see how we can further our competitiveness in the capital market, in particular on the weighted voting rights, and the second one is on the secondary trading. We are also looking into how we can bring our clearing cycle from the current T+2 into T+1 with the market. At the same time, we are now reviewing our board lot size, and also the minimum spread of our stock market, with a view to enhancing the overall liquidity of our capital market.

This SEO targets construction sites of new works, focusing on work-at-height and high-risk work processes as well as machinery and plant (such as lifting equipment and power-operated elevating work platforms).

In view of the recent spate of serious work accidents at construction sites, the LD will immediately take stringent enforcement actions if any violations of the occupational safety and health (OSH) legislation are detected, including initiating prosecutions as well as issuing suspension notices and improvement notices.

To enhance enforcement efficiency, the LD also uses small unmanned aircraft to conduct aerial remote surveillance of construction sites. Upon detecting unsafe work practices, photos and videos will be taken immediately for evidence collection to support inspections and enforcement actions.

Under the general duty provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, employers are obligated to provide safe working environments, plant and systems of work for their employees. Those who contravene relevant provisions are liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

The LD reiterates that concerted efforts of employers and employees are essential for safeguarding the OSH of construction workers and building a safety culture. Apart from conducting the SEO, the LD will continue to adopt a multipronged strategy to foster an OSH culture and prevent accidents through regular inspections, publicity and promotion, education and training as well as the use of new technologies."

Honourable Director Zhou Ji of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Honourable Deputy Governor Zou Lan of People's Bank of China, Honourable Commissioner Cui Jiancun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Honourable Executive Vice Mayor Wu Wei of Shanghai, Honourable Vice Governor Wang Junshou of Hunan, Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), government officials and distinguished guests from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. And welcome to Hong Kong and the 19th Asian Financial Forum.

  I would first like to welcome our friends coming from around the world. I extend my warmest welcome to His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Klemen Bostjancic of Slovenia (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Slovenia), His Excellency Minister Mehmet Simsek from Türkiye (Minister of Treasury and Finance of Türkiye), as well as other officials and representatives of different countries. I also welcome Her Excellency Zou Jiayi, who has recently assumed the post of President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for joining us here. Thank you all.

  It is a great pleasure to be with you today - and so many of you, I'm delighted to see. Over these next two days, more than 3 600 are expected - high-profile finance and business leaders, visionary investors and entrepreneurs, senior policymakers, academics, economists and many other respected decision-makers, from more than 60 countries and regions.

  The inaugural Global Business Summit is among the many highlights of this year's Forum. Designed to encourage deeper financial and industrial co-operation, it will be held throughout tomorrow, day two of the AFF.

  Both days, with their panel discussions, plenaries, thematic workshops, fireside chats and other sessions, are organised under the tagline ""Finance Empowering Business"" and overall theme, ""Co-creating New Horizons amid an Evolving Landscape"". Featuring more than 150 prominent speakers, from Hong Kong, throughout the Asian region and around the world, the Forum will inspire insight and innovation, create partnerships and explore fresh business opportunities.

  I can't think of a better way to ring in this New Year, with its daunting issues and, yes, its boundless opportunities.

  Speaking of ""boundless opportunities"", allow me a few minutes to update you on Hong Kong, what we're doing and what we're planning to realise our far-reaching financial and business promise.

  It begins with ""one country, two systems"", the unique principle that assures us of the unwavering support of China, our country, while continuing to expand our global markets and reach. This unparalleled positioning solidifies our institutional strengths: the rule of law, a judiciary that exercises its power independently, an open and transparent market, the free flow of capital and a low and simple tax regime.

  These have ensured Hong Kong thrives as a top destination for enterprises that seek to grow and develop, in an environment that's safe and convenient to do business. You don't just have to take my word for it.

  Ladies and gentlemen, as we welcome the New Year, I am pleased to announce to you all, a truly international audience, that Hong Kong has made unprecedented achievements in the past year - in attracting quality businesses to our city.

  According to our annual survey, the number of foreign- and Mainland-affiliated companies in Hong Kong was 11 070 in 2025, up 11 per cent from the year before. That's a record high number of firms with their parent companies located outside Hong Kong.

  We've seen a robust growth of companies coming from a wide range of places. For example, those from Singapore, France, Australia, the United States and Switzerland have all risen by over 11 per cent. Companies from countries in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the Middle East have also grown by some 10 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, Mainland Chinese companies here have grown a whopping 17 per cent. Together, these enterprises from around the world hired nearly 510 000 people - more than half a million - in Hong Kong, up 3 per cent from 2024.

  We do more than bring in companies - we're also good at nurturing them. Last year, the number of start-ups in Hong Kong grew to over 5 200, again a record-breaking high, and up 11 per cent from 2024. Our start-ups hired nearly 20 000 people in Hong Kong; that's a 12 per cent growth year on year. And like our companies, our non-local entrepreneurs come from a large variety of places, with half of them coming mainly from the UK, the US, France and different Asian countries, and the other half from the Mainland.

  The encouraging results represent more than a vote of confidence in Hong Kong by these businesses and entrepreneurs. They also mean our solid efforts in facilitating business establishment and operation, and in creating an enabling ecosystem for start-ups, are bearing fruit.

  As you would know, companies turn to Hong Kong for many reasons - but our prowess as a financial hub is certainly a key factor.Hong Kong's financial regulatory system is robust, and our financial market stands out for its deep liquidity, innovative products and world-class investor protection. We also boast a highly educated workforce, a welcoming environment for global talent and transparent financial regulations aligned with international standards.

  These strengths are widely recognised. We ranked third, globally, and first in Asia, in the most recent Global Financial Centres Index. And we placed third in the 2025 World Competitiveness Yearbook, up two places over the previous year.

  Over the past year, we introduced a series of measures to enhance Hong Kong's listing mechanism and stock market. The results are clearly encouraging: the Hang Seng Index surged about 30 per cent last year, while average daily turnover rose to over US$32 billion.

  And Hong Kong ranked No.1 in the world last year in initial public offerings, raising some US$36 billion.

  Hong Kong has long been recognised as a hub for asset owners and family offices. At the end of 2024, we managed more than US$4.5 trillion in assets, 11 times our GDP - a year-on-year growth of 13 per cent.

  More than 200 family offices had set up operations or expanded their business here by the end of 2025.And we are working to welcome at least 220 more family offices to establish operations or expand their business in Hong Kong by 2028.

  As the world's largest offshore Renminbi business hub, Hong Kong processes about three quarters of global offshore Renminbi payments and has the largest offshore Renminbi liquidity pool.

  Last year, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority introduced a Renminbi Trade Finance Liquidity Facility. It was upgraded, last October, into a Renminbi Business Facility, allowing banks to expand the use of Renminbi by their corporate customers.

  The launch, also last year, of offshore Renminbi repurchase and cross-boundary repurchase businesses has boosted Renminbi liquidity channels. These arrangements provide investors with greater convenience, and more stable support, in obtaining liquidity and accessing the onshore repurchase business.

  In international bond issuance by Asian institutions, the volume arranged by Hong Kong in 2024 totalled more than US$130 billion, accounting for about 30 per cent of the market.

  Hong Kong has an active dim sum bond market as well, with issuance volume breaking the RMB1 trillion mark in 2024 and expected to reach a similar level in 2025.

  Hong Kong is also a leading green and sustainable finance hub. In 2024, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to about US$43 billion, capturing 45 per cent of the regional total and topping the Asian market for seven consecutive years.

  To date, we have issued government green bonds totalling US$32 billion, including retail, institutional and tokenised bonds of multiple currencies and tenors, raising funds for many local green projects.

  As of last September, we had issued over 200 ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds, with assets under management of more than US$141 billion. The number of ESG funds and assets under management increased 32 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, from three years ago.

  To boost our status as an international financial centre, we are focused on three main areas.

  First, we are working to reinforce Hong Kong's strengths. That includes deepening our equity market, expanding our bond market and advancing the asset management and wealth management sector.

  To boost our stock market, we introduced the Technology Enterprises Channel. It helps Mainland and international technology companies raise funds in Hong Kong.

  To elevate our status as one of the world's leading fundraising and investment hubs, we will optimise the Main Board's regimes for listing and issuing products.

  The HKEX (Hong KongExchanges and Clearing Limited) is working to enable electronic securities holding and trading and will put forward a proposal, in the coming months, to shorten the settlement cycle for Hong Kong's cash equities market. That, ladies and gentlemen, will create a solid foundation for the sustained growth of our capital markets.

  Rising global investor interest in Renminbi-denominated bonds highlights Hong Kong's pivotal role as a gateway for cross-boundary capital flow. And we will continue to explore measures that deepen mutual access between Mainland and Hong Kong financial markets. That includes introducing offshore treasury bond futures in Hong Kong and expanding interest rate derivatives under Swap Connect.

  Second, we are expediting the development of new growth areas. That very much includes building an international gold trading market and commodities trading ecosystem in Hong Kong.

  In a moment, you'll witness a bright illustration of our gold ambitions - the signing of a co-operation agreement between the Shanghai Gold Exchange and the HKSAR Government. The co-operation agreement will set in motion a cross-boundary, trade-clearing system for the precious metal.

  The HKSAR Government is also committed to expanding Hong Kong's gold storage, targeting a storing capacity of more than 2 000 tonnes in three years. That, ladies and gentlemen, will see Hong Kong's rise as a regional gold reserve hub.

  A central clearing system for gold will be established here, to provide efficient and reliable clearing services for gold transactions, in compliance with international standards.

  We will also diversify gold investment and work with the trade to form an industry organisation in Hong Kong.

  In commodities trading, we joined the London Metal Exchange's global warehousing network last January.

  To date, 15 Hong Kong warehouses have begun operations, with more than 20 000 tonnes of metals on warrant to support the Exchange's contract delivery.

  Turning to fintech, last June, we issued a second policy statement on digital assets, reinforcing the Government's commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for digital asset innovation.

  And last August, our Stablecoins Ordinance came into effect, providing a licensing regime for issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins in Hong Kong.

  Last month, we published the consultation conclusions on proposed licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers. We plan to introduce a bill into the legislature later this year.

  Last November, we expanded the products and services that can be offered by licensed, virtual asset trading platforms, and we will also promote artificial intelligence business applications.

  In the carbon market, the HKEX signed an MOU last year with the Guangzhou Emissions Exchange, the Shenzhen Green Exchange and the Macao International Carbon Emission Exchange, pledging to accelerate the Greater Bay Area's carbon markets and green finance development.

  Because there's so much more that Hong Kong, a leading financial hub, could do to promote sustainability in the capital market. That, I'm glad to add, has been recognised by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which confirmed, last June, that Hong Kong is one of the first jurisdictions to have set a target for fully adopting the Sustainability Disclosure Standards of the International Financial Reporting Standards.

  Third, international exchanges and co-operation remain a priority. We will assist companies interested in re-domiciling to Hong Kong, a world city that makes it much easier to connect with the globe and excel. Our company re-domiciliation regime, in effect since last May, has been positively received.

  To date, 14 non-Hong Kong corporations have re-domiciled to Hong Kong.

  And we are working on measures to attract more Mainland enterprises to establish Corporate Treasury Centres here.

  Ladies and gentlemen, that's just a taste of what we're doing to boost Hong Kong's status as an international business and financial centre, while ensuring a safe and stable environment for companies and investors.

  I am grateful to the organisers of the Asian Financial Forum, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the Government's Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, for once again bringing us together for finance and business - and, I trust, the many pleasures that Hong Kong, Asia's world city, offers.

  In just over three weeks, we will celebrate the Lunar New Year - the Year of the Horse.

  The horse symbolises vitality, perseverance and progress, qualities I'm sure we all look forward to realising, despite the hurdles and obstacles we face in today's non-stop geopolitical steeplechase.

  Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a rewarding Asian Financial Forum, and a healthy and prosperous Year of the Horse.

  Thank you."
Speech by CE at Asian Financial Forum (English only) (with video),2026-01-26 11:25,2026-01-26 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600277.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Asian Financial Forum (AFF) today (January 26):

Honourable Director Zhou Ji of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Honourable Deputy Governor Zou Lan of People's Bank of China, Honourable Commissioner Cui Jiancun of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Honourable Executive Vice Mayor Wu Wei of Shanghai, Honourable Vice Governor Wang Junshou of Hunan, Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), government officials and distinguished guests from around the world, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. And welcome to Hong Kong and the 19th Asian Financial Forum.

  I would first like to welcome our friends coming from around the world. I extend my warmest welcome to His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Klemen Bostjancic of Slovenia (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Slovenia), His Excellency Minister Mehmet Simsek from Türkiye (Minister of Treasury and Finance of Türkiye), as well as other officials and representatives of different countries. I also welcome Her Excellency Zou Jiayi, who has recently assumed the post of President of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, for joining us here. Thank you all.

  It is a great pleasure to be with you today - and so many of you, I'm delighted to see. Over these next two days, more than 3 600 are expected - high-profile finance and business leaders, visionary investors and entrepreneurs, senior policymakers, academics, economists and many other respected decision-makers, from more than 60 countries and regions.

  The inaugural Global Business Summit is among the many highlights of this year's Forum. Designed to encourage deeper financial and industrial co-operation, it will be held throughout tomorrow, day two of the AFF.

  Both days, with their panel discussions, plenaries, thematic workshops, fireside chats and other sessions, are organised under the tagline ""Finance Empowering Business"" and overall theme, ""Co-creating New Horizons amid an Evolving Landscape"". Featuring more than 150 prominent speakers, from Hong Kong, throughout the Asian region and around the world, the Forum will inspire insight and innovation, create partnerships and explore fresh business opportunities.

  I can't think of a better way to ring in this New Year, with its daunting issues and, yes, its boundless opportunities.

  Speaking of ""boundless opportunities"", allow me a few minutes to update you on Hong Kong, what we're doing and what we're planning to realise our far-reaching financial and business promise.

  It begins with ""one country, two systems"", the unique principle that assures us of the unwavering support of China, our country, while continuing to expand our global markets and reach. This unparalleled positioning solidifies our institutional strengths: the rule of law, a judiciary that exercises its power independently, an open and transparent market, the free flow of capital and a low and simple tax regime.

  These have ensured Hong Kong thrives as a top destination for enterprises that seek to grow and develop, in an environment that's safe and convenient to do business. You don't just have to take my word for it.

  Ladies and gentlemen, as we welcome the New Year, I am pleased to announce to you all, a truly international audience, that Hong Kong has made unprecedented achievements in the past year - in attracting quality businesses to our city.

  According to our annual survey, the number of foreign- and Mainland-affiliated companies in Hong Kong was 11 070 in 2025, up 11 per cent from the year before. That's a record high number of firms with their parent companies located outside Hong Kong.

  We've seen a robust growth of companies coming from a wide range of places. For example, those from Singapore, France, Australia, the United States and Switzerland have all risen by over 11 per cent. Companies from countries in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the Middle East have also grown by some 10 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, Mainland Chinese companies here have grown a whopping 17 per cent.

Remarks by SFST at agreement signing ceremony with Shanghai Gold Exchange (English only)(with photo),2026-01-26 10:52,2026-01-26 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600219.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the agreement signing ceremony with the Shanghai Gold Exchange at the Asian Financial Forum today (January 26):

Deputy Governor Zou (Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr Zou Lan), Vice Mayor Wu Wei (Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei), Director Zhou (Executive Deputy Director of the Office of the Financial Commission of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Mr Zhou Xiaoquan), Chairman Yu (Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Mr Yu Wenjian), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great privilege to address you today at the Asian Financial Forum. As we convene in Hong Kong, the world's leading international financial centre, we just now witnessed a defining milestone in the development of our gold market as highlighted by the previous two keynote speeches, with my bureau and the Shanghai Gold Exchange signing a landmark co-operation agreement.

Gold has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Its unique physical attributes, inherent scarcity, and proven safe-haven function make it irreplaceable in areas such as national reserves, asset allocation and diversification. In recent years, amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and ongoing restructuring of the international monetary system, the strategic importance of gold has become even more pronounced. Against this backdrop, deepening co-operation between Hong Kong and Shanghai in the gold sector carries profound significance.

The agreement just now signed is far more than a formal document. It represents a resolute commitment to advancing the synergistic development of Hong Kong and Shanghai as premier international financial and gold markets. It reflects our joint determination to deepen the integration and complementary strengths of Hong Kong and Shanghai, so that together we can expand our share and influence in the global gold market, and better support Renminbi (RMB) internationalisation. Guided by the principles of mutual learning, win-win co-operation, interconnectivity, mutual recognition and shared development, we will leverage the distinctive advantages of both markets to enhance transaction and delivery efficiency, and elevate our voice in international gold pricing and governance.

Two elements of this agreement stand out as particularly significant and forward-looking. First, we are establishing a high-level, collaborative governance structure for Hong Kong's new gold central clearing system. The Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited - wholly owned by the Government - will have its Board chaired by myself, while a representative from the Shanghai Gold Exchange will serve as Deputy Chairman. In that capacity, representative of the Shanghai Gold Exchange will actively participate in the Board, contributing to the preparation of the gold central clearing system, the formulation of rules, the admission of participating institutions, and the provision of expert advice on system design, risk management and other areas.

Second, we are opening exciting new avenues for physical infrastructure synergy and market interconnectivity. Our two sides will explore leveraging the Shanghai Gold Exchange's well-established physical warehousing management regime to provide secure gold management services for participants in both the Hong Kong and international markets. Building on this foundation, we aim to drive greater connectivity between on-exchange and off-exchange gold trading activities. Through the central clearing system and key participants in the emerging Hong Kong gold trading ecosystem, we will explore practical measures to deliver greater business convenience and technical alignment, enabling investors from both sides to participate more seamlessly and cost effectively in each of our own markets. These initiatives will create a truly integrated, efficient and open ecosystem that serves participants across both markets.

This co-operation agreement sits within a broader, holistic vision for Hong Kong's gold market ecosystem - one that we are developing with determination and strategic coherence, where every measure is purposefully designed to build trust among global participants and promote innovation in products, infrastructure, and practices.

We are actively supporting the Airport Authority Hong Kong and financial institutions to establish advanced gold storage facilities - building trust through secure and scalable custody solutions, while promoting innovation in logistics and physical flows. The target is to exceed 2 000 tonnes of storage capacity within three years, making Hong Kong a trusted global vault. The Airport Authority has already launched a project to expand warehousing to a thousand-tonne scale, catering to local storage, delivery and also transit requirements.

We have also strengthened regional linkages through a Memorandum of Understanding signed between my bureau and our Shenzhen counterpart - building trust via clear policy guidance, and promoting innovation in GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) supply chain integration - which provides solid support for Hong Kong gold traders to co-operate with qualified Shenzhen refining enterprises in processing trade, unlocking new value in the supply chain.

On trading and clearing, Hong Kong's government-led central clearing system for gold is on track to begin trial operations this year - building trust through enhanced transparency, robust risk mitigation, and a reliable settlement mechanism in line with global best practices, while promoting innovation in efficient market operation.

For the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single family offices, the Government will propose including precious metals as qualifying investments. The target is to introduce the legislative proposal in the first half of this year.

We are also expanding the range of investment options - building trust with reliable, accessible vehicles backed by physical assets, and promoting innovation at the intersection of traditional and digital finance. This week, a new gold fund will list in Hong Kong. Its key features include leveraging Hong Kong's well-established gold infrastructure for physical gold trading and storage, with the option of physical gold redemption at bank. Also, the issuer plans to explore an unlisted share class for potential distribution through licensed digital asset exchanges.

Furthermore, at a gold-themed session later today at this forum, market participants will release an outlook on the development of Hong Kong's sustainable gold governance framework and standards, with a view to fostering sustainable sourcing, environmental protection, and long-term responsibility standards.

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, the signing of an agreement with the Shanghai Gold Exchange marks the dawn of a new chapter - one in which Hong Kong and Shanghai join forces to shape the future of global gold markets. Let us embrace this historic opportunity to build stronger bridges, ignite innovation and create enduring value for investors and economies alike. Thank you."

Second, we are opening exciting new avenues for physical infrastructure synergy and market interconnectivity. Our two sides will explore leveraging the Shanghai Gold Exchange's well-established physical warehousing management regime to provide secure gold management services for participants in both the Hong Kong and international markets. Building on this foundation, we aim to drive greater connectivity between on-exchange and off-exchange gold trading activities. Through the central clearing system and key participants in the emerging Hong Kong gold trading ecosystem, we will explore practical measures to deliver greater business convenience and technical alignment, enabling investors from both sides to participate more seamlessly and cost effectively in each of our own markets. These initiatives will create a truly integrated, efficient and open ecosystem that serves participants across both markets.

This co-operation agreement sits within a broader, holistic vision for Hong Kong's gold market ecosystem - one that we are developing with determination and strategic coherence, where every measure is purposefully designed to build trust among global participants and promote innovation in products, infrastructure, and practices.

We are actively supporting the Airport Authority Hong Kong and financial institutions to establish advanced gold storage facilities - building trust through secure and scalable custody solutions, while promoting innovation in logistics and physical flows. The target is to exceed 2 000 tonnes of storage capacity within three years, making Hong Kong a trusted global vault. The Airport Authority has already launched a project to expand warehousing to a thousand-tonne scale, catering to local storage, delivery and also transit requirements.

We have also strengthened regional linkages through a Memorandum of Understanding signed between my bureau and our Shenzhen counterpart - building trust via clear policy guidance, and promoting innovation in GBA (Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area) supply chain integration - which provides solid support for Hong Kong gold traders to co-operate with qualified Shenzhen refining enterprises in processing trade, unlocking new value in the supply chain.

On trading and clearing, Hong Kong's government-led central clearing system for gold is on track to begin trial operations this year - building trust through enhanced transparency, robust risk mitigation, and a reliable settlement mechanism in line with global best practices, while promoting innovation in efficient market operation.

For the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single family offices, the Government will propose including precious metals as qualifying investments. The target is to introduce the legislative proposal in the first half of this year.

We are also expanding the range of investment options - building trust with reliable, accessible vehicles backed by physical assets, and promoting innovation at the intersection of traditional and digital finance. This week, a new gold fund will list in Hong Kong. Its key features include leveraging Hong Kong's well-established gold infrastructure for physical gold trading and storage, with the option of physical gold redemption at bank. Also, the issuer plans to explore an unlisted share class for potential distribution through licensed digital asset exchanges.

Furthermore, at a gold-themed session later today at this forum, market participants will release an outlook on the development of Hong Kong's sustainable gold governance framework and standards, with a view to fostering sustainable sourcing, environmental protection, and long-term responsibility standards.

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, the signing of an agreement with the Shanghai Gold Exchange marks the dawn of a new chapter - one in which Hong Kong and Shanghai join forces to shape the future of global gold markets. Let us embrace this historic opportunity to build stronger bridges, ignite innovation and create enduring value for investors and economies alike. Thank you."
"金管局人民幣業務資金安排總額度倍增至2,000億元人民幣",2026-01-26 10:45,2026-01-26 11:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600247.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（一月二十六日）宣布，其人民幣業務資金安排的總額度將由目前的1,000億元人民幣增加至2,000億元人民幣，新額度將於二月二日起生效。

在中國人民銀行（人民銀行）的大力支持下，金管局借助與人民銀行的貨幣互換安排，在二○二五年十月推出人民幣業務資金安排，升級替代同年二月出台的人民幣貿易融資流動資金安排。這項新舉措為銀行提供穩定、成本較低的人民幣資金，讓銀行有更充裕的資金向企業客戶提供人民幣融資，支持在實體經濟中更廣泛地使用人民幣。這項安排有序地將在岸人民幣引入離岸市場，經香港輻射到世界其他地區，進一步強化香港作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的獨特優勢和地位。

自升級安排推出以來，銀行業界反應踴躍，1,000億元人民幣的總額度已全數分配給40家參與銀行。在新安排下，融資對象從參與銀行的企業客戶伸延至其集團的境外銀行機構的企業客戶，資金用途亦從貿易融資擴展至資本支出和營運資金定期貸款。實施以來，額度使用量持續增長，有個別參與銀行的額度使用已經達到或接近上限。安排除了服務香港的企業，更成功將離岸人民幣資金輻射到東盟、中東和歐洲等地。此外，亦有其他銀行一直積極表達參與該安排的意願。

人民幣業務資金安排總額度倍增至2,000億元人民幣後，已參與銀行可按業務需求申請增加額度，而其他有興趣參與的銀行亦可向金管局提出申請，金管局將按既定準則批出新的額度。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「我們衷心感謝人民銀行的大力支持，令人民幣業務資金安排得以不斷升級擴容。安排的總額度增至2,000億元人民幣，令金管局可以配合市場的發展需要，適時提供充足的人民幣流動性，協助銀行拓展人民幣業務，支持實體經濟健康發展，同時進一步鞏固提升香港國際金融中心和離岸人民幣業務樞紐的地位。我們會不時審視落實情況，包括各參與銀行的額度使用程度，聽取市場的反饋意見，按實際需要持續優化。我們亦歡迎人民銀行支持香港人民幣清算行通過發行同業存單等不同方式從境內市場獲取不同期限的流動性，這有利於香港清算行提高服務能力，也對離岸市場的流動性供應帶來正面作用。」

​人民幣業務資金安排的額度申請指引、條款及操作細節請見金管局網站。"
HKMA RMB Business Facility doubles to RMB200 billion in size,2026-01-26 10:45,2026-01-26 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600250.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

​The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (January 26) that the total size of the RMB Business Facility (RBF) will increase from the current RMB100 billion to RMB200 billion, with effect from February 2.

With the strong support of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA leveraged the currency swap arrangement with the PBoC to launch the RBF in October 2025, which replaced and enhanced the RMB Trade Financing Liquidity Facility introduced in February 2025. The RBF provides banks with a stable and relatively lower-cost source of Renminbi (RMB) funds, enabling them to offer RMB financing to their corporate clients and support the wider use of RMB in the real economy. The facility channels onshore RMB liquidity into offshore markets in an orderly manner, by adopting a ""hub-and-spoke"" model with Hong Kong as the hub, further enhancing Hong Kong's unique advantages and role as the global offshore RMB business hub.

​The RBF has received overwhelming response from the banking sector since its launch, with the RMB100 billion aggregate quota fully allocated to 40 participating banks. With the implementation of the RBF, eligible end-users have extended from corporate clients of Hong Kong banks to cover also corporate clients of the participating banks' overseas intragroup banking entities. Eligible activities have also been expanded from trade finance to cover capital expenditure and working capital term loans. With the increasing usage of the facility, some participating banks have reached or are approaching the cap of their quotas. The experience so far suggests that the RBF has not only served corporates in Hong Kong but has also successfully channelled offshore RMB funds to regions such as the ASEAN countries, the Middle East, and Europe. Meanwhile, more banks have indicated keen interest in participating in the RBF.

​The doubling of the RBF to RMB200 billion provides space to raise quota allocated to participating banks and to onboard more banks. The HKMA welcomes existing and aspiring banks to submit applications and will consider the allocation of quotas in accordance with established practice.

​Mr Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the HKMA, said, ""We are grateful to the PBoC for its strong support, which has enabled the continued upgrading and expansion of the RBF. The increase of the facility size to RMB200 billion enables the HKMA to provide timely and sufficient RMB liquidity to meet market development needs, assist banks to enhance their RMB business, support the healthy development of the real economy, and further reinforce Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and global offshore RMB business hub. We will continue to monitor the implementation of the RBF, including quota utilisation by participating banks, collect market feedback, and enhance the RBF as appropriate. We also welcome PBoC's support for the Hong Kong RMB Clearing Bank to issue negotiable certificates of deposit onshore, thereby expanding its access to liquidity across various maturities. This will strengthen the Clearing Bank's service capabilities and contribute positively to offshore RMB liquidity condition.""

The guidance to RBF quota application, terms and conditions, as well as operation procedures can be found on the HKMA website."

The FSTB also revealed new moves in six aspects relating to the development of gold market at the same time.

The agreement was signed by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (SFST), Mr Christopher Hui, and the Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Mr Yu Wenjian, in the presence of the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee; the Deputy Governor of the People's Bank of China, Mr Zou Lan; Member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shanghai Municipal Committee and Executive Vice Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, Mr Wu Wei; and the Executive Deputy Director of the Office of the Financial Commission of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, Mr Zhou Xiaoquan.

Mr Hui also outlined the strategic significance of the agreement and the overall development blueprint for Hong Kong's gold market at the signing ceremony. He said, ""Gold has long been regarded as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Its unique physical attributes, inherent scarcity, and proven safe-haven function make it irreplaceable in areas such as national reserves, asset allocation and diversification. In recent years, amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and ongoing restructuring of the international monetary system, the strategic importance of gold has become even more pronounced. The agreement signed by the FSTB and Shanghai Gold Exchange represents a resolute commitment to translating the spirit of the Central Financial Work Conference, advancing quality financial opening into concrete action while fostering synergistic development of Hong Kong and Shanghai as premier international financial and gold markets.""

This significant agreement covers two major forward-looking areas of co-operation:

1. Establishing a high-level, collaborative governance structure for Hong Kong's new gold central clearing system. The Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited, which is wholly owned by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, will have its Board chaired by the SFST while a representative from the Shanghai Gold Exchange will serve as Deputy Chairman. The representative of the Shanghai Gold Exchange will actively participate in the Board, contributing to the preparation of the system, the formulation of rules, the admission of participating institutions, and the provision of expert advice on system design, risk management and other areas.

The two sides will explore leveraging the Shanghai Gold Exchange's well-established physical warehousing management regime to provide secure gold management services for participants in both Hong Kong and international markets. The two sides aim to drive greater connectivity between on-exchange and off-exchange gold trading activities. The two sides will forge ahead broader mutual market access by exploring the provision of business convenience and technical alignment to investors from two places through the Hong Kong Precious Metals Central Clearing Company Limited and key participants in the emerging Hong Kong gold trading ecosystem, thereby creating a truly integrated, efficient and open ecosystem.

Mr Hui further elaborated on the Government's vision and supporting measures for Hong Kong's gold market development. They are:

2. The FSTB has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau, laying the foundation for processing trade co-operation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The next step is to welcome Hong Kong gold traders to engage in substantive co-operation with qualified Shenzhen refining enterprises.

3. Hong Kong's government-owned central clearing system for gold is on track to begin trial operations this year.

4. For the preferential tax regimes offered to funds and single family offices, the Government will propose including precious metals as qualifying investments. The target is to introduce the legislative proposal in the first half of this year.

Together with record numbers of Mainland and overseas companies and start-ups in the city, there are a clear reflection of the strong global investor confidence in Hong Kong. Our city's unique advantages, such as enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle, proactively integrating into the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and capitalising on national strategies such as the high-quality co-operation under the Belt and Road Initiative, continue to make it an important hub for businesses and investments, attracting enterprises across the globe to select the city as their base to expand regional businesses in Asia. This year marks the commencement of the 15th Five-Year Plan; the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to create an even more conducive business environment, further promote Hong Kong's national opportunities and international advantages to attract FDI and companies to Hong Kong, demonstrating the city's roles as a 'super-connector' and a 'super value-adder'.""

駐港公司和初創企業數目再創新高反映香港無可比擬優勢,2026-01-26 09:26,2026-01-26 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600137.htm,"政府今日（一月二十六日）公布的「二零二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司按年統計調查」和「二零二五年初創企業統計調查」結果顯示，在二○二五年，母公司在內地及海外的駐港公司數目增加至11 070間，而香港的初創企業數目則增至5 221間。兩項數字均再創新高，顯示香港對全球企業的獨特吸引力持續增加，是它們設立或擴展業務的理想投資目的地。

商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺表示：「即使面對地緣政治和環球經貿格局的轉變，香港一直積極發揮在『一國兩制』下無可比擬的獨特優勢，是海外企業開拓內地龐大市場和內地企業出海的最佳雙向跳板。加上政府推出一系列促進經濟的政策措施，包括成立內地企業出海專班、制定優惠政策包吸引高增值產業落戶、加速發展北部都會區、開設駐吉隆坡經濟貿易辦事處等，將繼續增強香港的優勢，加速為經濟注入新動力，為駐港海內外企業帶來更多機遇。」

他續說：「另一方面，香港的初創企業數目持續錄得雙位數字的百分比增長，足證香港是初創企業落戶的理想地點和環球初創企業家對香港的強大信心。初創企業可善用香港的優勢，包括匯聚國際一流的大學及科研機構、具創業精神的人才、來自全球的投資者、以及本地強大的孵化器及加速器網絡等，快速發展創科業務，一展所長。」

上述的本地調查結果充分證明海內外企業對香港前景充滿信心，而香港近期亦在多份國際機構報告中名列前茅，包括再次獲菲沙研究所評定為全球最自由經濟體，以及在聯合國貿易和發展發布的《2025年世界投資報告》中，於外來直接投資流入方面總體排名上升至第三位，印證香港作為世界公認的國際商業和投資樞紐。

根據投資推廣署及政府統計處共同進行的「二零二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司按年統計調查」，二○二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司數目達11 070間，較二○二四年增加1 110間，上升11%；而僱用人數高達509 000人，按年上升3%。

按母公司所在地分析，在二○二五年，內地駐港公司數目最多（3 090間），其次是美國和日本（均為1 550間）、英國（770間）及新加坡（590間）。

該11 070間駐港公司中，按在香港的主要業務範圍分析，在二○二五年從事進出口貿易、批發及零售業的駐港公司數目最多（5 100間），其次是金融及銀行業（2 390間），以及專業、商用及教育服務業（1 770間）。

此外，投資推廣署進行的「二零二五年初創企業統計調查」結果顯示，香港的初創企業持續蓬勃發展，二○二五年的數目按年增加11%至5 221間，再創歷史新高，共僱用19 753人，按年增加12%。這些初創企業涵蓋不同行業，包括金融科技；資訊、電腦及科技；生物科技；教育及學習；以及健康及醫療等。

Record high numbers of companies and start-ups affirm Hong Kong's incomparable business advantages,2026-01-26 09:26,2026-01-26 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600135.htm," According to the results of the 2025 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong and the 2025 Startup Survey announced by the Government today (January 26), the number of companies in Hong Kong with Chinese Mainland or overseas parent companies rose to 11 070 in 2025, while the number of start-ups in Hong Kong increased to 5 221, both reaching record highs again. The results demonstrate that Hong Kong's unique attractiveness to enterprises from around the globe continues to rise, and that the city is the ideal investment destination to set up or expand businesses.

 The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said, ""Even though geopolitics and the global economic and trade landscape are evolving, Hong Kong has been proactively demonstrating its incomparably unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle, as the best two-way springboard for overseas enterprises to tap into the vast Chinese Mainland market and for Chinese Mainland enterprises to go global. Together with the wide array of the latest initiatives to promote economic development, including the establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global, the formulation of preferential policy packages to attract high value-added industries to Hong Kong, the accelerated development of the Northern Metropolis, the establishment of the Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, etc, Hong Kong's advantages will continue to strengthen, thereby accelerating the injection of new impetus to our economy and providing more opportunities for both Chinese Mainland and overseas companies based in Hong Kong.

 ""On another note, the number of start-ups in Hong Kong continues to grow at a double-digit percentage rate, signifying that the city is an ideal place for start-ups to thrive, and demonstrating the great confidence that global start-up entrepreneurs have in Hong Kong. Start-ups can leverage the strengths of Hong Kong - including its concentration of internationally renowned universities and research institutes, entrepreneurial talent, and investors from around the world, as well as a strong local network of incubators and accelerators, to rapidly develop innovation and technology businesses that showcase their strengths,"" Mr Yau added.

 The results of the above two local surveys fully display the confidence of Chinese Mainland and overseas companies in Hong Kong's future development. Also, Hong Kong recently received exceptional rankings in reports by various international institutes. For example, Hong Kong was again ranked by the Fraser Institute as the world's freest economy, and moved up to third place overall in foreign direct investment inflows in the World Investment Report 2025 released by the United Nations Trade and Development. Such recognition demonstrates the world's growing awareness of Hong Kong as an international hub for business and investment.

 According to the 2025 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong jointly conducted by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) and the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), there were 11 070 companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside Hong Kong in 2025, representing an increase of 11 per cent, which amounted to 1 110 companies, when compared with 2024. The number of people employed reached 509 000, recording an increase of 3 per cent year on year.

 Analysed by the location of parent company, in 2025, the Chinese Mainland was ranked first (3 090), followed by the United States and Japan (both 1 550), the United Kingdom (770) and Singapore (590).

 Analysed by major line of business in Hong Kong, among those 11 070 companies, in 2025, the import/export trade, wholesale and retail sector topped the list (5 100), followed by the financing and banking sector (2 390), and the professional, business and education services sector (1 770).

 In addition, based on the results of InvestHK's 2025 Startup Survey, start-ups in Hong Kong continued to flourish with a record high number of 5 221, up 11 per cent year on year. These start-ups engaged 19 753 persons, representing an increase of 12 per cent year on year, spanned across different sectors, including financial technology; information, computer and technology; biotechnology; education and learning; and health and medical, etc.

 The results of the two surveys have been uploaded onto the websites of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110004&scode=360) and InvestHK (www.investhk.gov.hk/en/resource-centre/?type=brochures-and-guides-general) respectively."

最新監測數據
——————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-25 17:30,2026-01-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/25/P2026012500485.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 25), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.
