Government fully committed to minimising impact of Super Typhoon Ragasa on Hong Kong (with photos),2025-09-24 23:45,2025-09-25 00:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092401544.htm,"âSuper Typhoon Ragasa brought hurricane-force winds to many parts of Hong Kong, causing flooding in coastal and low-lying areas due to overtopping waves and storm surges. The steering committee on handling extreme weather, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Chan Kwok-ki, with thorough preparation and comprehensive planning, swiftly co-ordinated with various relevant government departments to minimise the impact of the typhoon on the public. As Ragasa gradually moved away from Hong Kong later this morning, various government departments, while prioritising safety, promptly initiated comprehensive recovery efforts to restore normalcy as quickly as possible.

Mr Chan visited this afternoon (September 24) a site in the Central and Western District affected by fallen trees and a landslide to inspect the clean-up and recovery progress by departments such as the Fire Services Department (FSD), the Highways Department (HyD), and the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO). He then chaired a meeting of the steering committee on handling extreme weather to receive updates from the heads of relevant bureaux and departments and comprehensively review emergency response and recovery efforts of various government departments.

Government departments are mobilising all necessary manpower and resources to expedite clearing obstacles from major roads and bus routes. According to current clean-up assessments by relevant departments, major roads and public transport are expected to reopen when the Hong Kong Observatory issues the Strong Wind Signal No. 3, allowing the city to resume normalcy.

The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre under the Security Bureau was fully activated more than 24 hours before the Hong Kong Observatory issued the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal, ensuring the best priorities for emergency decision-making, striving to minimise the impact of the adverse weather on the public.

The Development Bureau (DEVB) is maintaining close liaison with various works departments and the Buildings Department (BD) to deploy resources of contractors to expedite the progress of the recovery work.

*Regarding flooding, 19 flooding cases have been confirmed as of 5pm today. With the efforts of the Drainage Services Department (DSD)'s emergency response teams and the assistance of the mobile powerful pumping robots, 14 cases have been resolved. The DSD is currently addressing the remaining five flooding cases and is confident of resolving them within one to two hours. The DSD conducted analysis and made deployment in advance before the onset of the super typhoon and was equipped with mobile powerful pumping robots on standby, contributing to the swift handling of possible flooding cases during the passage of the super typhoon in Hong Kong. Once all flooding cases have been resolved, the DSD will conduct inspections and carry out clearance at about 240 flood-prone locations. Additionally, the DSD will examine the drainage conditions of 80 major rivers and drainage channels to ensure their smooth operation.

*Regarding the safety of structures, the Emergency Control Centre of the BD has received a total of 25 emergency reports related to signboards and scaffoldings at construction sites, 22 of which have been resolved. The BD proactively inspected construction sites next to major roads in advance to reduce incidents caused by the super typhoon as much as possible. After the typhoon, the BD has also launched special patrols to identify potential dangers arising from loosened or damaged signboards, scaffoldings, windows and appendages along major roads and in high-risk buildings in various districts.

*Regarding landslides, as of 5pm, the GEO received a total of four reports of landslides in Sai Ying Pun, Tuen Mun, Stanley and Chung Pui. Two incidents involved slope and retaining wall failures caused by fallen trees. The GEO has arranged for geotechnical engineers to assist relevant departments for follow-up work. The Emergency Control Centre of the GEO will remain in operation to handle reports of landslide incidents received until the threat is lifted.

*Regarding fallen trees, various relevant departments will expedite the handling of them. To enhance efficiency, the DEVB earlier identified some 50 plots of government land in various districts for the departments' temporary storage of fallen trees and debris in nearby areas before sending them to landfills for disposal. After the passage of the typhoon, tree management departments will inspect trees in areas with high pedestrian and vehicular flow and take appropriate measures, including stabilising trees, removing dangling broken branches, and removing fallen or unstable trees. In case of blockage of rural roads caused by fallen trees, members of the public may seek assistance through the 1823 Mobile App, by calling 1823 or sending an email to tellme@1823.gov.hk. Cases will be referred to relevant departments for follow-up as appropriate

In addition, after typhoons and rainstorms, trees, slopes and the structures may also be affected due to a large intake of water into soil and surface layers. Members of the public should therefore remain vigilant when going outdoors and avoid prolonged stays under trees, slopes and structures with signs of concrete spalling.

The FSD, by 5pm today, handled a total of 143 reports of people trapped in lifts, 454 reports from automatic fire alarm systems, 393 reports of fallen trees and two reports of landslides. Assistance was provided to 61 people to safe places in 16 flooding incidents. The FSD has co-ordinated with various departments, including the HyD and the Transport Department (TD), for rapid clearing of fallen trees blocking major roads, ensuring the smooth flow of main roads and rescue routes remain unobstructed. Relevant work will be carried out overnight.

The Emergency Transport Coordination Centre (ETCC) of the TD has escalated its operational level and has been operating round the clock throughout the typhoon. It closely monitored traffic and transport conditions on major routes, including trunk roads, tunnels and bridges across the territory. The ETCC expedited assessment of the typhoon's impact on traffic with relevant departments and public transport operators, and steered operators to conduct site checks along their routes to ensure safe operations before gradually resuming normal services, such as railway and franchised buses. In addition, the TD conducted ongoing review of situations at various trunk roads and link roads at locations without alternative routes. This helped the prompt identification of locations affected by flooding or obstructed by objects requiring higher priority of clearance and co-ordination of clearance work of departments concerned, with a view to reopening blocked roads and fully resuming public transport services early.

The Emergency Control Centres of the HyD were activated on the morning of September 22. Officers of the HyD, together with road maintenance contractors, have been closely monitoring the latest conditions of major public roads in real time and responding promptly to emergencies caused by the inclement weather. As of 5pm, the department received approximately 1 620 reports of road incidents, including around 1 050 cases of fallen trees, around 85 cases of flooding and six reports of landslides. The department commenced patrolling major roads at 1.20pm, and the work has already been completed. Nearly 200 emergency response teams under the department also stand ready for deployment. The teams have been mobilised to remove fallen trees and obstructions on roads, to clear debris-clogged roadside drains and channels, as well as to carry out emergency cordoning-off and urgent repair works for collapsed slopes under safe conditions. The HyD will continue to make every effort to clear the remaining fallen trees and other road obstructions to restore normal traffic as soon as possible after the typhoon. In addition, the 16 pedestrian subways along Shing Mun River in Sha Tin, Lam Tsuen River and Tai Po River in Tai Po, which were temporarily closed last night due to inclement weather and storm surge, have been reopened starting from 5pm.

In view of the possible threats that Ragasa may pose to Hong Kong, the Home Affairs Department (HAD) and District Offices (DOs) had initiated relevant response measures in advance. They have co-ordinated with relevant departments and organisations to enhance preparedness, setting up sandbags and water-stop boards, among others. District Council (DC) members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams were mobilised to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to make necessary preparations. Residents in flood-prone areas were advised to stay away from their homes or stay at temporary shelters. All DOs opened temporary shelters in advance at 8am yesterday. During the tropical cyclone, a total of 50 temporary shelters were in operation with a total of about 900 residents, which is more than before. In addition, the HAD also activated a round-the-clock hotline in advance at noon on September 22 for public enquiries on the tropical cyclone and released information on the operation of temporary shelters through different channels continuously. The HAD's Emergency Co-ordination Centre began operation in the afternoon on the same day to co-ordinate work and information dissemination in 18 districts as well as promptly follow up on various incident reports.

After the typhoon, DOs will continue to co-ordinate support from other departments and organisations, and mobilise DC members, members of ""the three committees"", and Care Teams to provide appropriate assistance. This includes helping affected households, particularly households of singleton and doubleton elderly persons affected by severe flooding, remove stagnant water and restore their homes. As the weather in Hong Kong remains unstable, the temporary shelters under the HAD will continue to open during the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 to serve citizens in need until the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 is cancelled. In addition, DOs will co-ordinate with relevant departments and organisations to carry out relief work in their districts, enabling the community to resume normalcy as soon as possible to facilitate citizens' commuting to work or school.

To support government departments and the waste transfer sector in rapidly handling fallen trees and waste to restore normalcy as quickly as possible, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has been maintaining close communication with the industry during the past few days and implemented multiple measures. These include reserving sufficient temporary storage areas at the three landfills and Y·PARK for collecting and storing fallen tree waste, as well as preparing emergency sawing and wood-chipping equipment to facilitate rapid clean-up. Recyclable tree waste will be sorted out and sent to Y·PARK for recycling and reuse. Additionally, the EPD has allocated in advance manpower and machinery to ensure sufficient capacity at refuse transfer stations (RTS) and extended the operating hours of urban RTSs and the three landfills from today to September 26. Recovery works are now in full swing at the Island East Transfer Station which was affected by storm surge during the typhoon, with a view to resuming service at the soonest practicable time. The EPD will keep a close tab on the operation of waste handling facilities and flexibly redeploy resources to facilitate a swift return to normalcy.

In advance of the typhoon's approach, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has conducted inspections and cleaning of roadside gullies at flooding blackspots to minimise the risk of blockage caused by refuse and fallen leaves. The FEHD has also secured or removed some facilities such as litter containers placed in open areas, and has reminded operators of on-street hawker stalls to implement appropriate typhoon precautionary measures. Following the passage of the typhoon, the FEHD will resume street cleaning and refuse collection services as soon as possible, including deploying departmental and contractor cleaning staff to expedite the removal of refuse from major thoroughfares.

After the wind subsided, staff members of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) immediately inspected country parks for damage to facilities, fallen trees and road blockages. The AFCD also cleared fallen trees and arranged for repairs of damaged facilities to expedite the reopening of affected facilities for public use. As weather conditions remain unstable, there are still risks of flash floods, flooding, tree falls, and landslides in rural areas. The AFCD urges members of the public to refrain from outdoor activities.

During the typhoon, frontline police officers remained steadfast in carrying out their duties, taking appropriate actions based on the situation. These included urging the public to stay away from shorelines and flood-prone areas, deploying personnel to handle high-risk areas such as unstable scaffolding and precarious windows, and evacuating residents from affected areas. Officers also closely monitored traffic conditions and eased the traffic by assisting vehicles trapped by flooding or blocked by fallen trees and other obstacles. Fallen trees and other debris on roads were promptly cleared to reopen blocked roads as soon as possible.

The Housing Department (HD) Communication Centre was activated before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 was hoisted to get fully prepared in handling emergencies. During the passage of the tropical cyclone, frontline staff of the HD remained dedicated to delivering their duties and took all necessary precautionary measures. In addition, the emergency response team of the HD's construction sites stepped up vigilance and maintained close contact and collaboration with relevant government departments to promptly respond to possible emergency situations during the typhoon. They also worked with project teams and contractors to clear debris from nearby drainage outlets to effectively reduce the accumulation of muddy water on the roads in the vicinity and swiftly remove the water barriers misplaced by the strong wind to minimise traffic disruption.

The steering committee on handling extreme weather reminds the public that although the storm gradually moved away, the weather in Hong Kong remains unstable, and the public should continue to stay updated with the latest government announcements. The committee emphasises that staff from various government departments will continue to fulfil their duties, working together with various sectors to fully engage in community recovery efforts and provide appropriate support to those in need. Departmental personnel will continue to carry out relief work with contractors, enabling members of the public to resume a normal life as soon as possible."

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-09-24 20:21,2025-09-24 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092401155.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (September 24) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees.

政府上下全力減低超強颱風樺加沙對本港影響,2025-09-24 18:50,2025-09-24 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092401187.htm,"超強颱風樺加沙為本港多處帶來颶風，越堤浪及風暴潮亦導致沿岸及低窪地區出現水浸。由政務司司長陳國基領導的應對極端天氣督導委員會在充分準備及全方位部署下，迅速統籌協調各相關政府部門，全力減低樺加沙對市民的影響。隨着樺加沙在今天早上較後時間開始逐漸遠離香港，在確保安全的前提下，各政府部門已經提早迅速開展全方位的善後工作，以期讓市面盡快復常。

陳國基今日（九月二十四日）下午到中西區一個塌樹及山泥傾瀉現場，實地視察情況，了解消防處、路政署及土力工程處等部門的清理善後進度。其後，陳國基主持應對極端天氣督導委員會會議，聽取相關局長和部門首長的最新匯報，全面檢視各政府部門最新的應急及善後工作進展。

各政府部門正投入一切所需人力和物力，加快處理主幹道及主要巴士路線的障礙物。根據目前各相關部門就不同善後工作的評估，各主要道路及公共交通預計可以在天文台改發三號強風信號時恢復通行，讓市面基本復常。

保安局轄下的緊急事故監察及支援中心於天文台發出八號烈風或暴風訊號逾24小時前已全面投入運作，確保應急決策優次獲得最佳保障，全力減低惡劣天氣對市民的影響。

發展局正與各工務部門及屋宇署保持緊密聯繫，調配承建商資源，以協助加快復常工程的進度。

＊處理水浸方面，截至今日下午五時，共有19宗確認水浸個案。經渠務署緊急應變隊伍的努力，以及強力排水機械人的協助下，已完成處理其中14宗水浸個案。現時正處理五宗水浸個案，渠務署有信心可以在一至兩小時處理妥當。渠務署在超強颱風侵襲前已預先進行分析及部署，再配合安排強力排水機械人戒備，以致可在超強颱風襲港時迅速處理可能出現的水浸個案。渠務署會於完成處理水浸個案後，巡查及清理全港約240個因渠道淤塞而容易水浸地點，以及檢查80條主要河道和渠道的排水情況，確保系統運作暢順。

＊構築物安全方面，屋宇署緊急事故控制中心共接獲25宗關於招牌及地盤棚架等緊急事故個案，至今已完成處理22宗個案。屋宇署在事前主動巡查主要街道旁的建築地盤，務求盡量減少超強颱風引致的事故個案。颱風過後，屋宇署亦已啓動特別街道巡查，以辨識各區主要街道旁及潛在風險較高樓宇的鬆脫或損毀的招牌、棚架、窗戶和構築物等。

＊山泥傾瀉方面，截至下午五時，土力工程處共接獲四宗山泥傾瀉報告，事故地點位於西營盤、屯門、赤柱和涌背，其中兩宗涉及塌樹引致斜坡和擋土牆損毀。土力工程處已安排土力工程師協助相關部門跟進事故。土力工程處的緊急控制中心會繼續運作，處理接獲的山泥傾瀉事故報告，直至威脅解除為止。

＊有關塌樹方面，各相關部門會加快處理倒塌的樹木，為了加快處理效率，發展局早前已經物色了50多幅分佈各區的政府土地，供各部門得以在就近臨時擺放這些塌樹及雜物，稍後再安排送往堆填區。在颱風過後，樹木管理部門會巡查位於人流車流高地區的樹木，採取相應措施，包括穩固樹木、移除懸吊斷枝、移除倒塌或根基不穩的樹木。倘若市民發現有塌樹堵塞鄉郊道路，可致電尋求協助。請透過手機應用程式（Tell me@1823） 、致電1823或電郵至tellme@1823.gov.hk，以便相關部門作適當跟進。

此外，颱風及暴雨過後樹木、斜坡及構建物亦可能因為泥土及表層大量吸水而受影響，市民外出時需保持警覺，盡量避免在樹下、斜坡及出現石屎剝落現象的構築物下長時間逗留。

消防處截至今日下午五時，共處理了143宗有人被困升降機報告，454宗自動報火警系統報告，393宗樹木倒塌報告，一宗山泥傾瀉報告，以及九宗水浸事故報告，當中在16宗水浸事故中共協助了61名市民到安全地方。消防處已協調路政署、運輸署等部門，盡快清理阻塞主要路段的塌樹，優先保障主幹道暢通及確保救援路線不受阻礙，並會繼續通宵進行有關工作。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心在颱風襲港期間一直24小時運作並提升級別，密切監察全港各區主要幹道、隧道和橋樑等重要道路的交通及運輸情況。協調中心與相關部門及公共運輸服務營辦商加快評估颱風對交通造成的影響，督導營辦商做好沿線檢視，確保安全穩妥後陸續恢復鐵路、專營巴士等正常服務。此外，署方持續檢視各主要幹道及沒有替代路線地點的連接道路清單，務求快捷分辨出須優先清理水浸和路面障礙物的位置，協調相關部門執行清理工作，盡快開通阻塞道路及讓公交服務恢復營運。

路政署緊急控制中心於九月二十二日早上已啟動，路政署人員一直聯同道路維修保養承建商實時監察主要公共道路的最新情況，迅速應對惡劣天氣引發的突發情況。截至下午五時，路政署共收到約1620宗道路事故報告，包括約1050宗塌樹、約85宗水浸和六宗山泥傾瀉報告等，本署已於下午一時二十分開始巡查主要道路工作, 並已完成。路政署轄下近200隊應急隊伍亦隨時候命，在安全情況下出動清理道路上的塌樹、障礙物及淤塞的道路集水溝和渠道，以及為倒塌的斜坡進行緊急圍封及搶修工程等。路政署會繼續全力以赴，清理餘下的塌樹及其他路面障礙，令交通在風暴過後得以迅速恢復正常。此外，因應惡劣天氣及風暴潮而於昨晚臨時封閉的沙田城門河、大埔林村河及大埔河沿岸16條行人隧道則已於下午五時開始重新開放。

因應樺加沙可能為香港帶來的威脅，民政事務總署（民政總署）及各區民政事務處（民政處）已預早啓動相關應對工作，協調相關部門和機構加強防備，設置沙包和擋水板等，亦動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新的天氣資訊，提醒他們做好準備，以及勸喻居住水浸風險較高地區的居民及早遷離居所，或到臨時庇護中心暫避。各區民政處已提早於昨日上午八時開放臨時庇護中心，風暴期間一共開放50個臨時庇護中心，比以往開放的數目更多，期間共有約900人入住。另外，民政總署亦提前在九月二十二日中午設立了一條24小時緊急事故熱線供市民查詢熱帶氣旋消息，並持續透過不同途徑發布臨時庇護中心的運作資訊。民政總署緊急事故協調中心亦於同日下午運作，協調各區工作及傳遞信息，迅速跟進各項緊急事故報告。

在風暴過後，各區民政處會繼續協調其他部門和機構作出支援，並動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊提供適切協助，包括協助有需要的住戶，特別是受嚴重水浸影響的獨老和雙老住戶清理積水和復原受影響的家居。由於天氣仍然不穩定，民政處轄下的臨時庇護中心於三號強風信號下會繼續開放，供有需要市民入住，直至三號強風信號除下。另外，各區民政處會協調相關部門和機構於當區進行善後工作，以期讓市面盡快復常，利便市民出行、上班或上學。

環境保護署（環保署）為協助政府及業界於颱風後迅速處理塌樹及廢物以盡快復常，在過去數天一直與廢物運輸業界保持緊密溝通，並採取多項措施，包括在三個堆填區及Y·PARK [林．區]預留充足的臨時木料廢物收集區，接收及暫存塌樹廢物，並預早準備應急的鋸木及碎木機，以盡快協助清理塌樹廢物，當中可回收的樹木將被送往Y-PARK回收再造。另外，環保署在颱風襲港前已事先調配人手及機械，為廢物轉運站預留充足容量，並且在九月二十四至二十六日延長各市區廢物轉運站和三個堆填區的開放時間。在颱風期間受風暴潮影響的港島東廢物轉運站現正搶修中，將盡快重開。環保署並會繼續密切留意各廢物處理設施的運作情況並靈活調配資源，全力協助盡快復常。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）在颱風來臨前已提早巡查並清理容易出現水浸黑點的路邊集水溝渠，減少垃圾和樹葉導致溝渠淤塞的風險。食環署亦已加強固定或移走設於露天地方的廢屑箱等設施，並提醒街上小販排檔做好防風措施。颱風過後，食環署會盡快恢復街道潔淨服務及垃圾收集服務，包括調動署方及承辦商潔淨工作人員加快清理主要街道上的垃圾。

颱風過後，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）人員隨即到各郊野公園巡查，檢視設施損壞、樹木倒塌及道路阻塞的情況，並清理塌樹及安排維修損毀設施，以期盡快重新開放受影響設施供市民使用。鑑於天氣仍然不穩定，郊區仍有山洪暴發、水浸、塌樹和山泥傾瀉的風險，漁護署強烈勸諭市民取消所有戶外活動。

風暴期間，前線警務人員堅守崗位，因應情況採取適當行動，包括到場勸喻市民遠離海邊及水浸黑點、調配人手處理高風險位置，例如有機會倒塌的棚架及窗戶，以及協助受影響居民疏散。人員亦密切監察交通情況，協助受水浸或被倒樹及障礙物阻擋的車輛，疏導交通。路面上的倒樹及其他雜物被即時切割及清除，務求盡快重新開通阻塞道路。

房屋署聯絡中心於八號熱帶氣旋警告發出前已預先啓動，準備隨時處理突發事故。在熱帶氣旋襲港期間，房屋署前線同事緊守崗位，作出應對防範措施。此外，各施工地盤的緊急應變小組亦提高警覺，與相關政府部門保持緊密聯繫和協作，迅速應對颱風下可能出現的突發情況，並與工程團隊與承建商清理附近排水口雜物，有效減少泥水於附近路面積聚，以及迅速清理被強風吹至移位的水馬，避免影響附近交通及市民出行。

應對極端天氣督導委員會提醒市民，雖然風暴正遠離香港，但現時本港天氣仍然不穩定，大家應繼續留意政府發放的最新消息。委員會強調，政府各部門人員會繼續恪守職責，聯同社會各界全力進行社區復原工作，以及向有需要的市民提供適切支援。各部門人員及有關合約承建商會繼續推進善後工作，讓市民儘快回復正常生活。"

＊構築物安全方面，屋宇署緊急事故控制中心共接獲25宗關於招牌及地盤棚架等緊急事故個案，至今已完成處理22宗個案。屋宇署在事前主動巡查主要街道旁的建築地盤，務求盡量減少超強颱風引致的事故個案。颱風過後，屋宇署亦已啓動特別街道巡查，以辨識各區主要街道旁及潛在風險較高樓宇的鬆脫或損毀的招牌、棚架、窗戶和構築物等。

＊山泥傾瀉方面，截至下午五時，土力工程處共接獲四宗山泥傾瀉報告，事故地點位於西營盤、屯門、赤柱和涌背，其中兩宗涉及塌樹引致斜坡和擋土牆損毀。土力工程處已安排土力工程師協助相關部門跟進事故。土力工程處的緊急控制中心會繼續運作，處理接獲的山泥傾瀉事故報告，直至威脅解除為止。

＊有關塌樹方面，各相關部門會加快處理倒塌的樹木，為了加快處理效率，發展局早前已經物色了50多幅分布各區的政府土地，供各部門得以在就近臨時擺放這些塌樹及雜物，稍後再安排送往堆填區。在颱風過後，樹木管理部門會巡查位於人流車流高地區的樹木，採取相應措施，包括穩固樹木、移除懸吊斷枝、移除倒塌或根基不穩的樹木。倘若市民發現有塌樹堵塞鄉郊道路，可致電尋求協助。請透過1823流動應用程式、致電1823或電郵至tellme@1823.gov.hk，以便相關部門作適當跟進。

此外，颱風及暴雨過後樹木、斜坡及構建物亦可能因為泥土及表層大量吸水而受影響，市民外出時需保持警覺，盡量避免在樹下、斜坡及出現石屎剝落現象的構築物下長時間逗留。

消防處截至今日下午五時，共處理了143宗有人被困升降機報告，454宗自動報火警系統報告，393宗樹木倒塌報告，一宗山泥傾瀉報告，以及九宗水浸事故報告，當中在16宗水浸事故中共協助了61名市民到安全地方。消防處已協調路政署、運輸署等部門，盡快清理阻塞主要路段的塌樹，優先保障主幹道暢通及確保救援路線不受阻礙，並會繼續通宵進行有關工作。

運輸署緊急事故交通協調中心在颱風襲港期間一直24小時運作並提升級別，密切監察全港各區主要幹道、隧道和橋樑等重要道路的交通及運輸情況。協調中心與相關部門及公共運輸服務營辦商加快評估颱風對交通造成的影響，督導營辦商做好沿線檢視，確保安全穩妥後陸續恢復鐵路、專營巴士等正常服務。此外，署方持續檢視各主要幹道及沒有替代路線地點的連接道路清單，務求快捷分辨出須優先清理水浸和路面障礙物的位置，協調相關部門執行清理工作，盡快開通阻塞道路及讓公交服務恢復營運。

路政署緊急控制中心於九月二十二日早上已啓動，路政署人員一直聯同道路維修保養承建商實時監察主要公共道路的最新情況，迅速應對惡劣天氣引發的突發情況。截至下午五時，路政署共收到約1 620宗道路事故報告，包括約1 050宗塌樹、約85宗水浸和六宗山泥傾瀉報告等，本署已於下午一時二十分開始巡查主要道路工作, 並已完成。路政署轄下近200隊應急隊伍亦隨時候命，在安全情況下出動清理道路上的塌樹、障礙物及淤塞的道路集水溝和渠道，以及為倒塌的斜坡進行緊急圍封及搶修工程等。路政署會繼續全力以赴，清理餘下的塌樹及其他路面障礙，令交通在風暴過後得以迅速恢復正常。此外，因應惡劣天氣及風暴潮而於昨晚臨時封閉的沙田城門河、大埔林村河及大埔河沿岸16條行人隧道則已於下午五時開始重新開放。

因應樺加沙可能為香港帶來的威脅，民政事務總署（民政總署）及各區民政事務處（民政處）已預早啓動相關應對工作，協調相關部門和機構加強防備，設置沙包和擋水板等，亦動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊向區內易受水浸影響的居民發放最新的天氣資訊，提醒他們做好準備，以及勸喻居住水浸風險較高地區的居民及早遷離居所，或到臨時庇護中心暫避。各區民政處已提早於昨日上午八時開放臨時庇護中心，風暴期間一共開放50個臨時庇護中心，比以往開放的數目更多，其間共有約900人入住。另外，民政總署亦提前在九月二十二日中午設立了一條24小時緊急事故熱線供市民查詢熱帶氣旋消息，並持續透過不同途徑發布臨時庇護中心的運作資訊。民政總署緊急事故協調中心亦於同日下午運作，協調各區工作及傳遞信息，迅速跟進各項緊急事故報告。

在風暴過後，各區民政處會繼續協調其他部門和機構作出支援，並動員區議員、地區「三會」委員及關愛隊提供適切協助，包括協助有需要的住戶，特別是受嚴重水浸影響的獨老和雙老住戶清理積水和復原受影響的家居。由於天氣仍然不穩定，民政處轄下的臨時庇護中心於三號強風信號下會繼續開放，供有需要市民入住，直至三號強風信號除下。另外，各區民政處會協調相關部門和機構於當區進行善後工作，以期讓市面盡快復常，利便市民出行、上班或上學。

環境保護署（環保署）為協助政府及業界於颱風後迅速處理塌樹及廢物以盡快復常，在過去數天一直與廢物運輸業界保持緊密溝通，並採取多項措施，包括在三個堆填區及Y·PARK [林．區]預留充足的臨時木料廢物收集區，接收及暫存塌樹廢物，並預早準備應急的鋸木及碎木機，以盡快協助清理塌樹廢物，當中可回收的樹木將被送往Y-PARK回收再造。另外，環保署在颱風襲港前已事先調配人手及機械，為廢物轉運站預留充足容量，並且在九月二十四至二十六日延長各市區廢物轉運站和三個堆填區的開放時間。在颱風期間受風暴潮影響的港島東廢物轉運站現正搶修中，將盡快重開。環保署並會繼續密切留意各廢物處理設施的運作情況並靈活調配資源，全力協助盡快復常。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）在颱風來臨前已提早巡查並清理容易出現水浸黑點的路邊集水溝渠，減少垃圾和樹葉導致溝渠淤塞的風險。食環署亦已加強固定或移走設於露天地方的廢屑箱等設施，並提醒街上小販排檔做好防風措施。颱風過後，食環署會盡快恢復街道潔淨服務及垃圾收集服務，包括調動署方及承辦商潔淨工作人員加快清理主要街道上的垃圾。

颱風過後，漁農自然護理署（漁護署）人員隨即到各郊野公園巡查，檢視設施損壞、樹木倒塌及道路阻塞的情況，並清理塌樹及安排維修損毀設施，以期盡快重新開放受影響設施供市民使用。鑑於天氣仍然不穩定，郊區仍有山洪暴發、水浸、塌樹和山泥傾瀉的風險，漁護署強烈勸諭市民取消所有戶外活動。

風暴期間，前線警務人員堅守崗位，因應情況採取適當行動，包括到場勸喻市民遠離海邊及水浸黑點、調配人手處理高風險位置，例如有機會倒塌的棚架及窗戶，以及協助受影響居民疏散。人員亦密切監察交通情況，協助受水浸或被倒樹及障礙物阻擋的車輛，疏導交通。路面上的倒樹及其他雜物被即時切割及清除，務求盡快重新開通阻塞道路。

房屋署聯絡中心於八號熱帶氣旋警告發出前已預先啓動，準備隨時處理突發事故。在熱帶氣旋襲港期間，房屋署前線同事緊守崗位，作出應對防範措施。此外，各施工地盤的緊急應變小組亦提高警覺，與相關政府部門保持緊密聯繫和協作，迅速應對颱風下可能出現的突發情況，並與工程團隊與承建商清理附近排水口雜物，有效減少泥水於附近路面積聚，以及迅速清理被強風吹至移位的水馬，避免影響附近交通及市民出行。

應對極端天氣督導委員會提醒市民，雖然風暴正遠離香港，但現時本港天氣仍然不穩定，大家應繼續留意政府發放的最新消息。委員會強調，政府各部門人員會繼續恪守職責，聯同社會各界全力進行社區復原工作，以及向有需要的市民提供適切支援。各部門人員及有關合約承建商會繼續推進善後工作，讓市民盡快回復正常生活。"

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-24 17:30,2025-09-24 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400939.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 24), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 22 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 771 new CF cases in Guangdong in the past week (September 14 to 20), a significant increase compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 201 cases (September 7 to 13) and 178 cases (August 31 to September 6) respectively, in which 2 583 cases were recorded in Jiangmen. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

 
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-24 17:30,2025-09-24 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400923.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月二十四日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得22宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（九月十四日至九月二十日）廣東省新增2 771宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別201宗（九月七日至十三日）及178宗（八月三十一日至九月六日）顯著增加，當中2 583宗個案在江門市錄得。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。

自二○二五年初至八月，全球16個國家／地區呈報了約31萬7千宗基孔肯雅熱病例及135宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

財庫局局長在斯洛文尼亞財政部高級別會議上向歐洲財政部長展示香港優勢（附圖）,2025-09-24 11:40,2025-09-24 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400273.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇九月二十三日（盧布爾雅那時間）在斯洛文尼亞盧布爾雅那與歐洲各國財政部長及不同地區的金融專家一同出席高級別圓桌會議，並向他們展現香港集合中國與環球優勢於一城的無可比擬實力。他亦向斯洛文尼亞商界推介香港蓬勃的金融市場。

該高級別會議由斯洛文尼亞財政部主辦，以「釋放增長潛力：斯洛文尼亞和歐洲資本市場的未來」為題，匯聚克羅地亞、愛沙尼亞和斯洛文尼亞的財政部長、歐洲聯盟委員會金融服務和儲蓄與投資聯盟專員，以及眾多金融領袖和專家，分享真知灼見，共同推動歐洲資本市場邁向更美好的未來。

許正宇以講者身分參與了「環球資本市場的成功之道」專題討論環節。他表示，香港位處戰略性位置，是連接全球傳統市場和新興市場，契合雙方需求的首要門戶。除獲評為全球三大國際金融中心之一外，香港更受惠於中國內地實體經濟和熾熱的投資需求，成為注目的環球資金池。

他說：「單計今年首八個月，已有59家公司在港新上市，透過公開招股合共集資146億歐元，較去年同期增長579％。如果有留意南向交易流入香港的資金淨額，便會看到二○二五年首八個月的資金淨流入已接近1054億歐元，成交額相當於香港股票市場整體成交額的24.5％，超越以往的年度水平。香港有各種互聯互通項目，為包括歐洲在內的環球投資者提供多樣化的資產配置和風險管理選項，讓他們可抓緊內地經濟增長帶來的無限機遇。」

「香港經濟表現亮麗，行政長官剛在《施政報告》中宣布推出更多針對性措施去強化香港資本市場，開拓新的經濟成長點。這些措施包括吸引更多內地企業在香港設立企業財資中心，以及吸引更多銀行在香港設立地區總部；加快建設涵蓋倉儲、精煉、交易和清算的國際黃金交易市場；完善政策措施，例如進一步優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠稅制，以鞏固基金和家族辦公室行業的增長勢頭；以及促進金融科技、綠色和可持續金融的發展。」

會議期間，許正宇與克羅地亞財政部長Marko Primorac博士會談。他還出席了由斯洛文尼亞副總理兼財政部長Klemen Boštjančič舉辦的聯誼午宴，與其他講者深入交流。

下午，許正宇出席斯洛文尼亞最大商會－斯洛文尼亞工商協會（GZS）舉辦的商務活動。GZS旗下的斯洛文尼亞—中國商務委員會旨在加強兩國之間的合作與商貿關係，協助斯洛文尼亞企業進入中國市場。

許正宇表示，現在是善用香港優勢，借助香港這個理想平台進軍亞洲及中國市場的最佳時機。香港金融市場擁有世界知名的完善監管制度，為投資者提供最穩定、具可預見性且與國際慣例接軌的投資環境，而本港世界級的專業服務亦能支持企業走得更廣更遠。

GZS今年十一月初將率領商務代表團到訪香港和內地，至今已有逾50家公司報名參加。許正宇說，斯洛文尼亞的公司將可在到訪期間，親身了解香港和內地的龐大機遇，機會難得，期待它們屆時可以達成一些合作項目。

許正宇九月二十四日（盧布爾雅那時間）在與Boštjančič和政府官員會面後，會轉往波蘭華沙繼續訪問行程。"
SFST showcases Hong Kong's strengths to European ministers of finance at high-level conference organised by Ministry of Finance of Slovenia (with photos),2025-09-24 11:40,2025-09-24 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092400284.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, attended a high-level roundtable conference with European ministers of finance and financial experts from different regions in Ljubljana, Slovenia,on September 23 (Ljubljana time) and showcased Hong Kong's unparalleled strengths in converging its global advantage and its China advantage in one single city. He also promoted Hong Kong's vibrant financial markets to the Slovenian business community.

   The high-level conference themed ""Unlocking Growth: The Future of Slovenian and European Capital Markets"" was hosted by the Ministry of Finance of Slovenia, and gathered ministers of finance from Croatia, Estonia and Slovenia, theCommissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union of the European Commission, as well as many more financial leaders and experts to share insights in driving a more promising future for European capital markets.

  As one of the panellists at the panel discussion titled ""Global Practices in Capital Markets"", Mr Hui said that Hong Kong is strategically located as a premier gateway to connect traditional markets and emerging markets across the world, matching the needs of both sides. Aside from being one of the top three international financial centres in the world, Hong Kong enjoys the advantages brought by the real-world economy and keen investment demand in the Chinese Mainland, turning the city into an enticing pool for global investment.

  He said, ""Just for the first eight months this year, we had 59 companies newly listed in our stock market of 2025, raising a total of EUR14.6 billion through IPOs (initial public offerings) and marking an upsurge of 579 per cent when compared to the same period last year. If you look at the net fund inflows from the Chinese Mainland to Hong Kong, we are talking about a sum close to EUR105.4 billion for the first eight months of 2025. Its turnover is equivalent to 24.5 per cent of our market's overall turnover and surpassing the historical annual levels. In Hong Kong, we have introduced various mutual access programmes to provide diverse asset allocation and risk management options for investors from around the world including Europe in accessing the immense opportunities fuelled by economic growth on the Mainland.

  ""Amid this stellar performance, our Chief Executive just announced in his Policy Address that more targeted initiatives would be rolled out to strengthen our capital market and unlock new areas of economic growth. Measures include attracting more Mainland enterprises to set up corporate treasury centres and more banks to establish their regional headquarters in Hong Kong; expediting the building of an international gold-trading market covering storage, gold refining, trading and clearing; refining policy measures like further enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest to keep up the growth momentum of the fund and family office sector; as well as fostering development of fintech, and green and sustainable finance.""

  Mr Hui had a meeting with the Minister of Finance of Croatia, Dr Marko Primorac, on the sidelines of the conference. He also had some deeper exchanges with other panellists at the networking lunch hosted by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Slovenia, Mr Klemen BoštjanÄiÄ.

  In the afternoon, Mr Hui joined a business event organised by the Gospodarska zbornica Slovenije (GZS) which is the largest chamber of commerce and industry in Slovenia. The Slovenian-Chinese Business Council under the GZS aims to strengthen co-operation and business relations between the two countries and help Slovenian companies access the Mainland market.

  Mr Hui told the audience that there is no better time than now to capitalise on the advantages of Hong Kong as the perfect platform to enter the Asian and Chinese Mainland markets. With a world-renowned and robust regulatory regime, Hong Kong's financial markets offer the most stable and predictable environment that is aligned with international practices for investors. The world-class professional services available in Hong Kong can support enterprises to go far.

  The GZS will be leading a business delegation to visit Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland in early November this year, and so far over 50 companies have enrolled. Mr Hui said that it would definitely be a good occasion for Slovenian companies to see for themselves the vast opportunities in the region, and looked forward to future collaboration.

  On September 24 (Ljubljana time), Mr Hui will proceed to Warsaw, Poland, to continue his visit after having meetings with Mr BoštjanÄiÄ and Slovenia government officials."

Hospital Authority service arrangements announced,2025-09-24 06:30,2025-09-24 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092301036.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

A Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson announced that non-emergency services of public hospitals will be suspended today (September 24), including services of general out-patient clinics, specialist out-patient clinics, allied health clinics (such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, etc), geriatric day hospitals and psychiatric day hospitals, ambulatory services, non-emergent laboratory tests (such as blood tests and returning of specimens) and diagnostic services.

The HA spokesperson said, ""Non-urgent patients should avoid visiting public hospitals or clinics during storm or adverse weather conditions for the sake of safety. Public hospitals will resume all affected non-emergency services as soon as possible after the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is cancelled. Affected patients will be notified gradually in the coming week to reschedule their appointments. Patients do not need to be concerned. All clusters have also set up hotlines for patients' enquiries (see attached table).""

During the period when the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or above is in force, all acute services at public hospitals, including services of accident and emergency departments, inpatient services, and emergency surgeries, will remain as normal.

The HA Major Incident Control Centre will closely monitor the operations of all hospitals and maintain close communication with relevant government departments to ensure public hospital services remain unaffected during adverse weather conditions.
