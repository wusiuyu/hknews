Update on mosquito-borne diseases,2025-08-22 19:02,2025-08-22 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200717.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 22), no new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

There have been no new cases of CF in the past week in Hong Kong. So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of nine confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. All cases have recovered and been discharged without complications. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually. 

For dengue fever (DF), there have been no new cases in the past week in Hong Kong either. There have been 41 imported DF cases recorded so far this year.A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

For Japanese encephalitis (JE), Hong Kong has recorded one imported JE case fromthe Philippines this year. In the past five years (from 2020 to 2024), no JE cases were recorded in Hong Kong, and a total of 10 cases were recorded between 2016 and 2019 (including six locally infected cases).

""The current high temperatures and rainfall levels continue to pose risks of transmission of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong. Aedes albopictus, which is the vector for chikungunya virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, is common in Hong Kong. Although these mosquito-borne diseases are not transmitted from person to person, during the early stage after the onset of symptoms (especially when a fever is present), the blood of infected patients contains a large amount of virus, which is infectious to mosquitoes. If people are bitten by mosquitoes during the communicable period, further local transmission via mosquitoes is possible,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

""JE is prevalent in rural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific Region, especially in the hot season. As Culexmosquitoes (including Culex tritaeniorhynchus), the primary vector for JE, can be found in Hong Kong, especially in the rural areas, there is also a risk of transmission of JE locally. Culexmosquitoes breed in areas where there is a lot of stagnant water, and pigs or wild birds are natural hosts of the JE virus. Culexmosquitoes become infected when they bite pigs or wild birds infected with the JE virus.The infected mosquitoes then transmit the virus to humans and animals during biting.Therefore, members of the public should take proper mosquito control measures both locally and during travel. We must make a concerted effort in eliminating mosquito breeding, so as to cut the transmission links of mosquito-borne diseases in the community,"" Dr Tsui added.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the CF patients, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspectionof the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on mosquito-borne diseases prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Besides, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of the mosquito-borne diseases.

Dr Tsui reminded members of the public that those returning to Hong Kong from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should continue to apply insect repellent and closely monitor their personal health condition. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical attention immediately and inform their doctors of their travel history. The public should avoid using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), to prevent aggravating the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication.

Members of the public should also adopt anti-mosquito measures during the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
蚊傳疾病最新情況,2025-08-22 18:30,2025-08-22 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200669.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月二十二日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

本港過去一星期沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案，今年累計錄得九宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，全部個案已康復出院，沒有出現併發症。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

登革熱方面，本港過去一星期亦沒有新增個案，今年暫時錄得41宗外地傳入的登革熱個案。二○二四年共錄得161宗登革熱個案，包括156宗外地傳入及五宗本地感染個案。

日本腦炎方面，本港今年錄得一宗從菲律賓輸入的日本腦炎個案。過去五年（二○二○年至二○二四年），本港沒有錄得日本腦炎個案，而二○一六年至二○一九年共錄得十宗個案（當中包括六宗本地感染個案）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「現時溫度及雨量處於高水平，令多種蚊傳疾病在香港出現傳播的風險持續。可傳播基孔肯雅病毒、登革熱病毒及寨卡病毒的白紋伊蚊在本港很常見。雖然這些蚊傳疾病不會人傳人，但感染的病人在發病後初期（尤其是在發燒期間），血液會帶有大量病毒，對蚊子具傳染性。如在傳染期被蚊子叮咬，有機會透過蚊子在本地進一步傳播。」

他續說：「日本腦炎主要流行於亞洲及西太平洋地區的郊外及農村，尤其在氣候炎熱的季節。由於香港有傳播日本腦炎的主要病媒蚊庫蚊（包括三帶喙庫蚊），尤其是在郊區，因此本地亦存在傳播風險。庫蚊一般於有大量積水的地方繁殖，豬或野生雀鳥屬日本腦炎病毒的天然宿主，庫蚊叮咬帶病毒的豬或野生雀鳥後就會受感染，再於叮咬人類或動物時將病毒傳播。因此，市民無論在本港或外遊都應採取防蚊措施。大家亦必須齊心協助杜絕蚊患，方能截斷本地出現傳播蚊傳疾病的傳播鏈。」

繼續加強防控蚊傳疾病

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於基孔肯雅熱病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防蚊傳疾病的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊已透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解相關疾病的預防及提供外遊健康建議。此外，外展分隊亦已提醒全港所有安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關蚊傳疾病的症狀和預防措施。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況。如出現不適，應立即求醫並告知外遊史，並應避免使用非類固醇消炎止痛藥（如布洛芬），以免加劇出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

在雨季期間，市民亦應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Through intelligence analysis and with the assistance of copyright owners, Customs earlier identified a number of party rooms suspected of possessing and providing infringing karaoke songs to customers in the course of business. Customs officers then took enforcement action and raided 40 party rooms in various districts, including Tuen Mun, Kwai Chung, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui and Kwun Tong. A total of 40 sets of karaoke devices used for playing suspected infringing songs and a batch of audio and video equipment with a total estimated market value of about $1.24 million were seized. Four men and four women, involving seven persons-in-charge of the party rooms and one staff member, aged between 26 and 41, were arrested on suspicion of contravening the Copyright Ordinance. All arrested persons were released on bail pending investigation.The investigation is ongoing and further arrests are not ruled out.

During the investigation, Customs found 23 party rooms located in industrial buildings that were suspected of breaching the lease conditions and they have been referred to the Lands Department for further follow-up action.

Customs reminds business operators to comply with the Ordinance and to make enquiries tocopyright owners on matters relating to the use of musical visual recordings in the course of business.

Customs will continue to step up inspection and enforcement to vigorously combat different kinds of infringing activities to safeguard the rights of copyright owners.

Under the Ordinance, any person, who without the licence of the copyright owner of a copyright work, possesses infringing copies of a copyright work for the purpose of, or in the course of, any trade or business with a view to it being used by any person commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $50,000 per infringing copy and imprisonment for four years.

Members of the public may report any suspected infringing activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
Buildings Department instigates prosecutions in relation to residential development project at Anderson Road,2025-08-22 18:12,2025-08-22 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200652.htm,"âA spokesman for the Buildings Department (BD) said today (August 22) that regarding the steel reinforcements of some structural elements in the superstructure works at a construction site at Anderson Road, Kwun Tong, which had not been installed in accordance with the requirements of the Buildings Ordinance (Chapter 123) (BO), the BD has initiated 205 prosecutions.

The spokesman said, ""The BD received a report in August last year alleging that the steel reinforcements of some structural elements in the superstructure works at a construction site at Anderson Road, Kwun Tong, had not been installed in accordance with the requirements of the BO. The site is related to a residential development involving six multi-storey towers. The BD subsequently served an order requiring the entire site to cease works, deployed its staff to carry out multiple site inspections and required the project's registered structural engineer (RSE) and registered general building contractor (RGBC) to open up the concrete at various locations in the superstructure of the six towers for investigation. The results revealed material deviations in part of the steel reinforcement installation from the approved plans in the six towers, including positional discrepancy and displacement of steel reinforcements, discrepancy in the size of steel reinforcements, fewer steel reinforcements than those shown in the approved plans, as well as misalignment of structural columns.""

  ""Based on the investigation findings, the BD found that the RGBCs and individuals directly concerned with the building works have violated the BO. After consultation with the Department of Justice, the BD has initiated 204 prosecutions under section 40(2A)(b) of the BO against the former and current RGBCs, the authorised signatories of the former and current RGBCs, and four technically competent persons directly concerned with the building works, involving a total of two companies and six individuals; and also one prosecution under section 40(2AB) of the BO against one of the technically competent persons concerned."" 

Although there is no obvious danger to the overall structure of the six buildings, the BD is closely following up with the project RSE on the incident report and the necessary remedial measures, including localised strengthening of the buildings, demolition of parts of the structural elements where necessary, and the reinstallation of steel reinforcements and recasting of concrete.

Pursuant to section 40(2A)(b) of the BO, any person for whom any prescribed inspection or building works or street works are being carried out and any authorised person, RSE, registered geotechnical engineer, registered inspector, qualified person, registered general building contractor, registered specialist contractor or registered minor works contractor directly concerned with any such inspection or works who diverges or deviates in any material way from any work shown in a plan approved by the Building Authority under the BO shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $1 million and imprisonment for three years.

Pursuant to section 40(2AB) of the BO, any person (whether or not an authorised person, a RSE, a registered geotechnical engineer, a registered general building contractor, a registered specialist contractor or a registered minor works contractor) directly concerned with any building works or street works set out in items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Column A in the table to section 17(1) who contravenes any condition imposed under that section in respect of such building works or street works, or the plans thereof, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for one year."

The FEHD has so far announced seven batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering 42 survey areas. Among these 42 survey areas, 26 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared with the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained at a low level. Eleven other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Among the seventh batch of indexes released, Tsing Yi North in Kwai Tsing District and Tuen Mun West in Tuen Mun District recorded an index over 10 per cent. In accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation that strengthens mosquito control work in areas with the gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, which was originally activated when the gravidtrap index reaches 20 per cent or above, the FEHD is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestation and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, the gravidtrap data for Tsing Yi North showed that the areas with more mosquito problems included parks, public and private housing estates. The gravidtrap index for Tsing Yi North dropped from 15.5 per cent in July to 12.7 per cent in first phase in August. The gravidtrap data for Tuen Mun West showed that the areas with more mosquito problems included parks, schools and private housing estates. The gravidtrap index for Tuen Mun West dropped from 10.6 per cent in July to 10.3 per cent in August. The relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up on the mosquito control work. Additionally, the FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap indexes in those two areas to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue joining hands in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:


tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest Gravidtrap Index and the Density Index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools, to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共七批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共42個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這42個監察區中，有26個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有11區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

至於第七批公布的指數高於10%的包括葵青區青衣北及屯門區屯門西，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者攜手，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。其中，青衣北誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、公共屋邨及私人屋苑，該監察地區的誘蚊器指數由七月份的15.5%下跌至八月份由第一階段的12.7%，屯門西誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、學校及私人屋苑，該監察地區的誘蚊器指數由七月份的10.6%下跌至八月份的10.3%，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該兩個地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：
​

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

李家超歡迎周祖翼書記率領代表團訪港。他表示，閩港兩地同處泛珠三角區域，文化淵源深厚、經貿往來頻繁，香港亦是福建省最大境外投資來源地。兩地政府自二○一五年成立閩港合作會議機制以來，在金融、經貿投資、創新科技、青年交流等不同領域展開全方位的交流合作，成果豐碩。他有信心兩地繼續優勢互補，共同服務國家高質量發展。

李家超表示，很高興有福建企業參與今年五月由他親自率領的商貿代表團，一同訪問中東卡塔爾和科威特，開拓商機。這正正充分體現了香港擔當內地出海平台角色。特區政府會繼續積極參與和貢獻國家「一帶一路」建設，發揮好「一帶一路」功能平台的作用。

李家超說，香港是亞洲唯一擁有五所百強大學的城市，匯聚海內外科研人才，基礎科研實力雄厚，正全力發展成為國際創新科技中心。現時香港多間大學與福建的大學有合作研究項目，涵蓋生物醫學、海洋科學和環境生態等範疇。他期待進一步加強閩港兩地的科研合作，促進兩地創科產業發展，為國家科技強國建設貢獻力量。"

The Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs, Mr Erick Tsang Kwok-wai, and the Director of the Chief Executive's Office, Ms Carol Yip, also attended the meeting.

Mr Lee welcomed Mr Zhou and his delegation to Hong Kong. He noted that both Hong Kong and Fujian are located in the Pan-Pearl River Delta region, sharing deep cultural ties and frequent economic and trade exchanges, with Hong Kong being the largest source of external investment for Fujian. Since the establishment of the Hong Kong/Fujian Co-operation Conference mechanism in 2015, the two governments have achieved fruitful results through comprehensive exchanges and collaborations in various areas, including finance, trade and investment, innovation and technology (I&T), and youth exchanges. He expressed confidence that the two places will continue to leverage their complementary strengths to jointly contribute to the country's high-quality development.

Mr Lee said that he was pleased to have Fujian enterprises participating in the business delegation he led in May this year, which visited Qatar and Kuwait in the Middle East to explore business opportunities. This fully exemplified Hong Kong's role as a platform for Mainland enterprises to expand overseas. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to actively participate in and contribute to the country's Belt and Road Initiative, playing fully its role as a functional platform for the initiative.

Mr Lee remarked that Hong Kong is the only city in Asia with five universities ranked among the world's top 100, attracting research talent both at home and from abroad. With a strong foundation in basic research, Hong Kong is fully committed to developing into an international I&T hub. Currently, several universities in Hong Kong are engaged in collaborative research projects with universities in Fujian, covering areas such as biomedical science, marine science, and environmental ecology. He said he looks forward to further strengthening research co-operation between Fujian and Hong Kong, promoting the development of I&T industries in both places, and contributing to the country's development into a nation that is strong in science and technology."

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-08-22 16:00,2025-08-22 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200363.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (August 22) released the latest grading of water quality for 39 gazetted beaches (see Note 1) and one non-gazetted beach (see Note 2).

  Thirteen beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), 22 as Fair (Grade 2) and five as Poor (Grade 3).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Cheung Chau Tung Wan Beach*
St. Stephen's Beach


Hap Mun Bay Beach*
Stanley Main Beach*


Hung Shing Yeh Beach*
Tai Po Lung Mei Beach*


Kiu Tsui Beach
Tong Fuk Beach


Kwun Yam Beach
Turtle Cove Beach


Lo So Shing Beach
Upper Cheung Sha Beach


Shek O Beach*





Grade 2 beaches are:



Anglers' Beach*
Kadoorie Beach


Butterfly Beach*
Lido Beach*

  Compared with the grading released last week, Chung Hom Kok Beach, Clear Water Bay Second Beach, Repulse Bay Beach, Silverstrand Beach, South Bay Beach and Trio Beach have been changed from Grade 1 to Grade 2.

  ""The changes are generally within the normal range of fluctuation of the bacteriological water quality of the beaches,"" an EPD spokesman said.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, the EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

Note 1: Lifesaving services are provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department at 21 gazetted beaches, marked with an asterisk (*) above, from June 1. For details, please refer to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department's Special Announcement (www.lcsd.gov.hk/en/beach/index.html).

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 21 to noon today (August 22), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 191 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 52 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 159 828 samples of food imported from Japan (including 104 657 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 36 250 samples of local catch respectively.

國家自一九六五年起為香港供應東江水，是維持香港繁榮穩定的重要基石。延綿不絕的東江之水翻山而來，不但緩解了香港的缺水問題，更體現了內地與香港同胞血濃於水的深厚情誼。這個全長83公里的大型跨流域供水工程，在短短一年建成。來自珠三角地區上萬名建設者付出了血汗，當中包括200多名來自廣東工學院（今廣東工業大學）的師生，展覽將介紹他們當年在工程中揮灑青春熱血的故事。

展覽亦設有互動問答遊戲，讓市民從多角度了解這個龐大的供水工程，以及節約用水的方法。場內並展示較早前舉行的「慶祝東江水供港60周年」小學親子繪畫比賽得獎作品。

展覽由弘揚辦和水務署聯合籌劃，香港歷史博物館和紫荊雜誌社為支持單位。有關展覽詳情，請瀏覽網頁https://www.ccpo.gov.hk/tc/programme/an-inseparable-bond-our-blessed-origin-60th-anniversary-of-dongjiang-water-supply-to-hong-kong-exhibition/。

Total lunar eclipse in Hong Kong on overnight of September 7,2025-08-22 15:00,2025-08-22 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025081900629.htm,"âA total lunar eclipse will occur in Hong Kong on the late night of September 7 (Sunday) to the early hours of September 8 (Monday). The elevation of the moon will be relatively high during the eclipse. The whole event can be directly observed with unaided eyes at places with an unobstructed view to the south and southwest if weather permits.

The lunar eclipse will begin at 11.26pm on September 7. The moon will start entering the umbra of the Earth at 0.27am on September 8 and will be completely engulfed in the umbra at 1.30am, marking the beginning of the phase of total eclipse. The maximum eclipse will occur at 2.12am, and the moon will begin its exit from the umbra at 2.53am. The phase of total eclipse will last for one hour and 23 minutes. During the period, the moon will not completely disappear from sight but will appear dull red. This is the result of the blue light component of the sunlight being scattered by the Earth's atmosphere and the remaining red light being refracted onto the lunar surface. The entire process of lunar eclipse will end at 4.57am on September 8.

Details of this total lunar eclipse are as follows.

Hong Kong Museum of History to hold exhibition on 60th anniversary of Dongjiang water supply to Hong Kong from tomorrow (with photos),2025-08-22 15:00,2025-08-22 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200251.htm,"  To commemorate and celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Dongjiang water supply to Hong Kong, the Chinese Culture Promotion Office (CCPO) of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and the Water Supplies Department (WSD) jointly present ""An Inseparable Bond, Our Blessed Origin: 60th Anniversary of Dongjiang Water Supply to Hong Kong"" Exhibition, at the Lobby, 1/F, Hong Kong Museum of History, from tomorrow (August 23) to December 15. Admission is free. With rare historical photos and text descriptions, the exhibition showcases Hong Kong's response to drought in the 1960s, the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Construction Project, and the ongoing efforts of the governments of Guangdong and Hong Kong to ensure the quality and quantity of the Dongjiang water supply.

 The supply of Dongjiang water to Hong Kong since 1965 serves as an important cornerstone for maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Coming from the mountains, the continuous flow of Dongjiang water not only alleviates Hong Kong's water shortage but also symbolises the inseparable blood ties and deep friendship between the people of the Mainland and Hong Kong. Spanning 83 kilometres, this large-scale inter-basin water supply project was completed in just one year, with contributions from tens of thousands of builders from the Pearl River Delta, including over 200 faculty members and students from Guangdong Industrial Institute (now Guangdong University of Technology). The exhibition introduces their stories of pouring their youthful passion into the project.

 The exhibition also features an interactive quiz game, allowing members of the public to understand this vast water supply project from multiple perspectives, and tips on water conservation. It also displays award-winning entries from the ""Celebration of the 60th Anniversary of Dongjiang Water Supply to Hong Kong"" Primary School Parent-child Drawing Competition held earlier.

 The exhibition is jointly organised by the CCPO and the WSD, and supported by the Hong Kong Museum of History and Bauhinia Magazine. For details of the exhibition, please visit the website:www.ccpo.gov.hk/en/programme/an-inseparable-bond-our-blessed-origin-60th-anniversary-of-dongjiang-water-supply-to-hong-kong-exhibition/

 The exhibition is one of the activities to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Dongjiang water supply to Hong Kong under the theme ""Dongjiang River - An Inseparable Bond, Our Blessed Origin"". Through various activities, the Government aims to enhance public understanding of the importance of Dongjiang water to Hong Kong's prosperity, stability and long-term development as well as the country's longstanding care and support for Hong Kong."

大家好！我很開心今日出席由香港電腦商會主辦的香港電腦通訊節2025。電腦節由二○○四年開始，至今已經舉辦超過20年，除了是本地資訊科技界的年度盛事外，同時亦是深受香港市民歡迎的活動。

人工智能發展一日千里，AI（人工智能）已經逐漸融入我們的日常生活。現在人人都說AI，所以今年大會的主題是「AI無界，商機無限」，設立了「AI及數碼轉型專區」，幫助企業了解最新的AI技術和數碼解決方案，推動企業在數碼時代下提升競爭力和持續創新；另外還設有「AI 科技：全民體驗未來」論壇，由業界精英主講，分享行業的成功案例。今次大會更聯同多間本地創新公司，打造「機械人體驗區」，讓市民近距離接觸，了解機械人科技如何改變未來生活和工作模式。

特區政府一直致力推動數碼轉型。現在我們的「智方便」登記用戶已經突破360萬，提供超過1 200項網上服務和政府電子表格。今日現場有我們「智方便」的攤位，還未登記的市民都可以去攤位登記，更可以升級至有數碼簽署功能的「智方便+」。

隨着生成式人工智能的興起，我們的香港生成式人工智能研發中心（HKGAI）自主研發了本地大語言基礎模型，並且開發出數個垂直應用，包括目前在政府內部使用的「港文通」和「港會通」，以及即將推出市場的聊天機械人「港話通」。「港話通」目前正處於測試階段，相信今年內市民大眾就可以使用。

今年的電腦節還有很多精彩節目，有「未來生活虛擬體驗區」、第五屆「5G及綠色科技生活館」，以及由香港資訊科技聯會和香港電腦商會合辦的「一帶一路軟件博覽館（香港）2025」等，多姿多采的展覽加上各式各樣的產品，希望大家多買些，睇得開心些。

另外，九月七日是二○二五選舉委員會界別分組補選的日子，合資格的選民記得投票，你的一票很重要。

最後，我再次感謝香港電腦商會多年來為推廣資訊科技應用和數碼生活普及化所作的貢獻。我祝願香港電腦通訊節2025圓滿成功！各位參展商生意興隆，各位朋友滿載而歸。多謝大家！"

尊敬的周霽主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室主任）、董經緯署長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署署長）、崔建春特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署特派員）、譚志偉副司令員（中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊副司令員）、李大宏董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團董事長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家早上好。今天開幕的「紀念中國人民抗日戰爭暨世界反法西斯戰爭勝利80周年」大型巡迴展覽，有助我們銘記歷史、珍愛和平。我首先恭賀展覽順利舉行。

中國人民抗日戰爭，是中華民族團結共抗外敵持續時間最長、規模最大、犧牲最多的戰爭，全國人民以巨大民族犧牲，支撐起世界反法西斯戰爭的東方主戰場，為世界反法西斯戰爭勝利作出了貢獻。抗戰勝利，是中華民族團結奮進，邁向偉大復興的轉捩點。

八十載崢嶸歲月，八十載砥礪奮進。中華兒女不屈不撓的偉大抗戰精神，在八十年後的今天，仍然刻骨銘心。先烈以偉大犧牲保家衞國、堅守民族尊嚴，是今天國家繁榮昌盛的基石，是今天人民安居樂業的起點。

這次展覽由大公文匯傳媒集團主辦，並由內地和香港多個政府單位和抗戰組織支持和協辦，在香港會議展覽中心展出後，會在香港18區和學校進行巡展。我期望香港市民通過展覽，和特區政府與各民間團體舉辦的抗戰勝利80周年紀念活動，更全面、更立體地認識這段中華民族不能磨滅的共同記憶，這段歷史提醒我們很多人生意義。

第一，眾志成城，團結無懼艱苦的磅礡偉力。在長達14年的漫長抗戰中，面對山河淪喪、民族被踐踏，全國人民在抗日民族統一戰線下，不分你我、不分地域，全面投身抗日活動。這些人和你我一樣，從事不同的工作、有着不同的背景、處於不同的年齡。他們都懷着一顆愛國的心，在各自崗位發揮自己力量，共同支援祖國抗日。

前人的經歷啓示我們，團結合力的民族意志和愛國精神，可以以弱勝強，成功捍衞祖國的河山、民族的尊嚴，洗刷多年外侮屈辱。中華兒女在抗戰上，向世界展示了天下興亡、匹夫有責的愛國情懷和民族氣節，激勵我們自強不息、乘風破浪、奮勇前行。

第二，居安思危，築牢珍愛和平的金城湯池。80年後的今天，中華民族偉大復興道路不可逆轉。但我們必須認識清楚侵略主義、霸權主義未有真正停止，這一刻的世界，仍有很多平民深陷戰火，使人聞者心傷。

抗戰的悲壯啓示我們，在國家前進的道路上，會面對各種風險和挑戰，敵對勢力不時蠢蠢欲動，妄圖阻攔國家和平發展。我們必須時刻牢記歷史，警惕美化侵略的言論，自覺維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，以偉大抗戰精神展示的決心和勇氣，為和平構建人類命運共同體，堅持不懈奮鬥。

第三，薪火相傳，永續民族復興的歷史使命。在這場艱苦卓絕的抗爭中，香港民眾與全國同胞血脈相連，從營救文化人士、奔赴抗戰前線，到籌集運送物資、宣傳抗日信息等，香港從未缺位，一直與祖國患難與共、並肩作戰。

歷史教訓我們，要以史為鑑，珍愛和平、堅持和平，撫今追昔，珍惜先烈以鮮血換來的和平、堅定站在正義的一方。我希望大家珍惜展覽和一系列抗戰勝利80周年活動的難得機會，學習前人為民族、為國家貢獻的力量，向家人和朋友分享你們的體會，把抗戰精神代代相傳。

前事不忘，後事之師。我們必須銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平，不負先輩的犧牲和他們對和平和國家強盛的渴望，為中華民族、為世界開創更輝煌的未來。

我祝願展覽圓滿成功，在座各位平安健康、生活美滿。謝謝大家。"

抗戰的悲壯啓示我們，在國家前進的道路上，會面對各種風險和挑戰，敵對勢力不時蠢蠢欲動，妄圖阻攔國家和平發展。我們必須時刻牢記歷史，警惕美化侵略的言論，自覺維護國家主權、安全、發展利益，以偉大抗戰精神展示的決心和勇氣，為和平構建人類命運共同體，堅持不懈奮鬥。

第三，薪火相傳，永續民族復興的歷史使命。在這場艱苦卓絕的抗爭中，香港民眾與全國同胞血脈相連，從營救文化人士、奔赴抗戰前線，到籌集運送物資、宣傳抗日信息等，香港從未缺位，一直與祖國患難與共、並肩作戰。

歷史教訓我們，要以史為鑑，珍愛和平、堅持和平，撫今追昔，珍惜先烈以鮮血換來的和平、堅定站在正義的一方。我希望大家珍惜展覽和一系列抗戰勝利80周年活動的難得機會，學習前人為民族、為國家貢獻的力量，向家人和朋友分享你們的體會，把抗戰精神代代相傳。

前事不忘，後事之師。我們必須銘記歷史、緬懷先烈、珍愛和平，不負先輩的犧牲和他們對和平和國家強盛的渴望，為中華民族、為世界開創更輝煌的未來。

我祝願展覽圓滿成功，在座各位平安健康、生活美滿。謝謝大家。"

Officers will also publicise the relevant smoking ban regulations to members of the public.

From January 2021 to June 2025, TACO has conducted over 19 400 inspections at public transport facilities regarding smoking offences, and issued more than 9 400 fixed penalty notices/summons.

The DH also reminded the public that, effective from August 31, 10 public transport facilities (PTFs) will be newly designated as no smoking areas (NSAs), and one PTF's NSA will be revised under the Smoking (Public Health) (Designation of No Smoking Areas) (Amendment) Notice 2025.

The 10 PTFs newly designated as NSAs are:
1. Chai Wan (East) Temporary Bus Terminus;
2. Exhibition Centre Station Public Transport Interchange, Wan Chai;
3. Wong Chuk Hang Station Public Transport Facilities;
4. Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port Public Transport Interchange;
5. Kwai Tsui Estate Public Transport Interchange, Kwai Chung;
6. Pak Tam Chung Bus Terminus, Sai Kung;
7. Tuen Mun Central Bus Terminus;
8. Tung Chung Development Pier Bus Terminus;
9. Yau Oi (South) Bus Terminus, Tuen Mun (temporarily closed); and
10. Yuen Long (Tak Yip Street) Bus Terminus.

The one PTF with revised NSA is Central Ferry Piers Public Transport Interchange.

To protect public health, it is the established policy of the Government to discourage smoking, contain the proliferation of tobacco use and protect the public from second-hand smoke. The Notice was gazetted on May 30 this year and will take effect on August 31, expanding the smoking ban to 272 PTFs throughout the territory.

No-smoking signs and layout plans are put up, and demarcation lines are displayed to clearly indicate the boundaries with regard to the respective physical settings at the NSAs to remind the public of the smoke-free requirements. Plans showing the boundaries of the NSAs are available in the Land Registry, and will be uploaded to the TACO's website for public inspection.

Any person who does a smoking act in NSAs or in public transport carriers will be liable for a fixed penalty of $1,500. Tobacco and Alcohol Control Inspectors will prosecute smoking offenders without prior warning.

For the sake of the health of individuals, their families and others, the Government appeals to smokers to quit smoking as early as possible. Members of the public may call the DH's Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline on 1833 183, which is operated by registered nurses to provide professional counselling services on smoking cessation."

The extent of the area of foreshore and seabed affected is described in a notice gazetted today (August 22).

âThe proposed works comprise the installation of a submarine cable system of approximately 36.8 kilometres in length and 130 millimetres in diameter. The proposed works are tentatively scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of 2025 and are expected to be completed in approximately four months.

The notice and its related plan are posted near the site. The plan is also available for inspection at:

Tenders for operation and management contracts of Light Public Housing invited (with photo),2025-08-22 11:00,2025-08-22 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200225.htm,"âThe Housing Bureau (HB) today (August 22) invites tenders for the ninth and 10th operation and management contracts of Light Public Housing (LPH), and encourages capable and experienced organisations to participate.

The two contracts, relating to the LPH project at Yan Po Road, Tuen Mun (i.e. Tuen Mun Area 54), are for the operation and management of about 2 800 units each. The entire LPH project at Yan Po Road, Tuen Mun, will provide about 5 600 units in total and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of next year.

A spokesperson for the HB said, ""Taking into account that the LPH project at Yan Po Road, Tuen Mun, is relatively larger in scale, it is divided into two separate contracts so as to encourage participation from different experienced and aspirational organisations.""

  As with the contracts already awarded, the operation and management services for the LPH not only cover occupant management, property management and daily maintenance, but also the provision of social services, as well as the management and operation of ancillary facilities, etc. To encourage participation of different stakeholders in the community, the HB welcomes tenders from all capable and experienced service providers, including non-government organisations and those with a valid property management company licence, or collaborations between them.

To ensure service quality, the HB will carry out technical assessments based on a series of factors, including the management capability, relevant experience and past service performance of the organisations, as well as the proposed modes of operation and management, social services to be provided, feasibility of exit plan and use of innovation and information technology as stated in their proposals, so that the facilities and services of the LPH can meet the needs of the residents and the local community. The tender price will then be evaluated to form a consolidated assessment to decide on the most suitable organisation for operating the LPH.

The HB has so far awarded four LPH operation and management contracts, covering the projects at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long; Choi Hing Road and Choi Shek Lane (i.e. the former St Joseph's Anglo-Chinese School), Ngau Tau Kok; Tsing Fuk Lane, Tuen Mun (i.e. Tuen Mun Area 3A); and Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak (Phase 1). Separately, the HB is now evaluating tenders for the fifth and sixth operation and management contracts covering the four school conversion projects and the LPH project at Sheung On Street, Chai Wan, respectively. Tenders for the seventh and eighth operation and management contracts, both covering Phase 2 of the LPH project at Olympic Avenue, Kai Tak, are being invited.

The spokesperson said, ""The tenant intake for the first LPH project at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, providing about 2 100 units, was fully completed in mid-June this year. The second LPH project at Choi Hing Road, which provides about 2 290 units, is the first project in an urban area with full intake expected to complete soon. This fully demonstrates that with affordable rent, comprehensive facilities and services, as well as a better living environment, LPH projects are highly popular among residents in need. The HB just announced the Composite Waiting Time for Subsidised Rental Housing (CWT) for the second quarter of 2025. The CWT for general applicants has decreased by 0.2 years to 5.1 years, which is the lowest since the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, the waiting time for general applicants of LPH is 2.3 years on average, showing that LPH can quickly address the urgent demand for improving living conditions of households in need. Moreover, about 70 per cent of the residents at Choi Hing Road LPH had previously resided in inadequate housing, such as sub-divided units, rooftop houses and bedspaces. Their livelihood has been greatly improved right after moving into LPH.""

Interested organisations may download the tender documents via the relevant tender notices on the HB's website (www.hb.gov.hk) or from the e-Tendering System; or contact the Dedicated Team on Light Public Housing under the HB for obtaining the tender documents. The Tender References are HB2025/OPR-LPH-YNP1 and HB2025/OPR-LPH-YNP2 respectively.

Tenderers must submit the tenders by noon on October 10, 2025 (Friday), either electronically via the e-Tendering System or by deposit in the Government Secretariat Tender Box situated at the Lobby of the Public Entrance on the Ground Floor, East Wing, Central Government Offices, 2 Tim Mei Avenue, Tamar. Late tenders will not be accepted."

房屋局就「簡約公屋」營運及管理服務合約招標（附圖）,2025-08-22 11:00,2025-08-22 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200223.htm,"​房屋局今日（八月二十二日）就「簡約公屋」項目的第九及第十份營運及管理服務合約進行招標，並鼓勵有能力和經驗的機構積極參與。

兩份合約均涉及屯門欣寶路（即屯門第54區）「簡約公屋」項目，分別負責營運及管理各約2 800個單位。整個屯門欣寶路項目共提供約5 600個單位，預計明年第三季落成。

房屋局發言人表示：「由於屯門欣寶路項目規模較大，我們將項目分拆兩份合約進行招標，讓更多有經驗、有抱負的不同機構有機會參與營運管理。」

與之前批出的合約一樣，「簡約公屋」的營運及管理服務除包括住戶事務管理、物業管理、日常保養維修，亦涵蓋社會服務，以及管理和營運一系列配套設施等範疇。為推動社會上不同持份者的參與，房屋局歡迎有能力和經驗的服務承辦商投標，包括非政府機構及持有物業管理公司牌照的機構，或是兩者合作。

為確保服務質素，房屋局會根據投標機構的管理能力、相關經驗、過往的服務表現，以及其計劃書內建議的營運和管理模式、提供的社會服務、遷出計劃的可行性、創新和資訊科技的應用等一系列因素作出技術評審，務求令「簡約公屋」的設施和服務切合居民和地區需要，再就投標價格作出綜合評審，選出最合適的機構負責營運「簡約公屋」。

房屋局至今已批出四份「簡約公屋」營運及管理服務合約，涵蓋元朗攸壆路、牛頭角彩興路及彩石里（即前聖若瑟英文中學）、屯門青福里（即屯門第3A區），以及第一期啟德世運道項目。另外，房屋局正在評審第五及第六份營運及管理服務合約的投標書，分別涉及四個改裝校舍項目，以及柴灣常安街項目。房屋局亦正為第七及第八份營運及管理服務合約招標，兩份合約均涉及第二期啟德世運道「簡約公屋」項目。

發言人說：「位於元朗攸壆路約2 100個『簡約公屋』單位已在今年六月中全面入伙，而作為第二個落成及首個位於市區的彩興路『簡約公屋』項目約2 290個單位亦預期快將完成入伙，充分反映租金便宜、配套服務齊全、居住環境更好的『簡約公屋』項目，相當受有需要的市民歡迎。房屋局剛公布二○二五年第二季公屋綜合輪候時間，一般申請者的綜合輪候時間下降0.2年至5.1年，是二○一八年第一季以來的最低位；而當中『簡約公屋』的一般申請者的輪候時間平均為2.3年，可見『簡約公屋』能快速回應急需改善居住環境家庭的需要。此外，約七成彩興路『簡約公屋』的住戶原先居住在不適切住房，例如『劏房』、天台屋和床位等，他們入住『簡約公屋』後生活即時得以大幅改善。」

有興趣投標的機構可透過房屋局網頁（www.hb.gov.hk）內相關的招標公告或進入「電子投標系統」下載招標文件，或聯絡房屋局轄下的「簡約公屋」專責小組索取招標文件，招標編號分別為HB2025/OPR-LPH-YNP1及HB2025/OPR-LPH-YNP2。

投標者須於二○二五年十月十日（星期五）中午十二時前透過「電子投標系統」提交電子投標書，或把投標書放入添馬添美道2號政府總部東翼地下公眾入口大堂的「政府總部投標箱」內遞交。逾期的投標概不受理。"

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-22 06:45,2025-08-22 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082200123.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 22) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

倫敦經貿辦處長周雪梅於八月二十日（愛丁堡時間）兩場演出開始前向觀眾致辭，強調香港在國家《十四五規劃綱要》的支持下致力進一步提升作為中外文化藝術交流中心的地位。

周雪梅表示：「香港特別行政區政府一直積極培育本地藝術人才，並拓展國際發展機遇。同時，政府一直投放資源在世界級藝術基建，包括全新啟德體育園五萬座位的主場館，以及於二○二四年成功舉辦首屆香港演藝博覽，吸引世界各地藝術家及文化機構參與。」

周雪梅指出，香港與愛丁堡近年在文化及商貿領域聯繫日益緊密，她歡迎愛丁堡企業探索香港多元化的商機。她以去年香港實施雙層烈酒稅制為例說明香港便利營商的策略，此舉進一步推動香港成為高端酒類貿易及拍賣中心，並帶動物流、旅遊及高端餐飲等高增值行業的發展，這些發展為愛丁堡與香港之間更廣泛的合作開啟大門。

愛丁堡藝穗節於八月一日至二十五日在英國愛丁堡舉行，上演其中三個香港節目包括：一桌兩椅慈善基金會演出的《粵劇x兒童互動劇場：的的撐撐遊樂園》、「一舖清唱」的《石堅》無伴奏音樂劇場歷險，以及由萬幸聯同兩位英國音樂家Eleanor Dunsdon和Gregor Black帶來中國與蘇格蘭音樂交流表演（Waves of Tradition: A New Horizon in Scottish-Chinese Music）。三個節目不但展現香港多元文化底蘊，亦進一步鞏固香港作為國際文化交流平台的地位。"
Hong Kong performers bring East-meets-West creativity to Edinburgh Festival Fringe (with photos),2025-08-22 00:06,2025-08-22 00:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/22/P2025082100928.htm," The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, London (London ETO) supported three Hong Kong performance programmes at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2025, highlighting the city's vibrant arts scene. The performances featured the One Table Two Chairs Charitable Foundation, zheng musician Wan Xing and a cappella group Yat Po Singers.

 The Director-General of the London ETO, Miss Fiona Chau, addressed the audience before two performances staged on August 20 (Edinburgh time). She highlighted Hong Kong's vision of further enhancing its role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, as supported by the National 14th Five-Year Plan.

 ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is firmly committed to nurturing home-grown talent and expanding global opportunities for our artists. We are investing in world-class arts infrastructure, such as the new 50 000-seat stadium at the Kai Tak Sports Park, and have launched flagship events such as the inaugural Hong Kong Performing Arts Expo in 2024, which gathered leading artists and institutions from around the world,"" Miss Chau remarked.

 Noting the growing connections between Hong Kong and Edinburgh, particularly in the cultural and business sectors, Miss Chau welcomed Edinburgh enterprises to explore the diverse business opportunities that Hong Kong has to offer. She highlighted the introduction of a two-tier liquor duty system in Hong Kong last year as an example of the city's strategy to facilitate business. This initiative has encouraged the trade and auctions of high-end liquor in Hong Kong, thereby giving impetus to the development of other high value-added sectors such as logistics and storage, tourism, as well as high-end food and beverage consumption. These developments open the door for even broader collaboration between Edinburgh and Hong Kong.

 Running from August 1 to 25 in Edinburgh, the United Kingdom (UK), the Festival showcased three Hong Kong programmes: ""Cantonese Opera x Children's Interactive Theatre: Dic Dic Chang Chang Playground"" by One Table Two Chairs Charitable Foundation; ""Rock Hard – A Theatrical A Cappella Adventure"" by Yat Po Singers; and ""Waves of Tradition: A New Horizon in Scottish-Chinese Music"" by Wan and two UK musicians, Eleanor Dunsdon and Gregor Black. These performances underscored Hong Kong's vibrant cultural contributions and its role in international cultural exchanges."
Protecting children's vision health has been a long-standing commitment for DH,2025-08-21 20:50,2025-08-21 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100784.htm,"In response to media reports on the visual health of children in Hong Kong, the Department of Health (DH) today (August 21) gave the following response:

""The DH has been safeguarding the physical and psychosocial health of children, including their vision, through health promotion and disease prevention services. One of the major initiatives is to provide regular free assessment services for children in Hong Kong at different stages of their development through the Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) and the Student Health Service (SHS) Centres of the DH. These services enable the early identification of children with visual acuity problems, allowing for the timely provision of advice and intervention, including referrals to appropriate institutions for further assessment or treatment.

Pre-school children

The MCHCs of the DH offer free Pre-School Vision Screening for children aged four to five, aiming to identify those with visual problems, such as amblyopia, squint or significant refractive errors, as early as possible. When necessary, children are referred to ophthalmologists for further visual assessment and treatment to safeguard their vision and visual development. Last year (2024), more than 23 600 children, which were new cases, participated in the Pre-School Vision Screening. Among them, 15 per cent were referred to ophthalmologists for follow-up.

Primary school children

The visual acuity tests provided by the SHS are screening tests. Students will be arranged to undergo the screening service every year regardless of whether they wear glasses. The test aims to detect as early as possible visual acuity problems of the students, and whether the problems so detected have already been appropriately corrected, including wearing suitable glasses.

Those who fail the visual acuity test will be referred to optometrists of the DH's Special Assessment Service for further visual assessment. Parents of the students may also choose to consult private optometrists for assessments and follow-ups.In addition, the SHS will provide a stereoscopic vision test to Primary One students (or those at their first visit) toidentify other visual problems, including amblyopia and squint, for follow-up.

In the 2023/24 school year, around 257 000 primary school students (i.e. about 80 per cent of primary school students in Hong Kong) received free annual health assessment services, including visual acuity tests. Among them, 35.1 per cent of students wore glasses. Upon assessment, it was found that nearly 20 per cent (over 50 000 persons),who failed preliminary visual acuity test or had other eye or visual problems, required further assessment by optometrists in the SHS or private sector. Among these, about 33 000 primary students had never worn glasses.

The DH recommends primary school children aged between six and 12 years old to limit recreational screen time to less than two hours a day. The health assessment questionnaire revealed that 43.3 per cent of primary school students indicated that they spent two or more hours in using Internet or electronic screen products (including computers, tablets, smartphones, video games and television) for recreational purposes on a typical school day. The proportion was higher than in the pre-COVID years of around 30 per cent, which is a cause for concern.

Apart from reminding students of the appropriate recreational screen time, the DH has set up a webpage onHealthy Use of Internet and Electronic Screen Productsto assist parents and teachers in handling related issues.

The DH reminds students to adopt the following health tips to protect their vision when using electronic screen products:

Use proper lighting and reduce glare on the device screen;
Keep a proper distance and posture for screen viewing;
Take rest: follow the 20-20-20 rule (take a 20-second break to view something at least 20 feet away for every 20 minutes);
Follow the 30-40-50 principle: keep a reading distance no less than 50 centimetres for computers, 40cm for tablet personal computers and 30cm for smartphones;
Blink frequently; and
Conduct regular eye checks and adopt good viewing habits.


Registration for the annual health assessment service of the 2025/26 school year will be available through schools in early September. The DH will continue to provide vision screening services and appropriate referrals for children in Hong Kong, and will provide related health promotion activities in order to safeguard the vision and eye health of students."""

相關進口商已按中心指示將受影響批次產品停售及下架，並展開回收。市民可於辦公時間致電相關進口商的熱線查詢，分別為：JJ Global Sourcing Limited（電話：2190 2125）和Classic Fine Foods (Hong Kong) Limited（電話：3145 7819）。

發言人續說：「李斯特菌可在一般烹煮溫度下輕易消滅，但能在冷藏低溫下生存和繁殖。大部分身體健康的人在感染這種細菌後不會出現病徵或只出現輕微病徵如發燒、肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、嘔吐及腹瀉等。但對初生嬰兒、長者和免疫力較低的人，則可能出現嚴重的併發症如敗血症及腦膜炎，甚至死亡。孕婦感染李斯特菌一般症狀輕微，但可導致胎兒流產、夭折、早產，或引致新生嬰兒患上嚴重的感染。」

「為減低感染李斯特菌病的風險，高危人士如孕婦應盡量進食剛煮好的熱食，徹底翻熱冷凍食物，並避免進食或在進食前徹底煮熟高風險食物（即食食物例如凍食肉類、冷燻的海產、軟芝士、沙律等），即使有關食物只屬於一道菜色的一部分。」

發言人說，市民應停止食用受影響產品，如食用有關產品後感到不適，應盡快求醫。

中心會就事件通知業界，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"
CFS urges public not to consume two kinds of French cheese suspected to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,2025-08-21 20:30,2025-08-21 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100783.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (August 21) urged the public not to consume two kinds of cheese originated from France due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The trade should stop using or selling the affected products immediately if they possess any of them.

  The product details are as follows:

  ""The CFS received a notification from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed of the European Commission that the above-mentioned products are being recalled due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately contacted local importers to follow up. A preliminary investigation found that the above-mentioned importers had imported into Hong Kong the affected batches of the products concerned,"" a spokesman for the CFS said.

  The importers concerned have stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected batches of the products and have initiated recalls according to the CFS's instructions. Enquiries can be made to the respective importers' hotlines during office hours. They are: JJ Global Sourcing Limited (Tel: 2190 2125) and Classic Fine Foods (Hong Kong) Limited (Tel: 3145 7819).

  ""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman added.

  ""In order to reduce the risk of listeriosis, susceptible populations such as pregnant women should consume freshly prepared hot food where possible, reheat chilled food until it is hot all the way through, and avoid high-risk foods, including ready-to-eat food such as cold cuts, cold smoked seafood, soft cheeses, salads, etc, or cook them thoroughly before consumption, even if they are presented as part of a dish.""

  The spokesman advised members of the public to stop consuming the affected products and seek medical treatment if they feel unwell after consuming the products concerned.

  The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."
DH urges public to work together to step up mosquito control and prevention measures amid global spread of mosquito-borne diseases,2025-08-21 20:12,2025-08-21 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/21/P2025082100768.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that, as of 5pm today (August 21), no new case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

""Although there have been no new imported cases of CF in the past six consecutive days, high temperatures and rainfall levels continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world. Members of the public must remain vigilant and take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have travel history,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui said.

""As the new school year is about to begin, the CHP also urges educational institutions to follow the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)'s anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. Through the Education Bureau, the CHP will once again remind schools, staff and students to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases on campus. While mosquito-borne diseases are not transmitted from person to person, but it requires the collective effort of the entire community to eliminate mosquito breeding sites in order to effectively prevent such diseases and protect one's own health and one's family members,"" Dr Tsui added.

The following is the latest situation and relevant health information on major mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and worldwide:

1. CF

Hong Kong has recorded nine imported CF cases this year, involving six males and three females aged between 8 and 79 years. Five cases involved individuals who had travelled to Foshan in Guangdong Province during the incubation periods, while four involved individuals who had travelled to Bangladesh. Three patients developed symptoms before returning to Hong Kong and the remaining six patients developed symptoms between the first and the fifth day after returning. Regarding symptoms, all patients experienced fever, and the vast majority (eight cases) reported joint pain, which typically appeared on the same day or the day after the onset of fever. The most commonly affected body parts were the wrists, elbows, knees and ankles.

The public should be aware that, in addition to Foshan in Guangdong Province, many countries worldwide are currently experiencing outbreaks of CF. Before travelling aboard, it is essential to pay attention to the situation of the destinations, and take mosquito prevention and personal protection measures. After returning to Hong Kong from affected areas, it is also necessary to continue monitoring one's health condition.

2. Dengue Fever (DF)

No DF cases were recorded in Hong Kong between August 15 and 20. There have been 41 imported DF cases recorded so far this year. Although the figure is slightly lower than the same period last year, the DF situation remains severe in Hong Kong's neighbouring regions and worldwide. Hence, the risk of continual occurrence of imported cases is still high.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades. In 2024, over 14 million cases were recorded, setting a new record high. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam have each recorded over 20 000 cases so far this year. Singapore has also recorded over 3 000 cases. Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded a total of 586 locally infected cases so far this year, with relatively more cases in Guangzhou, Foshan, Chaozhou and Shenzhen.

DF is also transmitted to humans through the bite of female Aedes mosquitoes carrying the DF virus. Symptoms are similar to those of CF, including high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. The incubation period is usually four to seven days. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a severe form of DF with increased bleeding tendency; the mortality rate can be as high as 20 per cent. Patients who have a second infection with a different serotype of DF virus are more likely to result in DHF.

3. Japanese encephalitis (JE)

The CHP yesterday announced an imported case of JE, marking the first such case recorded in Hong Kong since 2020. The primary vector of JE is the Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Mosquitoes breed in areas where there is a lot of stagnant water, such as rice paddies, and become infected when they bite pigs or wild birds infected with the JE virus. The infected mosquitoes then transmit the virus to humans and animals during biting. JE is prevalent in rural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific Region, especially in hot season. In the subtropics and tropics, transmission can occur year-round, often with a peak during the rainy season.

The incubation period from infection to onset of symptoms is four to 14 days. Most patients with JE have mild symptoms, with no significant symptoms other than fever and headache. However, approximately one in every 250 infections is associated with severe illnesses characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.

4. Zika virus

No infection case of Zika virus had been recorded in Hong Kong this year. However, there were two and three imported cases recorded in 2023 and 2024 respectively, involving patients who had visited India and Thailand during incubation period. Surveillance data revealed that a relatively higher number of infection case of Zika virus have been recorded in the Southeast Asia, India and the Americas.

Aedes aegypti, which is the primary vector for Zika virus, is currently not found in Hong Kong, but other Aedes mosquito species (such as Aedes albopictus) are also considered as potential vectors. Symptoms of Zika including rash, fever, conjunctivitis, headache, muscle and joint pain, but most people infected with Zika Virus are asymptomatic. Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other congenital malformations in infants. Thus, pregnant women should pay close attention to the infection risk and adopt precautions against mosquito-borne diseases if they travel to affected areas.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on mosquito-borne diseases prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Besides, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of the mosquito-borne diseases.

Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. Aedes albopictus, which is the vector for CF, DF and Zika virus, is common in Hong Kong, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus, the primary vector for JE, can also be found in Hong Kong. Members of the public should maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong.

Members of the public returning to Hong Kong from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases should continue to apply insect repellent and monitor their personal health condition. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical attention immediately and inform their doctors of their travel history. The public should avoid using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), to prevent aggravating the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to Reye's syndrome, a serious and potentially fatal complication.
