Hospital Authority's statement regarding an industrial accident at Queen Mary Hospital redevelopment project construction site,2025-07-27 22:41,2025-07-27 23:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700759.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) has the following statement today (July 27) regarding an industrial accident at Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) redevelopment project construction site:

The redevelopment project of QMH is being carried out by the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD). This afternoon, the HA was notified by the ArchSD that a worker employed by a lift engineering subcontractor was trapped in one of the lift shafts during work. The site management of the contractor immediately called Fire Services Department to rescue the worker, who was then sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of QMH for emergency treatment. The worker was certified dead upon arrival at the Accident and Emergency Department.

The HA expresses deep sorrow over this incident and extends its sincere condolences to the deceased worker's family. The HA has directed the ArchSD to ensure that the contractor provides appropriate assistance to the family and supports them in handling the family member's after-death arrangements.

The HA is very concerned about the incident. Since the lifts involved in the project have not yet undergone all required works and adjustments, and have not been handed over for use and management by QMH. The HA is aware that site staff from the ArchSD immediately contacted and followed up with the contractor after the accident. The contractor has been urged to take the incident seriously and to adopt all necessary measures as soon as possible to ensure site safety. The contractor has also been requested to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report to the ArchSD and the HA as soon as possible to prevent similar accidents from happening again.

The HA has always placed paramount importance on industrial safety at hospital construction sites. The HA notes that the contractor will report this incident to the Labour Department, and the HA will also urge the ArchSD and the contractor to fully co-operation with the Labour Department and other relevant enforcement agencies in their investigation."

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（七月二十七日）就瑪麗醫院重建工程地盤的工業意外有以下聲明︰

瑪麗醫院重建工程由建築署負責進行。醫管局今日下午接獲建築署通知，一名受僱其升降機工程分判商的工人在工作期間被困其中一條升降機槽。承建商地盤負責人意外後隨即召喚消防員救出工人，送往瑪麗醫院急症室搶救，工人於送抵急症室後證實死亡。

醫管局對事件感到難過，對離世工人的家人致以深切慰問，已要求建築署確保其工程承建商必須為家屬提供適切協助、妥善照顧家屬及處理工人的後事。

本局非常關注事件。鑑於有關工程內的升降機尚未完成工序及調整，故目前並未交付瑪麗醫院使用及管理。醫管局知悉建築署駐地盤人員在意外發生後隨即向工程承建商了解及跟進事件，已敦促工程承建商必須嚴肅跟進，盡快採取一切必要措施，確保地盤安全，並要求工程承建商徹查事件成因，盡快向建築署及醫管局提交報告，避免再發生類似意外。

本局一直非常重視轄下醫院工程的工業安全，知悉承建商會向勞工處呈報事件，本局亦會督促建築署及承建商全力配合勞工處及相關執法部門的調查。"

HKSAR Government opposes smears against Police lawful enforcement actions,2025-07-27 16:46,2025-07-27 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700516.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (July 27) strongly opposed and disapproved of smears with distorted facts by government officials and politicians from countries like the United States, Canada and Australia, as well as anti-China organisations, on HKSAR's lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong. Not only did such foreign government officials and politicians, as well as anti-China organisations, turned a blind eye to illegal acts of criminals, but also deliberately smeared and spread irresponsible remarks, in an attempt to mislead the public, about the measures and actions taken by the HKSAR Government in accordance with the law. The HKSAR Government strongly disapproved of such acts.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""Acts and activities endangering national security could bring very serious consequences. Prompt actions must be taken to prevent and suppress such acts and activities effectively. According to Article 37 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL), this Law shall apply to a person who is a permanent resident of the HKSAR or an incorporated or unincorporated body such as a company or an organisation which is set up in the HKSAR if the person or the body commits an offence under the HKNSL outside the HKSAR. Additionally, Article 38 of the HKNSL stipulates that this Law shall apply to offences under this Law committed against the HSKAR from outside the HKSAR by a person who is not a permanent resident of the HKSAR. Therefore, the Hong Kong Police Force has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, persons suspected of committing offences under the HKNSL outside Hong Kong.""

""The 'Hong Kong Parliament' is an organisation which aims to subvert state power; its objectives include promoting 'self-determination', promulgating the so-called 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of People's Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR with unlawful means, thereby suspected of having committed the offence of 'Subversion' contrary to Article 22 of the HKNSL. Thus, Police applied to the court for arrest warrants in accordance with the law and put the persons involved on wanted list. Any acts disregarding the facts and smearing HKSAR's work in safeguarding national security with untruthful remarks are hypocritical and irresponsible, and will not win any public support.""

""We have to stress that both the HKNSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press and of publication, and the freedoms of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applicable to the HKSAR are protected in accordance with the law. However, regarding an extremely small minority of organisations and individuals endangering national security, the HKSAR Government will not condone their criminal acts, and will not give up pursuing them, including adopting all practical measures to bring those fugitives endangering national security who have absconded from Hong Kong to justice.""

The spokesman emphasised, ""Absconders should not think they can evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong. Ultimately, they will be liable for their acts constituting serious offences endangering national security and be punished by the law. No country or organisation should harbour criminals nor try to exonerate these people with different excuses.""

""The Constitution and the Basic Law steadfastly safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people. Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail. The HKSAR Government will continue to unwaveringly discharge its duty in safeguarding national security,"" the spokesman reiterated."
特區政府反對抹黑警方依法執法行動言論,2025-07-27 16:30,2025-07-27 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700500.htm,"​特區政府今日（七月二十七日）強烈反對和不滿美國、加拿大、澳洲等地的官員政客、以及反華組織等歪曲事實，抹黑特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的行動。有關外國官員、政客及反華組織不但漠視該等不法分子的犯罪行為，更刻意抹黑特區政府依法採取的措施及行動，並發表不負責任言論，試圖混淆視聽，特區政府對此表示強烈不滿。

特區政府發言人表示：「危害國家安全的行為和活動會引起極其嚴重的後果，必須及時採取行動，有效防範和制止。根據《香港國安法》第三十七條，《香港國安法》適用於在特區以外地方干犯《香港國安法》下罪行的特區永久性居民，及在特區成立的公司及團體等法人及非法人組織。此外，《香港國安法》第三十八條訂明，《香港國安法》亦適用於不具有香港特區永久性居民身份但針對特區實施犯罪的人。因此，香港警方有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》罪行的人。」

「『香港議會』是一個旨在顛覆國家政權的組織，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定所謂『香港憲法』，以非法手段推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等，涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》第二十二條『顛覆國家政權罪』，警方遂依法向法院申請拘捕令，並通緝有關人士。任何妄顧事實而以失實言論抹黑香港特區維護國家安全工作的都是偽善和不負責任的行為，不得人心。」

「我們必須強調，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威等自由。不過，針對極少部分危害國家安全的組織和個人，特區政府對其犯罪行為絕不姑息，一定追究到底，並採取一切可行方法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全的人士。」

發言人強調：「潛逃者不要妄想潛逃離港就可以逃避刑責。他們最終都需要為其危害國家安全的嚴重犯罪行為負上責任，受到法律制裁。任何國家或組織亦不應包庇犯罪分子，或以不同藉口嘗試為這些人開脫。」

發言人重申：「香港居民的人權和自由受《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實保障。任何外國或外部勢力企圖詆毀香港情況，只會理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，維護國家安全。」"

凌晨四時四十五分，警方接獲報案，指一名男子倒臥在關門口街對開，懷疑他從高處墮下。

初步調查顯示，該名男子懷疑於該酒店房間內以一把刀襲擊另外三名死者。

警方在該房間內檢獲一把約二十四厘米長的廚房刀，懷疑與案有關。

警方稍後將安排驗屍，以確定死者死因。

荃灣警區重案組第二隊正積極調查案件。"

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-27 10:50,2025-07-27 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700274.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-27 06:46,2025-07-27 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700019.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 27) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."
天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-07-27 06:45,2025-07-27 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700018.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十七日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

市民可透過以下途徑，取得更多資料：衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111）、中暑專頁、紫外線專頁；天文台「打電話問天氣」（1878 200）、最新天氣報告及預報、紫外線指​數、遠足及攀山天氣資訊；及勞工處於工作暑熱警告生效期間，對戶外工作的僱員和其僱主發布有關預防中暑措施的新聞公報。"
