For those with financial difficulties, the LD will assist them to apply for appropriate emergency funds. Subject to the needs and wishes of family members of the deceased, the LD will also liaise with the Social Welfare Department for financial or other assistance.

 For the sake of securing the safety and health of employees at work, the LD appeals to employers to provide plant and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health. Employees should co-operate with their employers, adopt all safety measures and use personal protective equipment provided properly to avoid endangering their own work safety and that of other workers."

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-07-28 16:08,2025-07-28 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800527.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on July 25 to noon today (July 28), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 368 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

All the samples passed the tests."
Number of service points for Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme in Guangzhou increases to four,2025-07-28 16:03,2025-07-28 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800266.htm,"The Government announced today (July 28) that the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (GPHCM) in Guangzhou will accept eligible Hong Kong elderly persons to use Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs) to pay for outpatient healthcare services at designated departments starting from July 31.

""The GPHCM is the fourth service point in Guangzhou and the second Chinese medicine hospital under the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme (Pilot Scheme), providing eligible elderly persons with additional choices in healthcare services. In January 2024, the GPHCM and the Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement to promote talent exchange and scientific research collaboration, etc. The GPHCM has been an invaluable partner to Hong Kong in promoting the high-quality development of Chinese medicine,"" said a Government spokesman. With this additional service point, the number of service points in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) Mainland cities where EHCVs can be used will increase to 16, benefitting more than 1.78 million eligible Hong Kong elderly persons. Apart from the GPHCM, the other three service points in Guangzhou are The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University; Nansha Division of the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, and Guangdong Clifford Hospital.

At the GPHCM, EHCVs are applicable for outpatient healthcare services provided by 10 designated departments, namely the Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Surgery, Department of Ophthalmology, Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck, Department of Stomatology, Department of Orthopedics, Department of Gynecology, Department of Dermatology, Department of Breast, and Department of Acupuncture.

The arrangements for shared use of EHCVs between spouses and the EHCV Pilot Reward Scheme under the EHCV Scheme are equally applicable to the GPHCM. When an elderly person receives designated primary healthcare outpatient services for health checks, preventive health services, and follow-up/monitoring of long-term conditions at the designated departments, the EHCV spending for that service encounter can be accumulated for the allotment of rewards. Further information and patient visit procedures are set out in the Annex.

The fees for the healthcare services provided by the pilot medical institutions are denominated in Renminbi. Medical institutions will make EHCV claims for elderly persons, and the EHCV amount deducted in Hong Kong dollars will be calculated according to a monthly updated voucher conversion factor under the EHCV Scheme. The monthly voucher conversion factor under the EHCV Scheme will be displayed at the cashier offices of the medical institutions for reference by the elderly persons.

""Elderly persons cannot use EHCVs together with national medical insurance to pay for the fees of the same healthcare service encounter. The scope of using EHCVs on the Mainland is the same as that in Hong Kong, which does not include inpatient services, prepaid healthcare services and day surgery procedures. EHCVs cannot be used solely for the purchase of goods, medication, medical equipment or products, nor can they be redeemed for cash,"" the spokesman reminded.

Hong Kong elderly persons should register with eHealth before using EHCVs at any designated service point in the GBA. To facilitate Hong Kong citizens in using electronic health records (eHRs) across the boundary in a secure manner and to enhance the continuity of healthcare services, the ""Cross-boundary Health Record"" and ""Personal Folder"" functions of the eHealth mobile application (eHealth App) will be extended to the GPHCM starting from the service launch day of the Pilot Scheme (i.e. July 31). In addition, elderly persons can also use the eHealth App to check their EHCV balance and usage record, as well as access at any time important information such as their medications, allergies and adverse drug reactions stored in the eHealth App. If elderly persons wish to use EHCVs at the GBA medical institutions but have not yet registered with eHealth, the medical institutions will instantly register them for eHealth upon their consent so that they can use EHCVs right away.

If elderly persons suspect that the participating medical institutions have violated the EHCV Scheme rules, they can call the EHCV Scheme hotline (2838 2311) to provide relevant information and details to the Health Care Voucher Division of the Department of Health (DH). All suspected cases of violation of the EHCV Scheme rules will be strictly dealt with by the DH. Furthermore, each participating GBA medical institution has set up an enquiry and complaint hotline. Elderly persons can also offer their views to the relevant medical institution or file complaints against the medical institutions under the Pilot Scheme to the health authority at the provincial or city level if necessary. Members of the public can visit the following thematic website (www.hcv.gov.hk/en/hcv_gba_pilot_scheme/index.html) for more information.

The Government is actively taking forward the implementation of the Pilot Scheme in the remaining five medical institutions included in the Pilot Scheme. It is expected that the relevant arrangements will be launched gradually in the second half of this year. Together with the two service points operated by the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, eligible elderly persons can use EHCVs at a total of 21 service points in the GBA Mainland cities."
「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」在廣州市服務點增至四個,2025-07-28 16:00,2025-07-28 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800264.htm,"政府今日（七月二十八日）公布，位於廣州市的廣東省中醫院將於七月三十一日起接受合資格香港長者使用長者醫療券（醫療券）支付指定科室的門診醫療護理服務費用。

政府發言人表示：「廣東省中醫院是『長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃』（『試點計劃』）下廣州市內第四個服務點，亦是第二間開展服務的中醫院，為合資格長者提供更多醫療服務選擇。該院於二○二四年一月與香港中醫醫院簽署戰略合作協議，以促進人才交流及科研協作等，一直是香港推動中醫藥高質量發展的重要合作夥伴。」計及這個新增的服務點，大灣區內地城市可以使用醫療券的服務點將增至16個，讓超過178萬名合資格的香港長者受惠。除了廣東省中醫院外，廣州市另外三個服務點為－－中山大學附屬第一醫院、中山大學附屬第一醫院南沙院區，及廣東祈福醫院。

在廣東省中醫院，醫療券將適用於其10個指定科室的門診醫療護理服務，包括內科、外科、眼科、耳鼻咽喉頭頸科、口腔科、骨科、婦科、皮膚科、乳腺科及針推康復。

醫療券計劃下的配偶共用醫療券安排和「長者醫療券獎賞先導計劃」同樣適用於廣東省中醫院。長者使用醫療券在指定科室接受健康檢查、預防疾病、跟進／監測慢性疾病門診服務等特定基層醫療服務，該次服務所使用的醫療券金額可累積計算以賺取獎賞。更多的資料及就醫流程列於附件。

試點醫療機構的醫療服務收費以人民幣結算。醫療機構會為長者申報使用醫療券，並按醫療券計劃下每月更新的換算率計算需扣除的港元醫療券金額。醫療機構會於收費處標示計劃下每月的指明換算率，供長者參考。

發言人提醒：「長者不可同時使用醫療券和國家醫療保險支付同一次醫療服務的費用。在內地使用醫療券的適用範圍跟在香港一樣，不包括住院服務、須預先繳費的醫療服務及日間手術程序。醫療券亦不可用於單純購買物品、藥物、醫療儀器和用品，更不可兌換現金。」

香港長者在任何一個大灣區服務點使用醫療券，均須先登記加入醫健通。醫健通流動應用程式中的「跨境健康紀錄」及「個人資料夾」功能，亦將於「試點計劃」服務開展當日（七月三十一日）起擴展至廣東省中醫院，便利香港市民安全地跨境使用電子健康紀錄，以獲取更連貫的護理服務。此外，長者亦可利用醫健通流動應用程式查閱醫療券餘額和使用紀錄，以及隨時取覽儲存至醫健通的個人藥物紀錄、敏感及藥物不良反應等重要資料。如長者欲於大灣區的指定醫療機構使用醫療券，但尚未加入醫健通，醫療機構在取得長者同意後，會即時為長者登記醫健通，以便長者可隨即使用醫療券。

長者如懷疑參與計劃的醫療機構違反醫療券計劃的規定，可致電醫療券計劃熱線（2838 2311）向衞生署醫療券事務科提供相關資料及詳情。衞生署會嚴肅跟進所有懷疑違反醫療券計劃規定的個案。此外，每間大灣區試點醫療機構均設有查詢或投訴熱線。長者亦可向相關醫療機構提出意見，或在有需要時向省或市級衞生當局就「試點計劃」醫療機構作出投訴。市民可參閱以下專題網頁了解更多資料（www.hcv.gov.hk/tc/hcv_gba_pilot_scheme/index.html）。

政府正積極與餘下五間獲納入「試點計劃」的醫療機構推進準備工作，預計相關的醫療機構可於今年下半年內陸續開展相關安排，連同香港大學深圳醫院的一院兩點，合資格長者可以在大灣區內地城市合共21個服務點使用醫療券。"

多謝主席、各位委員。

建設低碳綠色宜居的城市是世界大趨勢，國家二十大報告也表明要堅持「綠水青山就是金山銀山」的理念，推動綠色發展，所以香港特區也應該朝着建設低碳綠色宜居社區的方向來規劃發展，以滿足未來社會、環境及經濟的需要和期望。

我們認為一個低碳綠色宜居的社區需要最少具備智慧、綠色及具抗禦力等三個元素，透過穩健的城市規劃、創新及科技應用、明智運用資源、有生命力的企業，以及綠色低碳生活文化，達致人與自然和諧共生的可持續社區。

政府在過去已就規劃低碳綠色宜居社區累積了豐富的經驗，例如在洪水橋／厦村新發展區在城市規劃、城市設計和綠色基建等各方面引入了可持續發展及以人為本的策略，以提高效率、節約能源、增加廢物循環再用和綠化面積，以及減少碳排放。

總結以往經驗，環境及生態局聯同發展局正計劃制訂《規劃新發展區的通用綠色框架》，為政策局及部門就規劃新發展區時提供指引。本文件旨在介紹政府就制訂《綠色框架》的初步構想，並徵詢委員的意見，以集思廣益，再為《綠色框架》作草擬及定稿。

接下來我請同事簡介文件的內容。"

Given the sudden change of events and the absence of the Deputy Financial Secretary from Hong Kong, the Government has decided that the post of Secretary for Housing will be taken up by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, MrCheuk Wing-hing, for those three days.

To enhance governance of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, the current-term Government created three Deputy Secretaries of Departments to strengthen co-ordination of work across bureaux.

醫務衞生局（醫衞局）局長盧寵茂教授今日（七月二十八日）表示：「雙軌發展途徑是突破香港公共醫療機構及醫學院既有聘用安排的新措施，為從事醫教研工作的複合型專才提供更適切的專業發展途徑，度身訂造與其工作性質相稱的聘任和臨床工作安排，以及晉升階梯。同時，亦為他們的教研工作提供更多支援，包括授予大學教授頭銜。有關安排體現了醫管局和本地兩所醫學院為培訓及挽留醫教研人才攜手合作，突破制度的條框。」

「醫生的臨床工作與教學和研究密不可分。臨床工作所提供的數據和經驗是醫學研究的重要基礎，而最新的研究成果應用於臨床實踐亦可進一步提升臨床服務的質與量，兩者相輔相成。我期望雙軌發展途徑能讓更多有志參與醫教研工作的醫生實現抱負，在為病患提供臨床服務的同時，亦為香港醫療研究和創新貢獻力量。」

他續指：「建立雙軌發展途徑為培育臨床教研人才締造更有利環境， 配合醫衞局近年推出的多項醫療制度改革措施，包括籌備成立『香港藥物及器械監管中心』、設立『粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所』、推動臨床試驗及籌建第三所醫學院等，以鞏固香港作為國際醫療創新樞紐的地位。我亦期望新措施可吸引更多有志從事臨床研究和創新工作的非本地培訓醫生落戶香港，進一步壯大醫療人才庫，讓市民受惠。」

醫管局與兩所醫學院已開始逐步推展相關聘任工作，目前已有五位醫生經甄選正式參與雙軌發展途徑。當中四位來自香港兒童醫院的醫生已獲香港大學醫學院委任，專注於多種疾病的研究與治療，涵蓋兒童惡性腫瘤、造血幹細胞移植、新生兒深切治療、兒童性發育差異、年輕人心源性猝死和心血管病、小兒血液學和腫瘤學等，以及模擬學習與技能培訓的發展。另一位來自新界東醫院聯網深切治療科的醫生則獲香港中文大學醫學院委任，專注於痛症管理與深切治療的診治、研究及專業培訓工作。另外，多位來自新界東醫院聯網的醫生預計將於今年內透過雙軌發展途徑，加入香港中文大學醫學院，進一步擴大教學與臨床融合的人才庫。"

Under this pathway, doctors aspiring to engage in medical, teaching and research work would hold positions at both the HA and the designated university, and could flexibly allocate their time between clinical services, teaching and research work as needed.

  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, said today (July 28), ""The dual-track development pathway is a new initiative that goes beyond the existing employment arrangements in Hong Kong's public healthcare institutions and medical schools. It provides a more fitting professional development pathway for composite talent engaged in medical, teaching and research work, with tailor-made appointment and clinical work arrangements and a promotion ladder commensurate with the nature of their work. It also provides stronger support for their teaching and research duties, including conferring the title of university professor. This arrangement signifies a breakthrough of institutional framework through collaboration between the HA and the two local medical schools to train and retain medical, teaching and research talent.

  ""A doctor's clinical work is inextricably linked with teaching and research. The data and experience from clinical work are an important foundation for medical research, while the clinical application of the latest research results can further enhance the quality and quantity of clinical services. The two are complementary. I hope that the dual-track development pathway will enable more doctors who aspire to engage in medical, teaching and research work to realise their ambitions and contribute to Hong Kong's medical innovation and research while providing clinical services to patients.""

  He continued, ""The establishment of a dual-track development pathway creates a more favourable environment for nurturing clinical, teaching and research talent. This complements the various reforms within our healthcare system put forward by the HHB in recent years, including preparing for the establishment of the 'Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation', setting up the 'Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute', promoting clinical trials, and planning for the establishment of a third medical school. All these initiatives will consolidate Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub. I also hope this new measure will attract more non-locally trained doctors who are interested in clinical research and innovation to come to Hong Kong, to further strengthen the medical talent pool for the benefit of the public.""

  The HA and the two medical schools have started the relevant recruitment work progressively. To date, five doctors have been officially selected to participate in the dual-track development pathway. Among them, four doctors from the Hong Kong Children's Hospital were appointed by the medical school of HKU, focusing on the research and treatment of various diseases covering paediatric malignant tumours, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, neonatal intensive care, differences in sex development in children, sudden cardiac death and cardiovascular disease in the young, paediatric hematology and oncology, and the development of simulation-based learning and skills training. Another doctor from the Department of Intensive Care of the New Territories East Cluster was appointed by the medical school of CUHK, focusing on the diagnosis, treatment, research and professional training in pain management and intensive care. Furthermore, various doctors from the New Territories East Cluster are expected to join the medical school of CUHK through the dual-track development pathway within this year, further expanding the talent pool for the integration of teaching and clinical work."

響應「世界肝炎日」　乙肝「早驗早處理」,2025-07-28 12:10,2025-07-28 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800298.htm,"衞生署今日（七月二十八日）表示，經過政府三十多年來的推動和努力，香港乙型肝炎（乙肝）感染率已大幅降低，並逐步邁向「無乙肝新一代」的目標。

每年七月二十八日為「世界肝炎日」，衞生署今年特別以「廿分之一係咪你乙肝早驗早處理」為口號，提醒市民若不確定是否患有慢性乙型肝炎，應及早進行測試。早發現、早治療可有效減低乙肝所引發的嚴重肝臟疾病的風險。

衞生署衞生防護中心公共衞生服務處特別預防計劃顧問醫生黃駿君醫生表示：「香港於七○年代的乙肝感染率高逾10%，自八○年代起，政府採取多項有效免費預防措施，包括為所有孕婦進行乙肝篩查、為患有乙肝的孕婦所生的嬰兒注射乙肝免疫球蛋白、自一九八八年起為所有新生嬰兒接種乙肝疫苗、近年增設向患有乙肝且病毒量高的孕婦提供抗病毒藥物，以及為母親是乙肝患者的嬰兒在接種乙肝疫苗後安排血清測試。現時，35歲以下年齡組別的乙肝感染率已少於1%，香港正邁向『無乙肝新一代』的目標。」

乙型肝炎可分急性或慢性，嚴重情況會引發肝衰竭、肝硬化或肝癌。衞生署根據2020-22年度人口健康調查的結果推算，全港整體人口仍有約5.6%（即約41萬人）患有慢性乙肝。調查發現35至84歲人士的乙肝感染率明顯較高，達7.8%，主要原因是於一九八八年前出生，未受惠於普及兒童乙肝疫苗接種計劃。調查亦發現，近四成患者沒有察覺自己患有慢性乙肝，並有約七成患者沒有接受任何跟進治療。慢性乙肝是一種終身感染，可以潛藏數以十年也不引起任何症狀，若沒有接受治療，約15%至40%的患者長遠會出現肝硬化和肝癌等嚴重肝臟疾病。肝癌是本港第三位致命癌症，每年約1 400人死於肝癌；而約八成肝癌新症患者患有慢性乙肝。

衞生署藉「世界肝炎日」呼籲所有香港市民關注慢性乙肝這個可以導致肝硬化及肝癌的「幕後黑手」。市民如不確定是否乙肝患者，特別是較高感染風險人士，例如不曾接種疫苗者、家庭成員（如父母、兄弟姊妹及子女）或性伴侶為慢性乙肝患者等，應及早進行測試，了解自己的身體狀況，並採取適切預防措施，包括接種乙肝疫苗。

乙肝測試除透過傳統靜脈抽血化驗外，現時亦可透過指尖採血快速測試，於15至30分鐘內獲得結果。乙肝測試於不同醫療機構均有提供，個別機構更設有流動檢測服務。市民如欲進行乙肝測試，可諮詢家庭醫生了解詳情及收費。

如確診患有慢性乙肝，應諮詢醫生的建議並定期接受跟進和檢查，以實踐「早驗早處理」。現今治療乙肝的抗病毒藥物能有效抑制病毒的複製，大大減低患者出現肝硬化和肝癌等併發症的風險。

另外，二○二四年《施政報告》提出在社區推行以風險為本的乙肝篩查，及早識別在社區的患者，並提供持續管理。基層醫療署正研究相關安排，詳情將適時公布。此外，政府今年內將公布《2025-2030年香港病毒性肝炎行動計劃》，制訂措施以進一步減輕病毒性肝炎的公共衞生負擔。

為加強公眾及醫護人員對肝炎風險的認知，衞生署和社區夥伴分別推出多項宣傳活動，以期將信息滲透不同人口群組，包括：

透過多元渠道宣傳健康資訊，例如報章專欄、電台訪談及社交媒體等；
於地區康健中心舉辦線上及實體健康講座；
於全港多區舉行流動健康推廣展覽；以及
由非政府組織（包括亞洲肝炎會、香港乙肝基金會、香港肝壽基金及香港肝臟移植協康會等）舉辦社區公眾教育活動，向市民講解乙型肝炎防治知識，提供快速測試及風險評估等服務。

DH appeals for early testing and management of hepatitis B in support of World Hepatitis Day,2025-07-28 12:10,2025-07-28 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800288.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (July 28) said that with the Government's promulgation and efforts over the past three decades, the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Hong Kong has been significantly reduced and is moving progressively towards the goal of a ""hepatitis B-free generation"".

World Hepatitis Day is designated on July 28 every year. This year, the DH has adopted the slogan ""1 in 20: Test and Manage Hep B Early"" to remind members of the public to undergo testing early if they are uncertain whether they are having chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Early identification and management can effectively lower the risk of serious liver diseases caused by CHB.

  ""The prevalence of HBV infection in Hong Kong was over 10 per cent in the 1970s. Since the 1980s, the Government has implemented various effective and free preventive measures, including universal antenatal screening for hepatitis B, administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin for babies born to mothers with hepatitis B, universal neonatal hepatitis B vaccination since 1988, use of antivirals for pregnant women with CHB and high viral load, and post-vaccination serologic testing arranged for babies born to mothers with hepatitis B in recent years. Currently, the prevalence of HBV infection is less than 1 per cent among those under 35 years old. Hong Kong is moving towards the goal of a 'hepatitis B-free generation'"", said the Consultant (Special Preventive Programme) of the Public Health Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Bonnie Wong.

Hepatitis B infection can be acute or chronic. Severe cases of hepatitis B infection can lead to liver failure, cirrhosis or liver cancer. As derived from the findings of the Population Health Survey (PHS) 2020-22 conducted by the DH, about 5.6 per cent (about 410 000 people) of the Hong Kong population have CHB. The survey found that the prevalence of HBV infection among participants aged 35 to 84 was significantly higher at 7.8 per cent, mainly because those born before 1988 had not benefited from the universal childhood hepatitis B immunisation programme. The survey also found that nearly 40 per cent of people with CHB were not aware of their conditions and about 70 per cent of people with CHB did not receive any medical follow-up. CHB is a lifelong infection that often shows no symptoms for decades. Without treatment, about 15 to 40 per cent of the patients with CHB may develop serious liver diseases like cirrhosis or liver cancer in the long run. Liver cancer is Hong Kong's third leading cause of cancer deaths, which claimed around 1 400 lives every year. About 80 per cent of primary liver cancer patients have CHB.

The DH, in support of World Hepatitis Day, urges members of the public in Hong Kong to pay attention to CHB, which is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. People who are not sure whether they have CHB, especially those at higher risk of infection, such as those who have not received vaccination, or whose family members (including parents, siblings and offspring) or sexual partners have CHB, are advised to undergo early testing to review their health condition and take appropriate preventive measures, including receiving hepatitis B vaccination.

Apart from the traditional venous blood sampling, rapid test for hepatitis B using blood drop from a finger-prick is also available and the result will be available in 15 to 30 minutes. Hepatitis B testing is available at different healthcare organisations, and some even offer mobile testing services. Members of the public may consult their family doctors for details and the charges if they wish to have hepatitis B testing.

If you are diagnosed with CHB, in line with the principle of ""test and manage early"", you should consult your doctor for advice and receive regular follow-ups and examinations. Current antiviral medications for hepatitis B can inhibit virus replication effectively and thereby greatly reduce the risk of complications such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Separately, the 2024 Policy Address announced a risk-based hepatitis B screening in the community for early identification of people with CHB in the community, and to provide subsequent management. The Primary Healthcare Commission is exploring the relevant arrangement and details will be announced in due course. In addition, the Government will announce the Hong Kong Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2025-2030 within this year, to promulgate measures to further alleviate the public health burden of viral hepatitis.

To raise the public and healthcare workers' awareness of the risk of hepatitis, the DH and community partners have respectively launched a number of publicity campaigns to disseminate the messages to different population groups, including:

promoting health information through multiple channels, such as newspaper columns, radio interviews and social media;
organising online and physical health seminars in District Health Centres;
organising roving exhibitions on health promotions in various districts across the territory; and
organising community public education activities by non-governmental organisations (including Asiahep Hong Kong Limited, Hong Kong Hepatitis B Free Foundation, the Hong Kong Liver Foundation and the Hong Kong Liver Transplant Patients' Association) to educate the public on the prevention of hepatitis B, and provide services such as rapid testing and risk assessment.

  The TD has approved the taxi livery design and markings of the four fleets. For easy identification by passengers, all fleet taxis are required to display fleet taxi plates at the front and rear of the taxi bodies, and a fleet taxi certificate on the windscreens of the taxis.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""All fleets provide online hailing services. Passengers can book their journeys through the fleets' mobile applications or other online hailing channels. Fleets also provide customer service hotlines to handle passengers' enquiries and complaints. Further, all fleet taxis provide multiple electronic payment means, while safety devices including dash cameras, in-vehicle cameras and global navigation satellite systems as well as the driver monitoring system have been installed to provide convenience for passengers and ensure driving safety.""

  Fleet taxis may customise fares for pre-arranged journeys, charging a booking fee on top of the metered fare or charging a lump sum fare before the journey starts. Both must be agreed upon with the hirer in advance. The fares of fleet taxis may vary for pre-arranged journeys depending on the circumstances at the time of booking and the types of taxis requested by the passenger. For example, higher fares may be charged during peak hours or when the passenger requests a premium taxi. For street-hailing trips, fleet taxis shall charge according to the same fare schedule as general taxis.

  The TD has set up a taxi fleet thematic website. It also introduces information about the taxi fleet service to the public and tourists through various online and offline channels, including the TD's HKeMobility mobile application, and collaboration with the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Airport Authority Hong Kong, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal operator and Hong Kong Talent Engage.

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-28 11:30,2025-07-28 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800283.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference.

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-28 06:45,2025-07-28 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800013.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 28) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."
天氣酷熱　衞生署提醒市民預防高溫引發的疾病,2025-07-28 06:45,2025-07-28 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/28/P2025072800015.htm,"天氣酷熱，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（七月二十八日）提醒市民，應採取適當措施預防高溫引發的疾病，例如熱痙攣、熱衰竭和中暑。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

市民可透過以下途徑，取得更多資料：衞生署健康教育專線（2833 0111）、中暑專頁、紫外線專頁；天文台「打電話問天氣」（1878 200）、最新天氣報告及預報、紫外線指​數、遠足及攀山天氣資訊；及勞工處於工作暑熱警告生效期間，對戶外工作的僱員和其僱主發布有關預防中暑措施的新聞公報。"

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) has the following statement today (July 27) regarding an industrial accident at Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) redevelopment project construction site:

The redevelopment project of QMH is being carried out by the Architectural Services Department (ArchSD). This afternoon, the HA was notified by the ArchSD that a worker employed by a lift engineering subcontractor was trapped in one of the lift shafts during work. The site management of the contractor immediately called Fire Services Department to rescue the worker, who was then sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of QMH for emergency treatment. The worker was certified dead upon arrival at the Accident and Emergency Department.

The HA expresses deep sorrow over this incident and extends its sincere condolences to the deceased worker's family. The HA has directed the ArchSD to ensure that the contractor provides appropriate assistance to the family and supports them in handling the family member's after-death arrangements.

The HA is very concerned about the incident. Since the lifts involved in the project have not yet undergone all required works and adjustments, and have not been handed over for use and management by QMH. The HA is aware that site staff from the ArchSD immediately contacted and followed up with the contractor after the accident. The contractor has been urged to take the incident seriously and to adopt all necessary measures as soon as possible to ensure site safety. The contractor has also been requested to thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident and to submit a report to the ArchSD and the HA as soon as possible to prevent similar accidents from happening again.

The HA has always placed paramount importance on industrial safety at hospital construction sites.

HKSAR Government opposes smears against Police lawful enforcement actions,2025-07-27 16:46,2025-07-27 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700516.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (July 27) strongly opposed and disapproved of smears with distorted facts by government officials and politicians from countries like the United States, Canada and Australia, as well as anti-China organisations, on HKSAR's lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong. Not only did such foreign government officials and politicians, as well as anti-China organisations, turned a blind eye to illegal acts of criminals, but also deliberately smeared and spread irresponsible remarks, in an attempt to mislead the public, about the measures and actions taken by the HKSAR Government in accordance with the law. The HKSAR Government strongly disapproved of such acts.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""Acts and activities endangering national security could bring very serious consequences. Prompt actions must be taken to prevent and suppress such acts and activities effectively. According to Article 37 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL), this Law shall apply to a person who is a permanent resident of the HKSAR or an incorporated or unincorporated body such as a company or an organisation which is set up in the HKSAR if the person or the body commits an offence under the HKNSL outside the HKSAR. Additionally, Article 38 of the HKNSL stipulates that this Law shall apply to offences under this Law committed against the HSKAR from outside the HKSAR by a person who is not a permanent resident of the HKSAR. Therefore, the Hong Kong Police Force has the responsibility to pursue, in accordance with the law, persons suspected of committing offences under the HKNSL outside Hong Kong.""

""The 'Hong Kong Parliament' is an organisation which aims to subvert state power; its objectives include promoting 'self-determination', promulgating the so-called 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of People's Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR with unlawful means, thereby suspected of having committed the offence of 'Subversion' contrary to Article 22 of the HKNSL. Thus, Police applied to the court for arrest warrants in accordance with the law and put the persons involved on wanted list. Any acts disregarding the facts and smearing HKSAR's work in safeguarding national security with untruthful remarks are hypocritical and irresponsible, and will not win any public support.""

""We have to stress that both the HKNSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press and of publication, and the freedoms of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applicable to the HKSAR are protected in accordance with the law. However, regarding an extremely small minority of organisations and individuals endangering national security, the HKSAR Government will not condone their criminal acts, and will not give up pursuing them, including adopting all practical measures to bring those fugitives endangering national security who have absconded from Hong Kong to justice.""

The spokesman emphasised, ""Absconders should not think they can evade criminal liability by absconding from Hong Kong. Ultimately, they will be liable for their acts constituting serious offences endangering national security and be punished by the law. No country or organisation should harbour criminals nor try to exonerate these people with different excuses.""

""The Constitution and the Basic Law steadfastly safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people. Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's situation will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail. The HKSAR Government will continue to unwaveringly discharge its duty in safeguarding national security,"" the spokesman reiterated."
特區政府反對抹黑警方依法執法行動言論,2025-07-27 16:30,2025-07-27 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700500.htm,"​特區政府今日（七月二十七日）強烈反對和不滿美國、加拿大、澳洲等地的官員政客、以及反華組織等歪曲事實，抹黑特區依法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全分子的行動。有關外國官員、政客及反華組織不但漠視該等不法分子的犯罪行為，更刻意抹黑特區政府依法採取的措施及行動，並發表不負責任言論，試圖混淆視聽，特區政府對此表示強烈不滿。

特區政府發言人表示：「危害國家安全的行為和活動會引起極其嚴重的後果，必須及時採取行動，有效防範和制止。根據《香港國安法》第三十七條，《香港國安法》適用於在特區以外地方干犯《香港國安法》下罪行的特區永久性居民，及在特區成立的公司及團體等法人及非法人組織。此外，《香港國安法》第三十八條訂明，《香港國安法》亦適用於不具有香港特區永久性居民身份但針對特區實施犯罪的人。因此，香港警方有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》罪行的人。」

「『香港議會』是一個旨在顛覆國家政權的組織，其目標包括推動『自決』、制定所謂『香港憲法』，以非法手段推翻、破壞《中華人民共和國憲法》所確立的中華人民共和國根本制度或推翻中華人民共和國中央政權機關或者特區政權機關等，涉嫌干犯《香港國安法》第二十二條『顛覆國家政權罪』，警方遂依法向法院申請拘捕令，並通緝有關人士。任何妄顧事實而以失實言論抹黑香港特區維護國家安全工作的都是偽善和不負責任的行為，不得人心。」

「我們必須強調，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》，以及《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區的有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威等自由。不過，針對極少部分危害國家安全的組織和個人，特區政府對其犯罪行為絕不姑息，一定追究到底，並採取一切可行方法緝捕潛逃境外危害國家安全的人士。」

發言人強調：「潛逃者不要妄想潛逃離港就可以逃避刑責。他們最終都需要為其危害國家安全的嚴重犯罪行為負上責任，受到法律制裁。任何國家或組織亦不應包庇犯罪分子，或以不同藉口嘗試為這些人開脫。」

發言人重申：「香港居民的人權和自由受《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實保障。任何外國或外部勢力企圖詆毀香港情況，只會理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，維護國家安全。」"
