黃曉君主席（博愛醫院董事局主席）、黃浩明議員（立法會議員、恒基兆業地產有限公司執行董事）、各位嘉賓、各位跑手、各位朋友：

大家早晨！今日我很開心出席「恒基x博愛中環海濱慈善跑2026」起步禮，為各位跑手打氣。連續兩個星期日早上我都為跑步賽事主持起步禮，可見香港市民的運動細胞的確十分強！

「慈善跑」是博愛醫院的重點籌款項目，今年再度獲恒基兆業地產冠名贊助，體現「寓運動於慈善」的理念。今年賽事還增設輪椅體驗組，實踐傷健共融的精神。我相信參加者為公益而賽，過程中必定跑得更加起勁。

今屆活動所籌得的善款，除了用於興建博愛醫院屯門藍地長者護理及護養安老院舍外，還會撥款支持大埔火災重建及支援項目，真真正正惠及社會上不同需要的人士。

賽事路線途經中環心臟地帶多個景點和地標，包括大家目前身處的中環海濱賽道，是港島海濱走廊其中一段最受歡迎的。隨着北角東岸板道東段於上月二十九日正式啓用後，海濱走廊已全線開通，長達約13公里，由堅尼地城貫通至筲箕灣，大家可盡覽維港的美麗風光。沿途設有共享徑、階梯式座位、遊樂空間、健身設施、釣魚平台等，滿足市民的不同需要。此外，沿途還設有人寵共享的行人專用路徑，讓主人與寵物能夠共同享受海濱設施，絕對是休閒和健身的好地方。我鼓勵大家充分利用這些新設施，積極運動，強健體魄，建立健康的生活方式。

踏入二○二六年，市民熱愛的長跑賽事相繼舉行，包括今日「恒基x博愛中環海濱慈善跑2026」以及剛於上周完成的年度盛事「渣打香港馬拉松2026」。隨後，一系列體育盛事亦會接踵而來，例如「浪琴香港國際馬術盛典2026」和「世界桌球大獎賽」等。希望這些精彩的項目能為巿民和旅客帶來更多歡樂和正能量。

最後，我祝願今日活動圓滿成功，各位參加者滿載而歸，享受做運動的樂趣。多謝大家！"

All LegCo Members strongly condemn the so-called resolution on Hong Kong passed by European Parliament,2026-01-25 01:57,2026-01-25 02:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/25/P2026012500058.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

All Members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) strongly condemn the European Parliament's so-called resolution on Hong Kong, which has maliciously slandered the Hong Kong National Security Law and the judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), blatantly interfered in China's internal affairs, and seriously violated the principles of international law.LegCo Members fully support the statements issued by the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong and the HKSAR Government, and firmly believe that the HKSAR Government will resolutely implement the national security laws, while protecting the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents under the ""one country, two systems"" principle.

The case of Lai Chee-ying involves serious criminal offences in violation of the national security law. The court conducted hearings strictly in accordance with the law, openly and fairly. The court's 855-page judgment and conviction verdict delivered in December last year was well-founded and well-reasoned. It fully demonstrates that the court has made its judgment in strict accordance with the law, free from any interference, and free of any political considerations.

Any suggestion that certain individuals should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.

LegCo Members reiterate that Hong Kong matters are purely China's internal affairs, and strongly demand the European Parliament and other foreign politicians to respect the principle of international law and stop any form of interference in Hong Kong matters and the internal affairs of China.  "

​近日，歐洲議會通過涉及香港的所謂決議，有關內容罔顧事實、顛倒黑白，對《香港國安法》及香港特別行政區（特區）司法肆意污衊，公然干預中國內政，嚴重違反國際法原則，就此，立法會全體議員表示強烈譴責。我們全力支持外交部駐港公署及特區政府發出的聲明，並深信特區政府必定能夠繼續堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保「一國兩制」實踐行穩致遠。

必須指出的是，黎智英案涉及嚴重違反國安法的刑事犯罪。法院嚴格依照法律，公開公正地進行審理，於去年十二月作出所有控罪罪成的判決，更頒下長達855頁的判辭，鉅細無遺地說明法庭對相關法律原則和證據的分析，以及裁定黎智英和三間被告公司有罪的理由。法庭的定罪裁決有理有節，充分展現法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出裁決，不受任何干涉。

正如特區政府發言人所指：香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。任何人違反法律，都必須依法追究。倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。

我們重申，香港事務乃中國內政，不容他國干預。我們強烈要求歐洲議會及其他國家和政客，必須切實遵守國際法原則及國際關係基本準則，停止再以任何方式干預香港事務和干涉中國內政。"

The CFS has found in its follow-up investigation that five samples, involving four batches which were among the 22 batches earlier announced and already recalled from the market, were tested positive for Cereulide produced by Bacillus cereus, ranging from 0.8 to 8.6 micrograms per kilogram of food.

Nestlé Hong Kong had already voluntarily stopped sales and removed from shelves the 22 affected batches (including the aforementioned four batches) of products, and has initiated a precautionary recall earlier.

According to Nestlé Hong Kong, as at January 19, about 96 000 cans of affected products have been recalled. The CFS and Nestlé Hong Kong have jointly followed up, as at today, 169 000 cans of suspected affected batches of infant and young children formula products were marked and sealed, including those kept in warehouse and those already recalled. An additional 16 suspected affected batches are currently en route to Hong Kong and will also be marked and sealed upon arrival.

From January 7 to 4pm yesterday (January 23), the FEHD received a total of 43 food complaints and enquiries suspected to be related to the infant and young children formula products, including one anonymous complaint without contact information. The CFS and the Environmental Hygiene Branch have promptly followed up on these cases, including contacting the parties concerned to obtain details and collecting samples for testing. In addition, the CFS has referred the cases to the health authority for follow-up.

The CFS has enhanced surveillance of the relevant powdered infant and young children formula. The CFS will continue to closely monitor the recall matters and remain fully committed to ensuring food safety. Follow up investigation is ongoing.

Bacillus cereus is commonly found in the environment. Unhygienic conditions in food processing and storage may give rise to its growth. Cereulide is a heat-stable toxin produced in food by some strains of Bacillus cereus. Consuming food contaminated with excessive Bacillus cereus or its heat-stable toxins may cause gastrointestinal upset such as vomiting and diarrhoea.

The spokesman urged members of the public not to let infants and young children consume the 22 affected batches of the products, and to seek medical treatment for infants or young children who felt unwell after taking the products concerned. The trade should also stop using or selling the affected batches of the products immediately.

The CFS has established a designated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/powdered_formula/index.html) to facilitate public access to more information."

由一月七日至昨日（一月二十三日）下午四時，食環署共接獲43宗懷疑涉及嬰幼兒配方奶粉產品的食物投訴和查詢，當中包括一宗並沒有提供聯絡資料的匿名投訴。食安中心及環境衞生部已即時跟進全部個案，包括聯絡當事人以了解詳情，並收取樣本作檢測。此外，食安中心已轉介這些個案予衞生部門作跟進。

食安中心早前加強在市面抽檢嬰幼兒配方奶粉，並會繼續密切監察有關回收事宜，全力保障食物安全。跟進調查工作仍然繼續。

蠟樣芽孢桿菌普遍存在於環境中。如製作或貯存食品的過程欠缺衞生，可引致該菌繁殖。致吐毒素是由一些蠟樣芽孢桿菌菌株在食物中產生的耐熱毒素。進食含過量蠟樣芽孢桿菌或其耐熱毒素的食物，可能引致腸胃不適，例如嘔吐及腹瀉。

發言人呼籲市民不要讓嬰幼兒食用該22個受影響批次的產品，如發覺嬰幼兒食用有關產品後不適，應盡快求醫。業界亦應立即停止使用或出售受影響批次產品。

食環署人員亦同時加強附近一帶的防鼠及滅鼠工作，包括視察店鋪附近的私人樓宇和其他店鋪，並向相關負責人進行衞生教育。署方人員亦在附近公眾地方加放毒鼠餌，及安排夜間防治鼠患流動隊針對性於深夜時段進行捕鼠，以提升控制鼠患工作的成效。

食環署會繼續密切監察新鮮糧食店的衞生情況，並會積極採取巡查及執管行動，以保障市民健康。"
FEHD ordered temporary closure of fresh provision shop in Kowloon City (with photo),2026-01-24 18:45,2026-01-24 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/24/P2026012400582.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (January 24) ordered the temporary closure of a fresh provision shop (FPS) in Kowloon City due to poor hygiene conditions and serious rodent infestation. The shop must rectify the problems before it can reopen.

The FPS is located at G/F, 48-50 Lok Shan Road, Kowloon. During the blitz operation last month, the FEHD found that pig carcasses were not properly handled at the shop and immediately initiated prosecution. The department continued to follow up and conduct inspections. In another blitz operation earlier this month, poor hygiene conditions and signs of rodents were identified, leading to another prosecution.

During the blitz inspection conducted this morning, live rodents were discovered inside the premises, resulting in a further prosecution. The FEHD believed that the premises were in poor hygiene and seriously infested with rodents. To protect public health, the FEHD has ordered immediate closure of the FPS under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance. The FPS must immediately cease operation, carry out thorough cleansing and rodent control, and will only be allowed to reopen once the FEHD is satisfied with its hygiene condition.

The FEHD officers have also stepped up rodent prevention and control efforts in the surrounding areas, including inspecting private buildings and other shops nearby, and providing health education to responsible persons. Officers have also placed poisonous baits in nearby public areas and deployed overnight rodent control roving teams to conduct targeted rodent-catching operations at late night, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the rodent control efforts.

The FEHD will continue to closely monitor the hygiene conditions of the FPS and will actively carry out inspections and enforcement actions to safeguard public health."

最新監測數據
——————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-24 17:30,2026-01-24 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/24/P2026012400523.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 24), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

About 300 school representatives, parents, students, and members of the public attended the event, creating a fun-filled atmosphere.

Speaking at the ceremony, the Under Secretary for Education, Dr Sze Chun-fai, said that the EDB launched the Positive Parent Campaign in 2020 to promote to parents and the public the proper ways and attitudes of nurturing children through organising various activities. The theme of the Positive Parent Campaign this year is ""Family Resilience"", with the aims to remind parents of the importance of companionship and role modelling, encourage them to listen patiently to their children's needs with acceptance and openness, guide them in analysing problems, and thereby nurture the confidence and resilience their children need to face the future.

He noted that the competition had received an enthusiastic response, with over 1 200 entries submitted across four groups: kindergarten, primary, secondary and open groups. Through crafting free verses, parents and students shared messages about facing challenges positively, building resilience, and promoting mental well-being in a light-hearted and lively manner.

Earlier, the adjudication panel selected 20 outstanding entries from each group for public voting of The Most Liked Award, which recorded a total of over 10 000 votes across all four groups. All entries shortlisted for the finals were outstanding works filled with wisdom for everyday living and insight.

勞工及福利局局長就《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》和《僱傭條例》「連續性合約」新規定會見傳媒談話內容（只有中文）,2026-01-24 14:25,2026-01-24 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/24/P2026012400392.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（一月二十四日）上午出席香港理工大學「防跌路上同行有理」大行動成效與展望分享會後會見傳媒的談話內容：

勞工及福利局局長：歡迎大家今日來到「防跌路上同行有理」大行動成效與展望分享會，看看大家有甚麼問題？

記者：《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》已經實施了四日，想問至今有沒有收到一些確實的舉報，如果有的話大致舉報的內容是怎樣？會否有處分？

勞工及福利局局長：《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》（《條例》）在一月二十日正式實施，到今日應該是第四日。昨日我去了大埔區和同事聊天，了解到《條例》實施後是多了電話舉報，或者以不同途徑向我們反映懷疑虐兒個案。這個狀況是預料之內的，我們預計隨着《條例》的實施，大家會有更大的意願，以及法定責任，遇到懷疑個案就會舉報。這情況亦反映了隨着立法和過去一年半大量的宣傳工作，社會對於防止虐兒的意識是有很大提升。這數日舉報的數目明顯上升，我們覺得除了大家都自覺有責任外，亦反映了社會大眾對於防止虐兒的意識大大提升。但具體的數字要等一等，我們要先整理，然後一定會跟大家講解當中的變化，以及我們採取了甚麼行動。

記者：有關《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》，針對一些教育界人士擔心會不會做成教師或者前線人員可能會防衞式行事，未來政府會不會提供更加多的指引？另外，都知道合約工時已經改了做「468」（《僱傭條例》「連續性合約」新規定），現在實施的情況如何？有些工友反映被僱主削減工時，又或者有些公司短時間內更換「蛇頭公司」來逃避法律責任，政府對此有何回應？

勞工及福利局局長：《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》覆蓋了25類的專業，簡單來說就是三大行業，即社福、教育、醫療。在過去一年半的準備期，我們提供了大量培訓和網上資料予這25類的專業人士。另一個十分重要的就是《強制舉報者指南》（《指南》），《指南》也有一個電子版，即是說相關的人員，譬如以教育界為例，如果他覺得有所懷疑的話，其實最簡單應該要做的是瀏覽我們的電子「決策流程圖」，回答一些選擇題，回答後程式會跟他說明，根據程式計算以及他的答案，所涉個案是否屬於《條例》下需要強制舉報的狀況。

我覺得業界不需要擔心，大家都有培訓，而且最重要是秉持着保護兒童的心。《條例》不難遵從，過了最初的適應期後，我們很有信心相關的專業人員會知道自己應該怎樣去自處，然後就一起努力，我們編織一個更緊密的保護網去幫助兒童。

另外，關於「468」，「468」已經運行了一段短時間，在一月十八日正式實施，正如我在不同場合去解釋，由「418」轉去「468」最大的因由就是過往的「418」被很多工友投訴，他們有三個星期工時都長，然後有一個星期工時就很短，低於18小時，俗稱「斷纜」，沒有辦法變成長工。「468」最大的功效是令到這類情況不會再出現，因為我們是四個星期合計，只要超過68小時就屬於長工。當然有些僱主如果仍然希望用一個短工的形式去聘請員工，只要按照法例去做，他確實有這樣的選擇權，但對僱主來說，我覺得這樣做都未必是很明智。因為第一，如果他需要這麼多員工的話，意味着他要聘請多些員工，如果因而流失了一些有經驗的員工的話，其實對他做生意、維繫顧客關係都看不到有好處。但是這裏我要強調，如果我們發現有任何僱主走一些灰色地帶，或者名義上是符合「468」的規定，實質上他有一些手段令員工不符合的話，勞工處一定會介入。如果大家覺得有懷疑，請不要猶豫，到勞工處勞資關係科，同事們是樂意去幫大家的。

記者：日前勞工處制裁一些違規聘請輸入勞工的僱主，當中包括深水埗「明哥」的店鋪，他自己就說沒有聘請輸入勞工；同時「頂手」的新僱主也說自己沒有聘請輸入勞工。勞工處有否發現一些個案是有人借了他的名字來聘請輸入勞工？或者有沒有人在一些法律灰色地帶遊走？政府有沒有進行調查？

勞工及福利局局長：勞工處在早前發布關於違反輸入勞工規定的數個僱主資訊和資料，我們是很小心去核對發布的所有資訊，還有我們提出為甚麼會施加限制都是準確無誤的。我們不評論個別案件，但我很想強調，勞工處提供的資訊全部都是百分百準確的，無論是僱主的名字、地址、有否申請聘用輸入勞工，以及當中哪些地方是違規，我們都是清清楚楚列舉出來，所以請大家放心，我們給的數字和信息是完全準確的。

記者：早前有消息說政府高層人員可能會有些變動，想問局長有否對此進行了解？或者都有些消息說是與宏福苑事件有關，你有沒有甚麼回應？

勞工及福利局局長：今日的主題是「防跌路上同行有理」，我們主要是說防跌，還有大家最關心的是《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》和「468」，謝謝大家。"
