Development Bureau and relevant departments proactively follow up on relief work after passage of Typhoon Wipha,2025-07-20 23:26,2025-07-20 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/20/P2025072001350.htm,"A spokesman for the Development Bureau today (July 20) said that its departments and relevant departments are making all-out efforts to carry out relief work after the passage of Typhoon Wipha, with a view to enabling the community to resume normalcy as soon as possible.

As at 8pm today, the Government's 1823 Call Centre and the Fire Services Department received 286 and 425 reports of fallen trees respectively. In order to remove fallen trees affecting carriageways and footpaths as early as possible, prior to the issuance of Strong Wind Signal No. 3 by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Highways Department has commenced inspections of carriageways across the territory to immediately remove fallen trees when necessary.

During the passage of Typhoon Wipha, five reports of collapsed scaffolding were received as at 7pm. Among these, the Housing Department removed the scaffolding affecting Choi Hung Road at around 3pm and is making arrangement to dismantle the scaffolding collapsed on Wah King Street near Wah Fu Estate. The Architectural Services Department is striving to remove the scaffolding collapsed on Siu Sai Wan Road, with a view to resuming traffic soonest. There are two separate scaffoldings collapsed at private housing estates at Cloud View Road, North Point and Tin Hau Temple Road respectively. The former is affecting the outdoor carpark of the estate while the latter is affecting Tin Hau Temple Road. The Buildings Department (BD) is proactively following up with relevant owners' corporations and the scaffolding affecting Tin Hau Temple Road will be removed as soon as possible.

As at 6pm, the BD received 21 reports of building-related incidents, which mainly involve unstable windows. The BD is following up on 15 cases and has referred the remaining six cases to relevant departments for follow up.

As at 8pm, the Drainage Services Department (DSD) has received seven confirmed cases of flooding at Lam Kam Road in Tai Po, Lung Cheung Road near Lung Cheung Mall, Lung Cheung Road near Ngau Chi Wan Village, Tai Hom Road in Wai Tai Sin, Clear Water Bay Road in Sai Kung, Chuk Yuen Road in Wong Tai Sin, and Ko Chiu Road in Yau Tong. The aforementioned cases have been resolved.

As storm surge might lead to a rise in sea levels and increase the flooding risk in the area of Tai Po Market, the DSD made early preparation and implemented various flood prevention measures last night (July 19), including installing temporary water-filled flood barriers near Kwong Fuk Bridge along Lam Tsuen River in Tai Po, and placing water pumps in the vicinity of Tai Po Market and Sam Mun Tsai New Village. No report of flooding at the aforementioned locations has been received so far.

Moreover, Typhoon Wipha did not result in any landslide incidents.

The spokesman said the relevant departments have commenced a new round of special inspections after the issuance of Strong Wind Signal No. 3 by the Hong Kong Observatory to inspect roadside trees, structures (including external walls and signboards), slopes and construction sites, etc. to identity locations with potential risks after the passage of strong wind to ensure public safety. The Government urges members of the public to remain vigilant when going outdoors, and avoid staying under trees, signboards or structures with signs of concrete spalling, as well as in the vicinity of slopes. They may call the Government's 1823 hotline to report dangerous trees, slopes and structures."

僱主應與僱員訂立熱帶氣旋或暴雨後合理的工作安排,2025-07-20 19:40,2025-07-20 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/20/P2025072001052.htm,"勞工處今日（七月二十日）提醒僱主應在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告信號取消後為僱員提供合理而切實可行的工作安排，並考慮路面、交通及其他情況，彈性處理僱員復工或遙距工作的安排（如適用）。這有助維持良好的勞資關係，並確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢。

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-07-20 19:40,2025-07-20 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/20/P2025072001051.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (July 20) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."

勞工處發言人今日（七月二十日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

此外，僱員亦須與僱主／承建商合作，遵守安全指示及使用安全設備。

勞工處印備了安全指南及單張，提供有關電力工作的安全指引。這些安全刊物可在該處各分區辦事處免費索取，亦可從該處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/content2_8.htm）下載。

  A spokesman for the LD said today (July 20) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."
