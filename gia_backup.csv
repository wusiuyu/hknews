​財政司司長出席2024年傑出領袖選舉頒獎晚宴致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-06-20 21:15,2025-06-20 21:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000815.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（六月二十日）出席2024年傑出領袖選舉頒獎晚宴的致辭：

郭英成主席（星島新聞集團有限公司聯席主席）、蔡加讚主席（星島新聞集團有限公司聯席主席）、蔡晋社長（星島新聞集團有限公司社長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。很高興再次出席「傑出領袖選舉」頒獎典禮。

這個由星島新聞集團每年舉辦的選舉，轉眼已經第31年，目的是嘉許在香港不同領域中成就卓越的機構、團隊和個人。今晚的得獎者在工商金融、創新科技，以至文化藝術和社會服務等方面，各自表現突出，為香港的經濟和社會發展作出了重要貢獻。謹向各位得獎者致以最熱烈的祝賀！

香港是一個自由開放、機遇處處，且多元關愛的國際大都會，各行各業都培育出不少讓人欣賞的傑出領袖，他們的成功故事以至人生歷程，都感動和鼓舞人心，很值得我們發掘和在社會上廣泛傳揚。我注意到星島集團一直很積極推動正向動力，從傑出領袖選舉到社會上的好人好事，這些工作點滴匯聚，都為香港社會的正向思維作出貢獻!

  正向思維與正面力量，其實是推動經濟持續更好發展和增添生活幸福感的重要力量。在世界百年未有之大變局加速演進的背景下，在複雜和極之不確定的局勢中，必然是機遇與挑戰並存，現實是機遇大於挑戰。但問題是：究竟我們眼裡是看重機遇，還是放大挑戰，這一點非常關鍵。因為看到機遇會讓人激發拼勁努力向前，單純的「放負」只會導致缺乏創意、讓人裹足不前。

香港目前的經濟是穩中向前、持續發展、機遇龐大。這個機遇是源自我們搶抓科技創技變革新階段的新發展，也是由於國家的堅實支持、特區政府與社會各界的共同努力。

香港股市今年來表現亮麗，恒生指數今年來累積上升百分之15，首五個月交投量增加1.2倍，平均每日成交2,420億元。港股的新股集資額暫列全球首位，今年來接近900億。

可以說，股市的發展見證了三大智慧。第一：穩定有前途，社會與政治環境穩定，投資者才有信心。第二：科技是出路。今年來科技股表現亮麗，恒生科技指數及生物科技指數今年來分別累積升超過百分之15及40。第三：創新比較好。港股經過整固調整，去年進入上升軌道，今年來表現幾好，不少外資機構也在增加對香港市場的投資比重。

誠然，本港經濟正處轉型階段，金融及科技相關行業蓬勃發展、訪港旅客增加的同時，一些傳統行業例如餐飲及零售等正面對挑戰。大家都在積極找新的發展方向。我注意到有些餐廳將目標客群聚焦在數字資產行業的從業者和參與者，而數字資產行業的蓬勃發展，以及經常有這些機構舉辦活動，成為帶動他們生意的新動力來源。也有資深投資者買入北角整幢商廈來做Web3發展的聚腳地。另一邊廂，有零售商因為主攻潮流文化、「二次元產品」或不同IP公仔的「盲盒」，也開創了新的客源。

在不同的範疇，成功方程式都不一樣，但共通的都是解決痛點、創造價值，帶來更多嶄新的體驗。無論是消費還是股市，只有推陳出新、不斷創新，才能持續為業務帶來新的增量，也為消費者和顧客創造新的體驗。

推動經濟持續發展是為獲得生活幸福感創造有利條件，但是，人與人之間還是要互相扶持、互相幫助，一起分享，才是有「溫度」的生活。今天的得奬者之中，包括了關愛隊，我相信他們每天在前線的社區服務中，必定有很多感人的故事。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，我再次祝賀今晚的得獎領袖，希望大家能繼續以你的識見、魄力與熱誠，在各自的專業領域或社會服務中，繼續作出積極貢獻，共同為香港的美好社會與繁榮未來，以及國家的穩步發展，貢獻力量。

祝願各位工作順利、身體健康！多謝大家！"

  In her welcome speech, the Director-General of the London ETO, Miss Fiona Chau, highlighted that under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in China, and maintains its status as a free port, implements free trade policies and ensures the free flow of capital, goods, people and information.

 Miss Chau also promoted the Block Registration Incentive Scheme, launched in February this year as part of the Action Plan on Maritime and Port Development Strategy. She explained that under the Scheme, if more than one eligible ship is registered with the Hong Kong Shipping Registry within 24 months, the owners of the ships concerned may be provided with a refund of the ship registration fee and the first-year annual tonnage charge.

âWith a full-size dragon boat on display at the reception venue, Miss Chau took the opportunity to introduce guests to the vibrant traditions of the Dragon Boat Festival, along with a glimpse of the other rich cultural experiences Hong Kong has to offer.

 The reception was attended by the Director of Marine Environment Division, Dr Heike Deggim, along with around 300 guests. These included delegates from IMO member states, senior representatives from international maritime organisations, and prominent shipowner representatives based in London."

Speech by FS at HKEX 25th Anniversary Celebrations (English only)(with photos/video),2025-06-20 19:52,2025-06-20 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000762.htm,"âFollowing is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the HKEX 25th Anniversary Celebrations today (June 20):

Deputy Director Yin Zonghua (Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the HKSAR), Carlson (Chairman of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), Mr Carlson Tong), Bonnie (Chief Executive Officer of the HKEX, Ms Bonnie Chan), Kelvin (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Dr Kelvin Wong), ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. I'm delighted to be here on this special anniversary occasion. Delighted, too, that I get to strike the gong, in just a few minutes, with Carlson.

First and foremost, my warmest congratulations to HKEX on its 25th anniversary. The transformation of HKEX reflects the extraordinary rise of our country and Hong Kong, over the past quarter of a century, underlining our pivotal role in supporting the opening-up of the Mainland's financial markets.

It's a testament, too, to the bold and progressive reforms that have reshaped our listing regime. The HKEX itself is part of that reform, where the demutualisation of its predecessors and the listing of HKEX had opened up vast new horizons for growth and development. Since then, landmark initiatives such as the Connect Schemes, as well as the introduction of Chapter 18A and 18C, continue to unlock value and create fresh opportunities for market participants.

As we celebrate these and many other achievements, it is also important to look ahead. With a solid foundation built over the past 25 years, what's next?

Let us bear in mind that HKEX is far more than just another listed company. It is a cornerstone of our financial system, a trusted partner of the Government and regulators, and a key participant in safeguarding Hong Kong's financial security and enhancing market competitiveness. In this connection, allow me to share a few observations important to the continuing success of HKEX and our financial sector.

First, internationalisation. Hong Kong has long been the premier listing venue for Mainland companies. Today, nearly 60 per cent of our 2 600 listed companies are from the Mainland. They account for over 80 per cent of total market capitalisation.

Amid growing geopolitical challenges, Hong Kong has become a safe harbour for international investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. With stronger market liquidity and an increasingly global investor base, HKEX can also emerge as a preferred listing platform for companies from ASEAN, the Middle East and other regions — especially those that find it challenging to access capital markets in the US or Europe.

I am pleased to note that HKEX has already taken critical steps in this direction, including recognising more overseas exchanges to enable dual-primary and secondary listings. These efforts can only enhance the diversity, depth and resilience of our market.

Second, embracing innovation. HKEX consistently demonstrates leadership in expanding product offerings. The development of our exchange-traded products' market is a prime example. Since the launch of the Tracker Fund in 1999, our ETP market has grown significantly — covering a wide range of asset classes, including equities, bonds, derivatives and, most recently, digital assets. ETPs now account for over 15 per cent of total stock market turnover.

The opportunities in digital assets are vast. From tokenisation and smart contracts to the trading of real-world assets — it's a new frontier for global finance, and Hong Kong must be at the forefront.

Equally promising is the development of innovative financial products to support the green transition, including carbon trading and other climate-focused instruments.

Third, enhancing market infrastructure and transaction efficiency.

That includes shortening the settlement cycle. While markets in the US and Europe have already adopted or are moving to the T+1 settlement cycle, much of Asia is still assessing the path forward. HKEX, I'm pleased to say, should be technically ready for T+1 settlement by year's end. I look to Hong Kong to become a first mover in the region.

And if Hong Kong is to maintain its status as a world-class financial centre, we must also continue to reduce transaction costs and enhance market efficiency.

Ladies and gentlemen, at this time of profound change and new challenges in global financial markets, Hong Kong must act decisively to capture the emerging opportunities.

With its strong foundation, strategic vision, global connectivity and staunch government support, HKEX is doing just that. And I am confident it will continue to lead and help our markets scale new heights.

Once again, congratulations HKEX on your landmark 25th listing anniversary. I wish you continuing success in the years to come. Hong Kong, and this speaker, is banking on it.

Thank you."
衞生防護中心調查一宗本地麻疹個案,2025-06-20 19:45,2025-06-20 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000739.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心今日（六月二十日）正調查一宗本地麻疹個案，並提醒市民接種疫苗是預防麻疹的最有效方法。

個案涉及一名28歲女子。她在六月十一日因為發燒、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼睛發紅，向私家醫生求診。她於六月十三日出現皮疹，同日及翌日兩度到廣華醫院急症室求醫，六月十四日獲安排入院接受治療。病人的血液樣本經檢測後，證實對麻疹病毒抗體呈陽性反應。病人目前仍然留院，情況穩定。

流行病學調查顯示，病人不確定曾否接種麻疹疫苗，於潛伏期內沒有外遊。她的六名家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。病人在傳染期曾到訪九龍城亞皆老街206號九龍城浸信會幼稚園。中心正對該幼稚園約170名師生進行醫學監察。

由於麻疹傳染性極高，中心會設立查詢熱線（2125 2372）為該個案進行接觸者追蹤，中心呼籲曾於六月九日或六月十日上午十一時三十分至下午十二時三十分到訪九龍城浸信會幼稚園的人士致電熱線，中心會提供適切評估和建議。熱線於明日（六月二十一日）及六月二十二日上午九時至下午一時運作，並由六月二十三日至二十七日上午九時至下午五時運作。

中心的調查仍然繼續。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「麻疹的潛伏期（即由感染後到發病的時間）為七至21日。麻疹病徵包括發燒、皮膚出現紅疹、咳嗽、流鼻水和眼紅等。當出現相關病徵，市民應戴上外科口罩，停止上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方和避免與未有免疫力人士接觸，尤其是抵抗力弱人士、孕婦及未滿一歲的兒童。懷疑受感染的人士應盡早向醫生求診及告知醫護人員有麻疹接觸史。」

他續說：「在『香港兒童免疫接種計劃』下，透過衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院及學童免疫注射小組提供的免疫接種服務，本港整體免疫接種覆蓋率一直維持在非常高水平。根據小學學童的免疫接種覆蓋率及衞生署定期進行全港免疫接種覆蓋調查顯示，兩劑麻疹疫苗接種的整體覆蓋率一直維持在95%以上，而本地麻疹病毒抗體的血清陽性率反映絕大部分香港市民對麻疹已有免疫力。然而，香港作為國際旅遊頻繁的城市，仍面對輸入麻疹病毒及其在本地社區進一步傳播的潛在風險。少數未完成接種麻疹疫苗的人士（例如非本地出生人士，包括新移民、外傭、海外僱員及來港升學人士）仍有機會受感染，並把麻疹傳播給其他未具備麻疹免疫力人士，例如一歲以下尚未接種第一劑麻疹疫苗的幼兒。」

在一九六七年前出生的市民，由於當時麻疹在全球多個地方及香港仍屬風土病，故可視為透過自然感染而對麻疹具備免疫力。一九六七年或以後出生而尚未完成接種兩劑麻疹疫苗或對麻疹疫苗接種史不詳的人士，應盡快諮詢家庭醫生以完成接種，以確保市民對麻疹有足夠保護力。

今年部分海外國家的麻疹個案維持在高水平，其中北美洲（包括美國及加拿大）、歐洲及鄰近地區（包括越南、柬埔寨和菲律賓），因疫苗覆蓋接種率偏低而出現麻疹持續爆發。另外，日本和澳洲今年錄得的麻疹個案亦有所上升。因此，計劃前往麻疹流行地區的市民，應及早檢視自己的疫苗接種紀錄及病歷，若以往未經化驗確診感染麻疹，以及從未或不確定曾否接種兩劑麻疹疫苗，應在出發前最少兩星期諮詢醫生接種疫苗。

除接種麻疹疫苗外，市民應採取以下措施預防感染麻疹：
•維持良好的個人及環境衞生；
•保持室內空氣流通；
•保持雙手清潔，並用正確的方法洗手；
•雙手被呼吸系統分泌物弄污後（如打噴嚏後）應立即洗手；
•打噴嚏或咳嗽時要掩着口鼻，並妥善清理口鼻排出的分泌物；
•徹底清潔用過的玩具和家具；及
•病患者在出疹後的四日內不應上學，避免將疾病傳染給未有免疫力的人。

市民如欲索取更多關於麻疹的資料，可瀏覽衞生防護中心麻疹專頁。準備出遊的市民亦可參考衞生署旅遊健康服務網，了解香港以外地方的麻疹疫情消息。"
CHP investigates local measles infection case,2025-06-20 19:45,2025-06-20 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000740.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (June 20) investigating a local case of measles infection and reminded the public that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles.

The case involves a 28-year-old female. She sought treatment from a private doctor on June 11 for fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. She developed a skin rash on June 13 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital twice, once on the same day and again on the following day. She was admitted for treatment on June 14. Her blood sample tested positive for antibodies of measles virus upon laboratory testing. She remains hospitalised and is in stable condition.

An epidemiological investigation revealed that the patient was uncertain whether she had received a measles vaccination. She had no travel history during the incubation period. Her six household contacts are currently asymptomatic. During the communicable period, the patient had visited the Kowloon City Baptist Church Kindergarten, located at 206 Argyle Street in Kowloon City. The CHP is conducting medical surveillance on approximately 170 staff members and students of the kindergarten concerned.

As measles is highly infectious, the CHP will set up an enquiry hotline (2125 2372) for contact tracing of the case. The CHP appeals to those who visited the Kowloon City Baptist Church Kindergarten between 11.30am and 12.30pm on June 9 or 10 to call the hotline. Officers of the CHP will assess their conditions and offer health advice. The hotline will operate from 9am to 1pm tomorrow (June 21) and June 22, and from 9am to 5pm between June 23 and 27.

The investigations are ongoing.

""The incubation period of measles (i.e. the time from infection to onset of illness) is seven to 21 days. Symptoms include fever, skin rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. When such symptoms appear, people should wear surgical masks, stay home from work or school, avoid crowded places and contact with unvaccinated people, especially those with weak immune systems, pregnant women and children under 1 year old. Those who suspect they are infected should consult their doctors as soon as possible and inform healthcare workers of their history of exposure to measles,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""Under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme, the overall immunisation coverage in Hong Kong has been maintained at a very high level through the immunisation services provided by the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres and School Immunisation Teams. As evidenced by the findings on vaccination coverage of primary school students and the territory-wide immunisation surveys conducted regularly by the DH, the two-dose measles vaccination coverage has remained consistently high, well above 95 per cent, and the local seroprevalence rates of measles virus antibodies reflect that most people in Hong Kong are immune to measles. However, Hong Kong, as a city with a high volume of international travel, still faces the potential risk of importation of the measles virus and its further spread in the local community. Hence, a small number of people who have not completed a measles vaccination (such as non-local-born people including new immigrants, foreign domestic helpers, overseas employees and people coming to Hong Kong for further studies) are still at risk of being infected and spreading measles to other people who do not have immunity against measles, such as children under 1 year old who have not yet received the first dose of the measles vaccine,"" he added.

People born before 1967 could be considered to have acquired immunity to measles through natural infection, as measles was endemic in many parts of the world and in Hong Kong at that time. People born in or after 1967 who have not yet completed the two doses of measles vaccination or whose measles vaccination history is unknown, should consult their family doctors as soon as possible to complete the vaccination and ensure adequate protection against measles.

The number of measles cases in some overseas countries remains at a high level this year. The outbreaks in North America (including the United States and Canada), Europe and neighbouring areas (including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines) are ongoing due to the relatively low vaccination rate. Furthermore, an increasing number of measles cases have also been recorded in Japan and Australia this year. For those who plan to travel to measles-endemic areas, they should check their vaccination records and medical history as early as possible. If they have not been diagnosed with measles through laboratory tests and have never received two doses of measles vaccine or are not sure if they have received a measles vaccine, they should consult a doctor at least two weeks prior to their trip for vaccination.
â
Besides being vaccinated against measles, members of the public should take the following measures to prevent infection:


Maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
Keep hands clean and wash hands properly;
Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly;
Clean used toys and furniture properly; and
Persons with measles should be kept out of school till four days from the appearance of a rash to prevent the spread of the infection to non-immune persons in school.

衞生防護中心調查一宗猴痘確診個案,2025-06-20 18:00,2025-06-20 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000649.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（六月二十日）表示，正調查一宗猴痘確診個案，並提醒市民提高警覺，避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人士作密切身體接觸，同時強烈建議高風險目標群組人士接種猴痘疫苗。

個案涉及一名28歲男子。他於六月十六日開始出現皮膚潰瘍和喉嚨痛，六月十八日到衞生署油麻地男性社會衞生科診所求診。病人現於瑪嘉烈醫院進行隔離，情況穩定。

初步調查顯示，他於潛伏期內曾在香港有高風險接觸。沒有資料顯示此個案與本港早前錄得的其他猴痘確診個案有流行病學關連，中心會繼續就個案進行流行病學調查，並將個案通報世界衞生組織（世衞）。

世衞本月初就猴痘舉行了特別會議，確認猴痘疫情仍然是國際關注的突發公共衞生事件。世衞繼續呼籲成員國加強對猴痘的監測及防控措施，以減低猴痘疫情的蔓延。香港自二○二二年六月起已制定猴痘準備及應變計劃，並於同年九月出現首宗猴痘確診個案後，啓動該計劃下的戒備級別。中心實施的一系列措施（包括加強個䅁監測、接觸者追蹤、公眾教育和疫苗接種等）在過去三年有效防止猴痘在本地出現爆發。

自二○二二年起至今，本港共錄得77宗猴痘個案（63宗本地個案和14宗輸入個案），當中九宗於今年錄得，全部病人均為男性。流行病學調查顯示，絕大部分個案曾進行高風險性行為，包括與陌生人發生性行為或在沒有配戴安全套的情況下進行性行為。香港至今未有發現新型猴痘病毒株（分支Ib型）的個案。

中心提醒高風險目標群組人士應接種猴痘疫苗，以減低感染或感染後出現較嚴重病徵的機會。此外，出現猴痘症狀（包括皮疹、發燒、發冷、淋巴結腫大、疲乏、肌肉痛及劇烈頭痛等）或懷疑自己受感染的人士應立即求醫並接受治療，不應與其他人進行可能接觸到皮疹或體液的活動。市民亦應時刻保持良好個人及手部衞生，預防經接觸傳播或感染病毒，並避免與懷疑感染猴痘的人或動物作密切身體接觸。

中心設有猴痘電話熱線（2125 2373），逢星期一至五（公眾假期除外）上午九時至下午五時運作。任何人懷疑或憂慮曾與確診病人有高風險接觸，尤其是男男性接觸者或曾與陌生人發生性行為，可致電熱線查詢及獲取相關的健康建議。

此外，衞生署為高風險群組提供接種猴痘疫苗服務，以下高風險目標群組人士可以自願形式接種猴痘疫苗：


曾進行高風險性行為，例如擁有多名性伴侶、性工作者、過去十二個月有性傳播感染史；
負責照顧猴痘確診病人的醫護人員；
處理動物傳染痘病毒的實驗室人員；及
當本港動物出現猴痘個案時有較高暴露風險的照顧動物人員。


高風險目標群組人士可於衞生署轄下全部社會衞生科診所（柴灣社會衞生科診所、灣仔男性社會衞生科診所、灣仔女性社會衞生科診所、油麻地男性社會衞生科診所、油麻地女性社會衞生科診所、容鳳書社會衞生科診所、粉嶺社會衞生科診所和屯門社會衞生科診所）及衞生署油麻地綜合治療中心接種猴痘疫苗，無須預約。

衞生署九龍灣綜合治療中心，以及醫院管理局伊利沙伯醫院和瑪嘉烈醫院的特別內科診所亦會為到診者提供猴痘疫苗接種服務。

市民可參閱衞生防護中心猴痘專頁及猴痘疫苗接種計劃專頁了解更多詳情。"
CHP investigates confirmed Mpox case,2025-06-20 18:00,2025-06-20 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000651.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (June 20) that it is investigating a confirmed Mpox (also known as Monkeypox) case, and urged the public to be vigilant and avoid close physical contact with persons suspected of contracting Mpox. Meanwhile, high-risk target groups are advised to receive Mpox vaccinations.

The case involves a 28-year-old male. He developed a skin ulcer and a sore throat on June 16 and attended the Yau Ma Tei Male Social Hygiene Clinic of the DH on June 18. He is being isolated at Princess Margaret Hospital and is in stable condition.

  An initial investigation revealed that he had a history of high-risk exposure in Hong Kong during the incubation period, but no epidemiological linkages have been established between this case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong. The CHP is continuing its epidemiological investigations of the case and will report it to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The WHO held a special meeting on Mpox early this month and confirmed that Mpox remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The WHO continued to appeal to member statesto enhance surveillance and prevention and control measures forMpox in order to reduce the spread of Mpox.Hong Kong has put in place the Preparedness and Response Plan for Mpox (the Plan) since June 2022 and activated the alert response level under the Plan after the first confirmed case of Mpox in September of the same year. The CHP has implemented a series of measures (including enhanced surveillance, contact tracing, public education and vaccination) which have been effective in preventing local outbreaks of Mpox in the past three years.

Since 2022, a total of 77 Mpox cases (63 local and 14 imported) have been recorded in Hong Kong, of which nine cases were recorded this year. All the patients were male. Epidemiological investigations revealed that most cases had history of high-risk sexual behaviours, including having sex with strangers or without wearing condoms when having sex. Hong Kong has not yet detected any new Mpox strain (Clade Ib) cases.

The CHP reminded high-risk target groups to receive Mpox vaccinations in order to lower the risk of infection or the possibility of having more severe symptoms after infection. In addition, persons who experience Mpox symptoms (including rashes, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion, muscle pain, and severe headaches) or suspect themselves of being infected are advised to seek medical attention and receive treatment at once. They should not engage in activities with others that may expose others to their skin rash or body fluids. Members of the public should maintain good personal and hand hygiene to prevent virus transmission or infection through contact. They should also avoid close physical contact with persons or animals suspected of being infected.

The CHP has set up an Mpox telephone hotline (2125 2373), which operates from Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm, excluding public holidays. Those who suspect or are concerned that they may have had high-risk contact with confirmed cases, particularly men who have sex with men or those who have sexual practices with strangers, can use the hotline to make enquiries and receive relevant health advice.

Furthermore, the DH provides vaccination services to high-risk groups of Mpox. The following high-risk target groups are eligible for Mpox vaccinations on a voluntary basis:


individuals with high-risk sexual practices, e.g. having multiple sexual partners, sex workers, or having a history of sexually transmitted infection within the past 12 months;
healthcare workersresponsible forcaring forpatients with confirmed Mpox;
laboratory personnel working with zoonotic pox viruses; and
animal care personnel with high risk of exposure in case of Mpox occurrences in animals in Hong Kong.


  High-risk target groups can receive Mpox walk-in vaccinations at any of the DH's Social Hygiene Service Clinics (SocHS) (namely Chai Wan SocHS, Wan Chai Male SocHS, Wan Chai Female SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Male SocHS, Yau Ma Tei Female SocHS, Yung Fung Shee SocHS, Fanling SocHS and Tuen Mun SocHS) and the DH's Yau Ma Tei Integrated Treatment Centre.

Meanwhile, the DH's Kowloon Bay Integrated Treatment Centre and the Hospital Authority's Special Medical Clinics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Princess Margaret Hospital also provide Mpox vaccination services for their clients.

Speech by CE at HKEX 25th Anniversary Celebrations (English only) (with video),2025-06-20 17:45,2025-06-20 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000304.htm,"âFollowing is the video speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) 25th Anniversary Celebrations today (June 20):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I'm delighted to speak to you in celebrating the 25th anniversary of HKEX.

What a grand day this is for HKEX, the fast-beating heart of the financial community that has been instrumental in powering Hong Kong's rise these past 25 years. With the resounding support of our country, our financial community, which also includes our world-class regulators and the financial and professional services sector, helps to cement Hong Kong's place as one of the world's top three international financial centres.

For HKEX - for all of us - it's been a remarkable journey. Since HKEX's listing in 2000, Hong Kong has emerged as a premier global listings destination, with the number of listed companies here rising from 790 to more than 2 600 today.

A few more telling numbers. Over the past quarter of a century, our total market capitalisation has soared six times, while the average daily turnover has increased nine times.

Over the years, Hong Kong has become known, worldwide, as a preferred destination for a great many large and high-profile initial public offerings (IPOs).

This year has been particularly rewarding. Last month, we welcomed the largest global IPO of the year to date. And Hong Kong leads the world in IPO fundraising, with 29 listings and raising nearly US$10 billion in the first five months of the year. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a seven-time growth, year-on-year.

That remarkable surge in IPOs and market turnover also manifests strong global confidence in our financial ecosystem.

HKEX plays a crucial role, too, in facilitating Hong Kong's rise as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" between our country and the world at large. This past year, it added Abu Dhabi and Dubai to its list of recognised stock exchanges, which now total 20.

And then there's the mutual access programmes linking up the markets between Hong Kong and the Mainland, from the expansion of eligible ETFs (exchange-traded funds) under Stock Connect, and the enhancement of mutual recognition of funds arrangement, to the improvement measures for Bond Connect trading, and the recent announcement of plans to expand products under Swap Connect.

Together, these initiatives have realised deeper, more interconnected financial ties between the Mainland and Hong Kong markets.

Despite today's global challenges, and the economic chaos they're creating, the Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government is resolutely committed to working with HKEX and our regulators to boost market liquidity.

I am grateful to HKEX for its unwavering support of the Government's policy priorities. In the past year, HKEX has adopted a variety of initiatives, including enhancing the specialist technology listing regime, narrowing the trading spread and launching its technology enterprises channel.

Those measures also include maintaining trading under severe weather conditions. That enables investors to manage their portfolios and minimise market risks.

Earlier this year, I am pleased to note, the London Metal Exchange, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HKEX, added Hong Kong as an approved delivery point in its global warehousing network.

The approval of seven new warehouses here in just a few months is a clear and compelling statement of Hong Kong's status as an international financial, shipping and trade centre. It will go a long way to supporting our building of a vibrant commodity trading ecosystem in Hong Kong, and attracting more companies to establish a presence here.

Once again, my heartfelt congratulations to HKEX on your silver jubilee - a quarter of a century of outstanding service. Working together, I'm confident we will ensure Hong Kong's continuing success as one of the world's surpassing financial centres.

Thank you."

  Depending on circumstances and needs, the ImmD will remain committed to expediting the removal process and actively maintain close liaison with governments of major source countries of non-refoulement claimants, airline companies and other government departments to repatriate unsubstantiated non-refoulement claimants from Hong Kong as soon as practicable through all appropriate measures."
Statistics of payment cards issued in Hong Kong for first quarter 2025,2025-06-20 17:30,2025-06-20 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000560.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published today (June 20) statistics of payment cards issued in Hong Kong for the first quarter of 2025.

The payment card statistics (see Annex) include quarterly data on credit and debit cards issued in Hong Kong under the credit and/or debit card schemes of the eight payment card scheme operators (Note 1). The HKMA began to publish the payment card statistics on a quarterly basis in June 2010 to enhance transparency of the payment card industry in Hong Kong, in line with international practice.

According to the quarterly statistics, the total number of credit cards in circulation (Note 2) was 21.88 million by the end of Q1/2025. The figure represents a 4.5 per cent increase from the previous quarter and a 9.5 per cent increase from the previous year. The number and value of credit card transactions (including retail sales and cash advances) (Note 3) are susceptible to seasonal factors and the general economic environment, making the trends more prone to fluctuation. The total number of credit card transactions was 332.44 million for Q1/2025, representing a 2.0 per cent decrease from the previous quarter and a 10.0 per cent increase from the same period in 2024. The total value of credit card transactions was HK$274.1 billion for Q1/2025, representing a 1.0 per cent increasefrom the previous quarter and a 8.4 per cent increasefrom the same period in 2024. Of the total transaction value, HK$186.1 billion (67.9 per cent) was related to retail spending in Hong Kong, HK$79.0 billion (28.8 per cent) in retail spending overseas and HK$9.0 billion (3.3 per cent) in cash advances.

The total number of debit cards in circulation is not available due to overlapping of debit card brands in a single card. Like the number and value of credit card transactions, the number and value of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales and bills payments (Note 4) are also affected by seasonal factors. On a quarterly basis, the total number of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales and bills payments decreased by 1.8 per cent to54.48 million while the total value increasedby 1.1 per cent to HK$73.8 billion in Q1/2025. When compared to the same period in 2024, the total number increasedby 12.8 per cent and the total value droppedby 2.0 per cent in Q1/2025.

Note 1:The payment card statistics are compiled from data on credit and debit cards issued in Hong Kong by both authorized institutions (AIs) and non-authorized institutions (non-AIs) under the credit and/or debit card schemes of the eight payment card scheme operators (""the card operators""). The card operators, in alphabetical order, are American Express International, Inc., Discover Financial Services (Hong Kong) Limited, EPS Company (Hong Kong) Limited (EPSCO), JCB International (Asia) Ltd, Joint Electronic Teller Services Ltd. (JETCO), MasterCard Asia/Pacific Pte. Ltd., UnionPay International Co. Ltd and Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited.

Note 2:A credit card issued in Hong Kong only carries one credit card brand. The total number of credit cards in circulation refers to the total number of credit cards (i.e. cards with a credit function) issued in Hong Kong under the credit card schemes of card operators (but excluding EPSCO and JETCO, which do not operate a credit card scheme). Some of these credit cards carry debit card functions, i.e. the credit card can be used for making purchases/payments or cash withdrawal at ATMs through directly debiting cardholders' bank accounts.

Note 3: The total number/value of credit card transactions refer to the total number/value of transactions made via credit card accounts of credit cards issued in Hong Kong under the credit card schemes of card operators (excluding EPSCO and JETCO). Starting from March 2015, a Hong Kong/overseas spending breakdown of credit card retail sales transactions is provided.

Note 4:The total number/value of debit card transactions in relation to retail sales/bill payments refers to the total number/value of those transactions made via debiting cardholders' bank accounts. Some of the eight card operators do not operate a debit card scheme. Care should be exercised in combining the credit card retail sales figures and the debit card retail sales/bills payment figures because of the possibility of double counting."
Composite Interest Rate: End of May 2025,2025-06-20 17:30,2025-06-20 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000573.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (June 20) the composite interest rate at the end of May 2025 (Note 1).

The composite interest rate, which is a measure of the average cost of funds of banks, decreased by 41 basis points to 1.61 per cent at the end of May 2025, from 2.02 per cent at the end of April 2025 (see Chart 1 in the Annex). The decrease in composite interest rate reflected the decreases in the weighted funding cost for deposits and interbank funds during the month (see Chart 2 in the Annex) (Note 2).

The historical data of the composite interest rate from the end of the fourth quarter of 2003 to the end of May 2025 are available in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin on the HKMA website (www.hkma.gov.hk).

Note 1: The composite interest rate is a weighted average interest rate of all Hong Kong dollar interest-rate-sensitive liabilities, which include deposits from customers, amounts due to banks, negotiable certificates of deposit and other debt instruments, and all other liabilities that do not involve any formal payment of interest but the values of which are sensitive to interest rate movements (such as Hong Kong dollar non-interest bearing demand deposits) on the books of banks. Data from retail banks, which account for about 90 per cent of the total customers' deposits in the banking sector, are used in the calculation. It should be noted that the composite interest rate represents only average interest expenses. There are various other costs involved in the making of a loan, such as operating costs (e.g. staff and rental expenses), credit cost and hedging cost, which are not covered by the composite interest rate.

Note 2: Since June 2019, the composite interest rate and weighted deposit rate have been calculated based on the new local ""Interest rate risk in the banking book"" (IRRBB) framework. As such, these figures are not strictly comparable with those of previous months."

二○二五年第一季在香港發行的支付卡的統計資料,2025-06-20 17:30,2025-06-20 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000561.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（六月二十日）公布二○二五年第一季在香港發行的支付卡的統計資料。

支付卡統計資料（見附件）是根據八家支付卡計劃營運機構（註一）的信用卡及／或扣帳卡計劃所發行的信用卡及扣帳卡的季度資料編製而成。金管局在二○一○年六月開始按照國際慣例，公布支付卡的季度統計資料，以提高香港支付卡業務的透明度。

根據季度統計資料，於二○二五年第一季末，在市面流通的信用卡總數（註二）為2 188萬張，按季上升4.5%，按年上升9.5%。信用卡交易量及金額（包括零售銷售及現金貸款）（註三）容易受季節因素及整體經濟環境影響，走勢較為波動。在二○二五年第一季，信用卡總交易量為33244萬宗，較上一季減少2.0%，較二○二四年同期則增加10.0%。二○二五年第一季的信用卡交易總額為2,741億港元，較上一季增加1.0%，與二○二四年同期比較增加8.4%。交易總額當中，1,861億港元（67.9%）為香港消費，790億港元（28.8%）為海外消費，90億港元（3.3%）為現金貸款。

扣帳卡方面，由於同一張扣帳卡可包含多於一個扣帳卡品牌，因此難以計算在市面流通的扣帳卡總數。正如信用卡交易的情形一樣，涉及零售銷售及支付帳單的扣帳卡交易量及金額（註四）亦會受季節因素影響。在二○二五年第一季，涉及零售銷售及支付帳單的扣帳卡總交易量按季減少1.8%至5,448萬宗，總額則按季增加1.1%至738億港元。與二○二四年同期比較，二○二五年第一季的扣帳卡總交易量增加12.8%，總額減少2.0%。

註一：支付卡統計資料是根據認可機構及非認可機構在八家支付卡計劃營運機構（卡營運機構）的信用卡及／或扣帳卡計劃下、在香港發行的信用卡及扣帳卡的資料編製而成。該8家卡營運機構為美國運通國際股份有限公司、Discover Financial Services (Hong Kong) Limited、易辦事（香港）有限公司、JCB International (Asia) Ltd.、銀聯通寶有限公司、MasterCard Asia/Pacific Pte. Ltd.、銀聯國際有限公司、及Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited。

註二：在香港發行的信用卡每張僅包含一個信用卡品牌。在市面流通的信用卡總數是指根據卡營運機構（不包括易辦事及銀聯通寶，因這兩家機構沒有營運信用卡計劃）的信用卡計劃，在香港發行的信用卡（即具備信貸功能的卡）總數。部分信用卡亦具備扣帳卡功能，即有關信用卡可透過直接從持卡人銀行帳戶中扣帳的方式購物／付款或從自動櫃員機提款。

註三：信用卡交易的總宗數及總額，是指經由根據卡營運機構（不包括易辦事及銀聯通寶）的信用卡計劃在香港發行的信用卡的帳戶進行的交易的總宗數及總額。由二○一五年三月開始，已提供信用卡零售銷售交易有關香港／海外消費的細分數據。

註四：扣帳卡交易的總宗數及總額，指透過自持卡人銀行帳戶扣帳的方式進行的交易的總宗數及總額。在八家卡營運機構中，部分沒有營運扣帳卡計劃。合併計算信用卡零售銷售數字與扣帳卡零售銷售與支付帳單數字時要格外審慎，因為將兩者合併可能會出現重複計算的情況。"
二○二五年五月底綜合利率,2025-06-20 17:30,2025-06-20 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000579.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

​香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（六月二十日）公布二○二五年五月底的綜合利率。（註一）

反映銀行平均資金成本的綜合利率在二○二五年五月底為1.61厘，較二○二五年四月底的2.02厘下跌41基點（見附件圖1）。綜合利率下跌，主要反映月內存款及銀行同業資金的加權資金成本減少（見附件圖2）。（註二）

由二○○三年第四季末至二○二五年五月底期間的綜合利率，可於金管局網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）《金融數據月報》查閱。

註一：綜合利率是指銀行帳冊上所有港元利率敏感負債的加權平均利率，這些負債包括客戶存款、銀行同業存款、可轉讓存款證及其他債務工具，以及並無牽涉正式支付利息但其價值對利率變動敏感的所有其他負債（如港元不計息活期存款）。綜合利率是根據約佔銀行體系總客戶存款九成的零售銀行所提供的資料編製。應注意綜合利率只反映平均利息支出，並未涵蓋借出貸款涉及的其他成本，如營運成本（如員工及租務支出）、信貸成本及對沖成本。

註二：二○一九年六月起，綜合利率及加權存款利率已按照新實施的本地「銀行帳內的利率風險」架構計算。因此有關數字不能直接與以往月份的數字相比。"

根據季度統計資料，於二○二五年第一季末，使用中的儲值支付工具帳戶總數（註二）為8 089萬個，按季上升1.4%。在二○二五年第一季，儲值支付工具總交易量約為21億宗，較上一季下降7.6%，而總交易金額為2,884億港元，較上一季上升1.0%。總交易金額當中，460億港元為銷售點消費支付，209億港元為網上消費支付，235億港元為個人對個人轉帳，748億港元為提款，1,232億港元為增值。二○二五年第一季末的儲值金額及工具按金總額（註三）為195億港元，較上一季上升1.9%。

與二○二四年第一季末比較，二○二五年第一季末使用中的儲值支付工具帳戶總數上升9.9%，而儲值金額及工具按金總額則上升11.6%。二○二五年第一季度總交易量及總交易金額與二○二四年同期相比分別增加5.4%及43.3%。

海關早前接獲舉報，指一間位於新蒲崗的婚禮佈置公司未能提供顧客已購買的婚禮佈置服務。海關人員隨即展開調查，發現該公司早前突然結業，已預購婚禮佈置服務的顧客因而無法使用有關服務，而該公司亦未有向顧客退還款項。

經跟進調查後，海關人員今日採取執法行動，拘捕涉案婚禮佈置公司的一名四十歲男東主。

案件仍在調查中，被捕男子現正保釋候查。

海關一直高度關注事件，並呼籲受影響的市民向海關提供資料。截至今日下午三時，海關共接獲一百六十六名市民舉報，涉及約一百九十萬元的婚禮佈置服務合約。

海關提醒商戶須遵守《條例》的規定，而消費者於購買服務時亦應光顧信譽良好的商戶，在作出預繳式消費決定前要謹慎考慮。

根據《條例》，任何商戶在接受付款時，意圖不供應有關產品或意圖供應與有關產品有重大分別的產品，或沒有合理理由相信能在指定或合理的時間內供應有關產品，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁五年。

Hong Kong Customs arrests male owner of wedding decoration company suspected of engaging in unfair trade practices in sale of services ,2025-06-20 17:15,2025-06-20 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000578.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (June 20) arrested a male owner of a wedding decoration company suspected of engaging in wrongly accepting payments in the sale of services, in contravention of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO).

Customs earlier received information alleging that a wedding decoration company in San Po Kong failed to provide wedding decoration services purchased by customers. Customs officers immediately conducted an investigation and found that customers who had purchased prepaid wedding decoration services were unable to use the services after the company suddenly suspended the business earlier. The company also failed to arrange refunds to the customers.

After a follow-up investigation, Customs officers today conducted an enforcement operation and arrested a 40-year-old male owner of the wedding decoration company connected with the case.

An investigation is ongoing, and the arrested man has been released on bail pending further investigation.

Customs has been paying close attention to the incident and called on members of the public affected by the incident to provide information. As of 3pm today, Customs had received 166 complaints, involving wedding decoration contracts amounting to about $1.9 million.

Customs reminds traders to comply with the requirements of the TDO. Consumers are also reminded to procure services at reputable shops and think prudently before making decisions for consumption with prepayment.

Under the TDO, any trader commits an offence if, at the time of acceptance of payment, the trader intends not to supply the product or intends to supply a materially different product, or there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the trader will be able to supply the product within a specified or reasonable period. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the TDO to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 80 80 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk), or by filling in an online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

海關人員昨日（六月十九日）下午在天水圍天晴邨進行反私煙行動，發現該名正保釋外出的男子涉嫌在分銷私煙，於是上前截查，並在他的另一部私家車中檢獲一萬九千支私煙。海關隨後再次拘捕該名男子，以及檢取涉案的車輛。

兩宗案件共涉及約四萬二千支私煙，估計市值約十八萬九千元，應課稅值約十三萬九千元。

During an anti-illicit cigarette operation conducted in Po Tin Estate, Tuen Mun, on April 22, Customs officers arrested a man, aged 37 and claiming to be unemployed, for engaging in illicit cigarette distribution activities, and seized about 23 000 illicit cigarettes from his private vehicle. The vehicle was also detained.

During another anti-illicit cigarette operation conducted in Tin Ching Estate, Tin Shui Wai, yesterday afternoon (June 19), Customs officers spotted the same man, who was on bail, suspected of distributing illicit cigarettes. Upon interception, 19 000 illicit cigarettes were found inside another private vehicle of the man. Customs officers then arrested the man again and seized the private vehicle.

A total of about 42 000 illicit cigarettes were seized, with an estimated market value of about $189,000 and a duty potential of about $139,000, from the two cases.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Hong Kong's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position statistics for first quarter of 2025,2025-06-20 16:30,2025-06-20 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000358.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (June 20) the preliminary Balance of Payments (BoP) and International Investment Position (IIP) statistics of Hong Kong for the first quarter of 2025. This release also included the preliminary External Debt (ED) statistics of Hong Kong for the same period.

I. Balance of Payments

  Hong Kong recorded a BoP deficit of $85.4 billion (10.7% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)) in the first quarter of 2025. Reserve assets correspondingly decreased by the same amount. This was against a BoP surplus of $31.4 billion (3.8% of GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Current account

  The current account recorded a surplus of $125.2 billion (15.7% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2025. This reflects that Hong Kong's savings was greater than its investment, enabling Hong Kong to accumulate external financial assets (such as equity securities or debt securities) as a buffer against global financial volatilities. Compared with the current account surplus of $95.3 billion (12.4% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2024, the increase in surplus was mainly due to the increases in net inflow of primary income and services surplus.

  The goods deficit decreased to $3.0 billion in the first quarter of 2025, compared with $6.2 billion in the same quarter of 2024. Over the same period, the services surplus increased from $44.7 billion to $54.9 billion. The primary income inflow and outflow amounted to $521.3 billion and $441.6 billion respectively, thus yielding a net inflow of $79.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, compared with a net inflow of $61.3 billion in the same quarter of 2024.

Financial account

  An overall increase in financial non-reserve assets amounting to $245.8 billion (30.7% of GDP) was recorded in the first quarter of 2025, compared with an overall increase of $102.5 billion (12.3% of GDP) in the fourth quarter of 2024. The overall increase recorded in the first quarter of 2025 was due to the net increases in other investment, portfolio investment and direct investment, partly offset by the net decrease in financial derivatives.

  In the first quarter of 2025, reserve assets decreased by $85.4 billion, as against an increase of $31.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

II. International Investment Position

  At the end of the first quarter of 2025, both Hong Kong’s external financial assets and liabilities stood at a very high level, amounting to $54,485.1 billion (17.0 times of GDP) and $37,562.2 billion (11.7 times of GDP) respectively, a typical feature of a prominent international financial centre.

  Hong Kong's net external financial assets (i.e. assets minus liabilities) amounted to $16,922.9 billion (5.3 times of GDP) at the end of the first quarter of 2025, compared with $15,872.9 billion (5.0 times of GDP) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024. Hong Kong's net external financial assets to GDP ratio is one of the largest in the world, which provides the economy with a strong cushion against sudden external shocks.

III. External Debt

  At the end of the first quarter of 2025, Hong Kong's gross ED amounted to $14,948.8 billion (4.7 times of GDP). Compared with $14,830.0 billion (also 4.7 times of GDP) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, gross ED increased by $118.8 billion. This was mainly attributable to the increases in ED of other sectors and ED of the banking sector, partly offset by the decrease in debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending).

  As one of the world's major financial centres, Hong Kong has a significant amount of ED held against the local banking sector arising through normal banking businesses. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, 53.3% of Hong Kong's ED was attributable to the banking sector. Other ED mainly consisted of ED of other sectors (29.3%) and debt liabilities in direct investment (intercompany lending) (16.2%).

Further information

  BoP is a statistical statement that systematically summarises, for a specific time period (typically a year or a quarter), the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world (i.e. between residents and non-residents).

  IIP is a balance sheet showing the stock of external financial assets and liabilities of an economy at a particular time point. The difference between the total value of external financial assets and liabilities is the net IIP of the economy, which provides a measure of net financial claims on non residents plus gold bullion held as monetary gold.

  Gross ED, at a particular time point, is the outstanding amount of those actual current, and not contingent, liabilities that are owed to non-residents by residents of an economy and that require payment of principals and / or interests by the debtors at some time points in the future.

  Table 1 presents Hong Kong's BoP. Table 2 presents the detailed current account and capital account, while Table 3 presents the detailed financial account. Table 4 shows Hong Kong's IIP, and Table 5 shows Hong Kong's ED.

  Statistics on BoP, IIP and ED for the first quarter of 2025 are preliminary figures, which are subject to revision upon the availability of more data.

  The latest statistical tables of BoP (including seasonally adjusted current account), IIP and ED can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode260.html). Analysis of the statistics, together with the conceptual and methodological details, are presented in the publication Balance of Payments, International Investment Position and External Debt Statistics of Hong Kong, First Quarter 2025 published by the C&SD. Users can download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040001&scode=260).

Consumer Price Indices for May 2025,2025-06-20 16:30,2025-06-20 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000337.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (June 20) the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for May 2025. According to the Composite CPI, overall consumer prices rose by 1.9% in May 2025 over the same month a year earlier, slightly smaller than the corresponding increase (2.0%) in April 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI (i.e. the underlying inflation rate) in May 2025 was 1.0%, also smaller than that in April 2025 (1.3%). The smaller increase was mainly due to the decreases in inbound and outbound transport fares as well as the charges for package tours.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, the average monthly rate of change in the Composite CPI for the 3-month period ending May 2025 was -0.1%, the same as that for the 3-month period ending April 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the corresponding rates of change were 0.1% and 0.0%.

  Analysed by sub-index, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.8%, 1.6% and 1.2% respectively in May 2025, as compared to 2.6%, 1.8% and 1.6% respectively in April 2025. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 1.3%, 0.8% and 0.8% respectively in May 2025, as compared to 1.4%, 1.1% and 1.2% respectively in April 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted basis, for the 3-month period ending May 2025, the average monthly rates of change in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were all -0.1%. The corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending April 2025 were -0.2%, -0.1% and -0.1% respectively. Netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures, the average monthly rates of change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) for the 3-month period ending May 2025 were 0.1%, 0.1% and 0.0% respectively, and the corresponding rates of change for the 3-month period ending April 2025 were all 0.0%.

  Amongst the various components of the Composite CPI, year-on-year increases in prices were recorded in May 2025 for electricity, gas and water (19.7%), housing (2.9%), transport (2.2%), miscellaneous services (1.4%), meals out and takeaway food (1.3%), miscellaneous goods (0.5%), and alcoholic drinks and tobacco (0.5%).

  On the other hand, year-on-year decreases in the components of the Composite CPI were recorded in May 2025 for clothing and footwear (-5.3%), durable goods (-2.3%), and basic food (-1.4%).

  Taking the first 5 months of 2025 together, the Composite CPI rose by 1.7% over a year earlier. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.4%, 1.5% and 1.3% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.2%, 1.5%, 1.1% and 1.0% respectively.

  For the 3 months ending May 2025, the Composite CPI rose by 1.8% over a year earlier, while the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) rose by 2.4%, 1.6% and 1.3% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.1%, 1.4%, 1.0% and 0.9% respectively.

  For the 12 months ending May 2025, the Composite CPI was on average 1.8% higher than that in the preceding 12-month period. The respective increases in the CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) were 2.3%, 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. The corresponding increases after netting out the effects of all Government's one-off relief measures were 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.1% and 1.1% respectively.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that consumer price inflation stayed modest in recent months. The underlying Composite CPI increased by 1.0% over a year earlier in May, giving an increase of 1.2% in the first five months of the year. Price pressures on various major components were contained in general.

  Looking ahead, overall inflation should remain modest in the near term. Pressures from domestic costs and external prices should stay broadly in check. The Government will monitor the situation closely.

The total number of vacancies was 55 170, representing a decrease of 27% or 20 010 over the preceding year.

Employment statistics

In March 2025, the selected industries as a whole employed 2 714 400 persons.

Other information

The above employment and vacancies statistics were obtained from the Quarterly Survey of Employment and Vacancies and the Quarterly Employment Survey of Construction Sites conducted by the C&SD. In the former survey, some economic activities (e.g. those dominated by self-employment, including taxi operators and hawkers) are not covered. Therefore, the respective employment and vacancies figures relate only to those selected industries included in the survey.

經季節性調整的綜合消費物價指數，截至二零二五年五月止的三個月的平均每月變動率為-0.1%，與截至二零二五年四月止的三個月的相應變動率相同。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，相應的變動率為0.1%及0.0%。

從細分指數分析，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數在二零二五年五月份的按年升幅分別為2.8%、1.6%及1.2%，而二零二五年四月份的相應升幅分別為2.6%、1.8%及1.6%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數在二零二五年五月份的按年升幅分別為1.3%、0.8%及0.8%，在二零二五年四月份的升幅則分別為1.4%、1.1%及1.2%。

經季節性調整的甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數，截至二零二五年五月止的三個月的平均每月變動率均為-0.1%，而截至二零二五年四月止的三個月的相應變動率分別為-0.2%、-0.1%及-0.1%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，截至二零二五年五月止的三個月，經季節性調整的甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數的平均每月變動率分別為0.1%、0.1%及0.0%，而截至二零二五年四月止的三個月的相應變動率則均為0.0%。

在各類綜合消費物價指數組成項目中，價格在二零二五年五月份錄得按年升幅的類別為電力、燃氣及水（上升19.7%）、住屋（上升2.9%）、交通（上升2.2%）、雜項服務（上升1.4%）、外出用膳及外賣（上升1.3%）、雜項物品（上升0.5%），以及煙酒（上升0.5%）。

另一方面，綜合消費物價指數在二零二五年五月份錄得按年跌幅的類別為衣履（下跌5.3%）、耐用物品（下跌2.3%），以及基本食品（下跌1.4%）。

以二零二五年首五個月合併計算，綜合消費物價指數較一年前同期上升1.7%，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數的相應升幅分別為2.4%、1.5%及1.3%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，相應升幅則分別為1.2%、1.5%、1.1%及1.0%。

截至二零二五年五月止的三個月，綜合消費物價指數較一年前同期上升1.8%，而甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數分別上升2.4%、1.6%及1.3%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，相應升幅則分別為1.1%、1.4%、1.0%及0.9%。

截至二零二五年五月止的十二個月，綜合消費物價指數較一年前同期平均上升1.8%，甲類、乙類及丙類消費物價指數的相應升幅分別為2.3%、1.6%及1.4%。剔除所有政府一次性紓困措施的影響，相應升幅則分別為1.2%、1.3%、1.1%及1.1%。

評論

政府發言人表示，近月消費物價通脹保持輕微。基本綜合消費物價指數在五月按年上升1.0%，今年首五個月合計上升1.2%。各主要組成項目的價格壓力大致受控。

展望將來，整體通脹在短期內應維持輕微。本地成本和外圍價格壓力應仍會大致可控。政府會密切監察相關情況。

二零二五年第一季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸統計,2025-06-20 16:30,2025-06-20 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000369.htm,"政府統計處今日（六月二十日）發布二零二五年第一季香港國際收支平衡及國際投資頭寸的初步統計數字，並一併發布同期的香港對外債務的初步統計數字。

I. 國際收支平衡

香港於二零二五年第一季錄得854億元的國際收支赤字（相當於本地生產總值的10.7%），而儲備資產相應地減少同等數額。二零二四年第四季則錄得314億元的盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的3.8%）。

經常賬戶

二零二五年第一季的經常賬戶錄得1,252億元盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的15.7%），這反映香港儲蓄多於投資，令其累積對外金融資產（例如股本證券或債務證券），在環球金融波動時提供緩衝。與二零二四年第一季的953億元經常賬戶盈餘（相當於本地生產總值的12.4%）比較，盈餘增加主要是由於初次收入淨流入和服務貿易盈餘增加所致。

貨物貿易赤字由二零二四年第一季的62億元減少至二零二五年同季的30億元。同期，服務貿易盈餘由447億元增加至549億元。二零二五年第一季的初次收入流入和流出分別為5,213億元和4,416億元，從而產生797億元淨流入，而二零二四年同季則錄得613億元淨流入。

金融賬戶

二零二五年第一季非儲備金融資產錄得2,458億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的30.7%），而二零二四年第四季則錄得1,025億元的整體增幅（相當於本地生產總值的12.3%）。二零二五年第一季的整體增幅源自其他投資、證券投資和直接投資淨增加，而金融衍生工具淨減少則抵銷了部分的整體增幅。

二零二五年第一季儲備資產減少854億元，而二零二四年第四季則增加314億元。

II. 國際投資頭寸

在二零二五年第一季季末，香港的對外金融資產和負債總值均處於很高的水平，分別為544,851億元（相當於本地生產總值的17.0倍）和375,622億元（相當於本地生產總值的11.7倍），這是一個重要國際金融中心常見的特點。

在二零二五年第一季季末，香港的對外金融資產淨值（即資產扣除負債）達169,229億元（相當於本地生產總值的5.3倍），而二零二四年第四季季末則為158,729億元（相當於本地生產總值的5.0倍）。香港的對外金融資產淨值與本地生產總值的比率是世界最大之一，為香港經濟面對突如其來的外來衝擊發揮強大的緩衝作用。

III. 對外債務

在二零二五年第一季季末，香港的對外債務總額為149,488億元（相當於本地生產總值的4.7倍）。與二零二四年第四季季末的148,300億元（亦是相當於本地生產總值的4.7倍）比較，對外債務總額增加1,188億元，主要是由於其他界別的對外債務和銀行界別的對外債務增加所致，而直接投資債務負債（公司間借貸）的減少則抵銷了部分的增幅。

作為世界其中一個主要金融中心，香港有大量源於本地銀行界別、透過日常的銀行業務而產生的對外債務。在二零二五年第一季季末，銀行界別的對外債務佔整體的53.3%。其他的對外債務主要包括其他界別的對外債務（29.3%）和直接投資的債務負債（公司間借貸）（16.2%）。

其他資料

國際收支平衡是一項統計報表，有系統地撮錄在一個指定期間內（一般是一年或一季）某經濟體與世界各地之間（即居民與非居民之間）進行的經濟交易。

國際投資頭寸是顯示一個經濟體在某特定時點的對外金融資產及負債存量的資產負債表。對外金融資產及負債總值的差額為該經濟體的國際投資頭寸淨值，等於對非居民的淨金融債權加上作為貨幣黃金持有的金塊。

對外債務總額指一個經濟體的居民在某特定時點欠非居民的實際現有（而並非或有）未償還負債款額。負債人並須於將來某些時點償還本金及／或利息。

表1展示香港國際收支平衡。表2展示詳細的經常賬戶及資本賬戶，而表3則展示詳細的金融賬戶。表4展示香港的國際投資頭寸，而表5則展示香港的對外債務。

二零二五年第一季的國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計數字均屬初步數字，日後將根據更新資料修訂。

最新的國際收支平衡（包括經季節性調整的經常賬戶）、國際投資頭寸及對外債務的統計表可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/scode260.html）下載。相關統計數字的分析和概念及方法，載列於政府統計處出版的《香港國際收支平衡、國際投資頭寸及對外債務統計（2025年第1季）》內。用戶可以在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1040001&scode=260）下載該刊物。

Speech by DCS at Canada Day Reception (English only) (with photos),2025-06-20 16:02,2025-06-20 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000553.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, at the Canada Day Reception today (June 20):

Consul General Reeves (Consul General of Canada to Hong Kong and Macao, Mr Charles Edwin Reeves), Deputy Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon! It is a great pleasure to be here with you, in honour of Canada Day, the country's 158th anniversary.

  Today, we stand together to celebrate the deep and longstanding connections between the people of Canada and the Hong Kong SAR, who have forged strong ties from business and commerce to social, culture and family.

  Less than two months ago, Canada held its federal election. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Canada on smoothly holding the election and returning its 24th Prime Minister. I am delighted to note that, just two weeks ago, Prime Minister Carney (Prime Minister of Canada, Mr Mark Carney) spoke on the phone with Premier Li Qiang of our country. Both leaders emphasised the enormous potential in China-Canada co-operation and their determination to reset bilateral ties. This augurs well for the bilateral relations between the two nations and between Canada and Hong Kong in the foreseeable future.

  And there is so much to work together for - from safeguarding free trade and the multilateral trading system, to promoting sustainable development and building ties in any number of sectors. For this promising agenda, Hong Kong definitely has a role to play and contribute. Under the great concept and national policy of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong, as a Special Administrative Region of China, benefits from national programmes such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Another good example is the country according Hong Kong the position of the ""eight centres"" in the National 14th Five-year Plan, which has opened up a wide array of new opportunities for the relevant sectors in Hong Kong, such as finance, I&T, trade, aviation, logistics, arts and cultures and so on. The opportunities are not only for Hong Kong; they are also open to overseas companies, including Canadian enterprises, which use Hong Kong as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" between Mainland China and the rest of the world.

  Canada has a strong presence in Hong Kong. There are about 100 Canadian firms maintaining offices in Hong Kong across a broad spectrum of sectors, of which 20 are financial institutions, and some - such as Manulife and Sun Life - have been doing business in the city for more than 100 years. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, with over 2 400 members, is also the largest Canadian Chamber outside Canada.

  We thank the Canadian community and businesses for placing importance on Hong Kong. I am pleased to say that, in spite of the many changes in the external environment, Hong Kong has maintained its resilience and robustness. We still rank as the world's freest economy in the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report; our IPO (initial public offering) market is bustling with the highest number of IPOs recorded worldwide last month, recording $76 billion raised from new share offerings so far in 2025; we are the largest offshore RMB business hub, handling 80 per cent of offshore RMB transactions; and just this week, we are ranked the world's third most competitive economy in the 2025 IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Ranking. In short, Hong Kong remains a favourable place to do business.

  In addition to doing businesses, it is heartening to see that our co-operation bears fruit in other areas such as arts and culture. Last September, our Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency organised a delegation to the Toronto International Film Festival, to promote location filming in Hong Kong; and six Hong Kong films were screened at the ""Making Waves - Navigators of Hong Kong Cinema"" touring film programme in Montreal in October. And in April this year, six Canadian films and co-productions were screened at the 49th Hong Kong International Film Festival. 

  I look forward to making more waves, to more Hong Kong-Canadian co-operation - not only in film and the creative industries, but also in business and finance and every other sector, for our economies, our communities and our flourishing future.

  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having me on this joyous occasion. Happy Canada Day!

  Thank you very much."

更生灣泳灘＊





比較上周公布的泳灘等級，銀線灣泳灘的等級由三級升為二級。

環保署根據海水中的大腸桿菌水平，將泳灘水質評定為四個等級，包括良好（一級）、一般（二級）、欠佳（三級）及極差（四級）。泳灘等級是根據最近五次水樣本中大腸桿菌的幾何平均數而計算。

環保署發言人提醒市民，雖然泳灘的等級反映泳灘於一般情況下的水質，但泳灘的水質在大雨期間及過後或會暫時受到影響，泳客應該避免在風暴或大雨後三天內前往泳灘游泳。

環保署會在每個周末前公布各泳灘等級摘要。市民可於環保署網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach_chi）查閱根據最新數據評定的泳灘等級，或致電環保署泳灘水質熱線2511 6666查詢。市民亦可透過環保署的泳灘水質預測專題網頁（www.epd.gov.hk/BWQForecast），獲取各開放予公眾使用的泳灘的每日最新水質預測資訊。

  Compared with the grading released last week, Silverstrand Beach has been upgraded from Grade 3 to Grade 2.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

A launch ceremony for Payment Connect was held in Beijing today. The Governor of the PBoC, Mr Pan Gongsheng; Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council Mr Wang Linggui;and the Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,attended the ceremony and delivered remarks. The ceremony was officiated by Deputy Governor of the PBoC Mr Lu Lei. Representatives from system operators and participating institutions from the Mainland and Hong Kong also attended the ceremony.

Payment Connect refers to the linkage between the Mainland's Internet Banking Payment System (IBPS) (Note 1)and Hong Kong's Faster Payment System (FPS) (Note 2), which supports secure, efficient and convenient real-time cross-boundary payment for residents and institutions in both places. By simply inputting the recipient's mobile number or account number, residents in both places can make instant small-value cross-boundary remittances.

  Mr Yue said, ""Payment Connect is one of the key initiatives in strengthening co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong. The connection between the faster payment systems in both places enhances the efficiency of cross-boundary payments, supporting trade activities and personnel exchange. This development will further promote Hong Kong's position as an international financial centre and offshore Renminbi business hub. Payment Connect will cater to the daily needs of residents in both places for cross-boundary remittances and payments. It also signifies another milestone for the FPS in expanding cross-boundary payment.""

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on June 19 to noon today (June 20), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 233 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 145 285 samples of food imported from Japan (including 95 422 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 33 142 samples of local catch respectively.

丘應樺指，香港的初創社群近年錄得可觀發展和日趨多元化。二○二四年，香港有近4 700間初創企業，創歷史新高，較二○二三年增加約一成。初創企業創辦人的背景尤其多元，當中約28%創辦人來自香港境外。如此令人鼓舞的成績，足證香港憑藉簡單低稅制、世界級金融服務，以及聯通內地和國際商機等關鍵優勢，對創業家甚具吸引力。

丘應樺表示，香港特別行政區政府致力發展香港成為領先的創新科技樞紐，初創企業擔當重要角色。他鼓勵波爾多的初創社群來港擴展業務，善用香港作為進軍內地和亞洲龐大市場門戶的戰略位置。

丘應樺亦禮節性拜會波爾多市長Pierre Hurmic，介紹香港推動經濟發展的最新舉措，包括下調烈酒稅，並就促進初創、葡萄酒和烈酒業等方面的更緊密雙邊關係交換意見。

  Mr Yau first held a business roundtable with representatives of La French Tech Bordeaux, a start-up network, and Bordeaux-based technology start-ups to update them on Hong Kong's latest start-up ecosystem and business-friendly environment for start-ups and entrepreneurs to thrive.

  Mr Yau highlighted that Hong Kong's start-up community has seen remarkable growth and diversification in recent years. In 2024, the number of start-ups in the city reached a record high of approximately 4 700, up about 10 per cent from the previous year. The founder base is notably diverse, with around 28 per cent of start-up founders coming from outside Hong Kong. The encouraging result is a testament to Hong Kong's attractiveness to innovators, assisted by several key advantages such as a low and simple tax system, world-class financial services and the accessibility to both Mainland and international business opportunities.

  He said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is firmly committed to positioning Hong Kong as a leading innovation and technology hub where start-ups play a pivotal role. He encouraged Bordeaux's start-up community to expand their operations into Hong Kong, leveraging the city's strategic position as a gateway to the vast markets on the Mainland and in Asia.

  Mr Yau also paid a courtesy call on the Mayor of Bordeaux, Mr Pierre Hurmic, to brief him on Hong Kong's latest initiatives to drive economic development, such as the reduction of liquor duty, and exchange views on forging closer bilateral relations in various areas such as start-ups, and wine and liquor industries.

  In the evening, Mr Yau attended the Bordeaux Wine Festival, the leading wine event in France, to learn about the latest developments of Bordeaux wine and liquor.

運輸及物流局局長在立法會交通事務委員會就檢視隧道收費開場發言（只有中文）,2025-06-20 14:34,2025-06-20 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000397.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（六月二十日）在立法會交通事務委員會就檢視隧道收費的開場發言全文：

主席、各位委員：

就今日的議題，我相信大家都很關注及踴躍。讓我先講幾句，然後邀請運輸署同事以簡單的投影片，提綱挈領，就該檢視與大家分享。

今日我們就二零二五至二六年《財政預算案》演辭提及的政府隧道及主幹道收費檢視的分析結果，諮詢委員，聽取意見，同時藉此機會報告三條過海隧道實施分時段收費後的交通情況及成效。

議題一：隧道及主幹道收費檢視

我們之前推行三隧分流和大欖隧道（新收費方案），在議會內外向很多議員和社會論述時，聽到很清晰的意見，就是希望政府可以全面、整全地有一致性的原則，就政府隧道和主幹道收費給予社會一個清晰的方向。

總括而言，政府按四大原則釐定隧道收費，包括交通管理需要、公交優先、效率優先及「用者自付」，同時亦會慎重考慮市民的負擔能力。

根據四大原則，我們按優次檢視收費基礎和水平，綜合考慮各條隧道及主幹道的個別具體情況，權衡各個原則的比重。我們今日提出的建議，就是先行調整香港仔隧道及城門隧道，以及就即將開通的中九龍繞道徵收適量的隧道費，以達致有效的交通管理，而同時合乎「用者自付」的營運原則。

（一）香港仔隧道及城門隧道

我們進行了比較。香港仔隧道、城門隧道相比其替代路線行程一般較短及便捷，而兩者的替代路線目前仍有剩餘容量應付車流，加上兩條隧道已34年沒有調整收費，其營運和維修成本有所增加。以二○二四至二五年為例，香港仔隧道的營運赤字已高達1,800萬元，而城門隧道的營運赤字亦高達5,200萬元。假設所有車種全日劃一收費由5元調整至8元，預計對交通管理影響輕微，同時可達致維持收支平衡，所以我們認為有必要、亦有空間優先調整這兩條隧道的收費。

（二）中九龍繞道

即將開通的中九龍繞道會分階段開通，首先於今年年底開通油麻地隧道段，亦爭取大約在明年年中可望開通九龍灣隧道段。中九龍繞道的功能是紓緩現時九龍主要幹路的交通擠塞情況。例如，九龍灣至油麻地的行車時間由現時約30分鐘大大縮減至約五分鐘，因為使用中九龍繞道的路程短、車速高，節省燃料費和時間，預計對用家有非常大吸引力。我們預計中九龍繞道剛開通時繁忙時段的使用率已接近飽和。我們今次在文件內羅列了經檢視的三個收費情景供大家聚焦討論：（i）免費；（ii）固定17元收費，以達致收支平衡；（iii）固定10元收費。

在此我想解釋多些有關我們對交通管理的評估。政府於二○一七年籌備中九龍繞道工務工程項目時，我們估算繞道在不收費的情景下，繁忙時段行車量／容車量比率達約0.9。根據最新二○二六年的預計人口估算，中九龍繞道附近一帶，包括九龍東及將軍澳的總人口比當年估算上升約6%，最新的交通數據亦顯示九龍東西走向主要道路車流量亦比當年上升約15%。因此我們最新評估顯示，中九龍繞道開通時，車流會比當年預計為高，預計在繁忙時間達到0.97，即一開通，繁忙時間使用率會接近飽和。因此，從交通管理角度而言，我們有需要重新審視透過收費為中九龍繞道預留空間的需要；例如在10元收費情景之下，有關行車量／容車量比率約為八成，對新開通的道路是相對健康的情況。

再者，我們自二○二三年開始實施「易通行」，應用了科技，於是可以大大克服在市區密集的地方，例如中九龍繞道附近，未必有空間預留位置作收費廣場。的確科技給予我們靈活性，有更多空間和彈性，透過有效的交通管理措施，包括收費，推行有效的交通管理方案。

中九龍繞道項目投入了大量資源興建，至於營運和維護方面也會比一般道路為高，因為它全長八公里，其中七公里都是隧道，通風大樓、照明設施，以至交通管理信號系統，都會比一般道路為高。徵收10元隧道費的情景之下，約收回九成基本營運費用。綜合以上考慮，我們認為就中九龍繞道徵收適量費用不但可預留約兩成剩餘容量作很需要的、交通管理上的緩衝空間，以應付交通增長，同時能夠分流九龍中多條繁忙幹道的兩成交通，亦可在充分顧及市民的負擔能力的前提下，在一定程度上收回成本。

10元收費情景是希望在四大原則之下作出平衡，亦希望達到情理兼備。同事稍後會就每個情景的預期交通效果和收入情況向大家分享，我在此先不詳述。

至於其他隧道及主幹道，我們一樣應用了剛才所羅列的四大原則，就每條隧道和主幹道逐一審視。我們在會議文件中已羅列我們的考慮。總括而言，我們建議就每組隧道及主幹道，在期望日後會有更充分的交通配套，例如新替代路線及其他交通管理條件較成熟和優良的前提下，暫時維持現有安排，適時再作檢視。

（三）立法時間表

我們希望藉此機會與大家充分討論，爭取於今個立法年度內向立法會提交各附屬法例修訂。香港仔隧道和城門隧道的新收費預計可於立法會完成審議後一個月內實施；至於中九龍繞道，我們爭取於二○二六年年中全線開通，同步開始收費。

議題二：三條過海隧道的檢視

政府自二○二三年十二月起在三條過海隧道實施分時段收費，目的是遏抑和分散繁忙時段的交通需求，藉此理順過海交通，善用三條過海隧道的容車量。新收費實施後，整體過海隧道擠塞情況有所紓緩，隧道口附近非隧道交通明顯改善，有效達到預期的政策目標。

以西隧（西區海底隧道）為例，全日（車流量）增加19%，達到10萬4千架次；紅隧（紅磡海底隧道）全日車流量減少9%，達到9萬6千架次；東隧（東區海底隧道）亦下降7%，現時全日7萬3千架次。至於這些隧道的車龍——因為對駕駛者來說，排隊、車流比較明顯及相關——我們看到紅隧現時繁忙時間車龍縮減了一公里，東隧縮減了0.5公里，西隧輕微增加了0.4公里。

正正因為三隧分流的效果非常顯著，我相信委員都觀察到西隧的繁忙時間車流比以前明顯增加，在西隧港島出口有需要在道路作出理順。現時我們正如火如荼進行工程，在港島出口左邊增建一條行車線，明年工程完成後可令西隧南行的車流更暢順。由於看到現時分流效果顯著，西隧的車流一路增加，亦要在交通硬件設施作出配套安排，我們審視後建議暫時維持各車種收費和繁忙時段安排，讓我們可繼續持續密切監察交通情況，適時調節。

接下來，我想邀請運輸署同事以數張投影片為大家詳細介紹。希望稍後與大家互動交流，盡量回答議員的關注和意見。多謝主席。"

東九龍智慧綠色集體運輸系統全長約七公里，擬設九個車站，兩端終點站分別連接港鐵彩虹站及油塘站，走線途經彩雲、順利、順安、秀茂坪、寶達、馬游塘及藍田北，服務觀塘上坡地區超過30萬的居住人口。

政府發言人說：「東九龍智慧綠色集體運輸系統為觀塘上坡地區提供便捷的接駁交通服務，便利市民前往港鐵彩虹站及油塘站，整體改善東九龍的交通，釋放發展潛力。視乎最終採用的系統方案，由寶達前往油塘或彩虹地區的車程預計約為10至15分鐘。與路面交通相比，於繁忙時段乘搭東九龍智慧綠色集體運輸系統，估計每程可節省約一半時間。」

政府早前已就該系統項目從不同渠道收集公眾意見，包括諮詢觀塘區議會、西貢區議會和黃大仙區議會，與相關立法會議員、鄉事委員會及持份者代表交流，以及舉辦各項公眾參與活動。擬建東九龍智慧綠色集體運輸系統的建造工程會在方案獲得批准後盡快展開，預計於二○三三年或之前竣工。

根據《鐵路條例》，公眾可以由今日至二○二五年八月十九日，就東九龍智慧綠色集體運輸系統的相關方案提出反對。此外，任何有可獲得補償權益的人士均可根據該條例的規定申索賠償。

該方案和圖則已上載路政署網頁（www.hyd.gov.hk/tc/our_projects/railway_projects/index.html）。市民亦可於辦公時間內前往中西區民政諮詢中心、觀塘民政諮詢中心、西貢民政諮詢中心、黃大仙民政諮詢中心、九龍東區地政處及西貢地政處查閱，或向路政署購買紙本方案和圖則，詳情可致電2762 3976向路政署查詢。"

The SGMTS-EK is about 7 kilometres long with nine stations. The termini will be connected to MTR Choi Hung Station and Yau Tong Station respectively, with alignment passing through Choi Wan, Shun Lee, Shun On, Sau Mau Ping, Po Tat, Ma Yau Tong and Lam Tin North, serving over 300 000 residents in Kwun Tong uphill areas.

A Government spokesman said, ""The SGMTS-EK will provide convenient transport feeder services to the uphill areas of Kwun Tong, facilitating the public in gaining access to MTR Choi Hung Station and Yau Tong Station, improving the overall transportation and unleashing the development potential of East Kowloon. Depending on the system to be adopted eventually, the estimated journey time from Po Tat to Yau Tong or Choi Hung areas is about 10 to 15 minutes. Compared with road-based transport, it is expected that taking the SGMTS-EK in peak hours will save journey time by about half.""

The Government has collected public views on the SGMTS-EK earlier from multiple channels, including consultation with the Kwun Tong District Council, Sai Kung District Council and Wong Tai Sin District Council, exchanging views with relevant Legislative Council Members, representatives from relevant rural committees and stakeholders, and organising various publicity activities. The construction of the proposed SGMTS-EK will commence soon after the authorisation of the scheme and is expected to be completed by 2033 or earlier.

Under the Railways Ordinance, members of the public may object to the scheme in relation to the SGMTS-EK from today until August 19, 2025. Additionally, any person who has a compensable interest can claim compensation under the provisions of the Ordinance.

The scheme and relevant plans are viewable on the Highways Department (HyD) website (www.hyd.gov.hk/en/our_projects/railway_projects/index.html). They are also available for public inspection during office hours at the Central & Western Home Affairs Enquiry Centre; the Kwun Tong Home Affairs Enquiry Centre; the Sai Kung Home Affairs Enquiry Centre; the Wong Tai Sin Home Affairs Enquiry Centre; the District Lands Office, Kowloon East; and the District Lands Office, Sai Kung.

If the selected PVRMs meet the basic requirements, the department will send notices by registered mail to the applicants in batches, requiring them to pay a deposit of $5 000 within the period specified in the notice. If an applicant fails to pay the deposit within that period, his or her application will be cancelled automatically and will not be further processed.

Upon receipt of the deposit, the Commissioner for Transport will determine, with the assistance of a vetting committee, whether an application should be approved or rejected.

  The Bill seeks to amend the Betting Duty Ordinance (Cap. 108) and relevant subsidiary legislation to provide for a regulatory framework for basketball betting, which includes granting the power to the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs to issue a licence for conducting basketball betting and to impose licensing conditions; the calculation and collection of betting duty (which is charged at 50 per cent of the net stake receipts, same as that for the football betting duty); and expanding the functions of the Betting and Lotteries Commission to cover matters relating to the regulation of basketball betting.

A spokesman for the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau said, ""As a matter of policy, the Government does not encourage gambling. The Government adopts a multipronged strategy to address gambling-related problems, including law enforcement against illegal gambling activities, public education on the harms of gambling addiction, provision of counselling and support services for people in need, as well as regulation of gambling activities through legislation. On the regulation of gambling activities through legislation, the policy objective of providing authorised gambling outlets is to address the public demand for certain gambling activities,preventing people from turning to illegal operators.""

The spokesman added, ""If the Bill is enacted, we will, by making reference to the current regime of horse race betting and football betting, issue a licence for basketball betting to the Hong Kong Jockey Club, and to impose licensing conditions so as to minimise the negative impact of gambling on the public, especially on young people.

  ""We will continue to closely collaborate with the Ping Wo Fund Advisory Committee to strengthen publicity and counselling for young people. To this end, in addition to the existing four funded counselling centres, we will allocate additional resources to establish a new centre dedicated to providing counselling and support services for youth. Public education efforts will also be strengthened to emphasise to young people that participating in illegal gambling or placing bets with an illegal bookmaker is already a criminal offence.""

The Bill will be introduced into the Legislative Council for first reading on July 2."

民青局發言人表示：「政府一貫的政策是不鼓勵賭博。針對賭博問題，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括透過執法打擊非法賭博活動、透過公眾教育宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害、為有需要人士提供輔導和支援服務，以及透過法例規管賭博活動。在透過法例規管賭博活動方面，政府提供合法賭博途徑的目的，在於回應市民對某些賭博活動的需求，以免他們轉向非法的經營者下注。」

發言人補充：「若《條例草案》獲通過，我們將會參考現時賽馬和足球博彩的模式，向香港賽馬會發出籃球博彩牌照，並制定相關牌照條件，以進一步減少賭博對市民（尤其是青少年）的不良影響。」

「我們亦會繼續與平和基金諮詢委員會緊密合作，加強對青少年的宣傳及輔導工作。為此，在現時資助的四間輔導中心以外，我們會增撥資源，設立專注於為青少年提供輔導及支援服務的新中心。我們亦會加強透過公眾教育提醒青少年，參與非法賭博，向非法收受賭注者投注已屬違法。」

 The Bill requires SDUs in residential buildings to comply with a set of minimum standards of living conditions, including internal floor area, headroom, fire safety, structural safety (i.e. loading), lighting and ventilation, toilet, water supply point, as well as water and electricity meters, and to obtain BHU recognition before they are allowed to be let out for habitation. There would be criminal liability on the person who lets out unrecognised SDUs, while the tenants concerned will not be held liable.

 A Government spokesperson said, ""As a transitional arrangement to implement the BHU regulatory regime progressively, the Government will set up a 12-month registration system for residential flats with pre-existing SDUs, under which a 36-month grace period will be provided to SDUs in registered flats for carrying out necessary alteration works and making applications for BHU recognition. Unregistered SDUs, registered SDUs with grace period expired, as well as new SDUs entering the market must apply for recognition as up-to-standard BHUs before they can be lawfully let out for habitation.""

 The spokesperson added, ""Since the establishment of the Task Force on Tackling the Issue of Subdivided Units in October 2023, the Government has extensively consulted various stakeholders on the handling of the SDU issue. A two-month stakeholder consultation exercise was conducted in December 2024 on the legislative proposals for the BHU regulatory regime. The LegCo Panel on Housing was also consulted in December 2024 and March 2025 respectively. During the period, nearly 40 engagement sessions were organised with nearly 700 participants met, and a total of some 2 200 written submissions of views (including around 1 600 template submissions) were received. Stakeholders generally supported the policy objective and legislative framework of the BHU regulatory regime. The Bill has suitably reflected the views received. Overall speaking, stakeholders and society have responded positively to the legislative proposals.""

  The Government will make every effort to facilitate the LegCo's scrutiny work and strive for the LegCo's passage of the Bill as soon as possible, with a view to rolling out the BHU regulatory regime in March 2026, which represents a significant milestone in eradicating substandard SDUs."
《簡樸房條例草案》刊憲,2025-06-20 09:20,2025-06-20 09:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/20/P2025062000013.htm,"​政府今日（六月二十日）在憲報刊登《簡樸房條例草案》（《條例草案》），旨在為出租住宅樓宇分間單位引入規管制度，以確保分間單位能提供安全和合理的居住環境，全面有序處理劣質「劏房」這個「老大難」的問題。《條例草案》將於七月九日提交立法會進行首讀及二讀。

《條例草案》要求住宅樓宇分間單位須符合一系列有關居住環境的最低標準，包括內部樓面面積、樓底淨高度、消防安全、結構安全（即荷載）、照明及通風、廁所、供水點及水電錶等，以及取得「簡樸房」認證，方可合法出租作居住用途。如有人將未獲認證的分間單位出租便要負上刑事責任，而相關租客則不會涉及法律責任。

政府發言人表示，作為逐步落實「簡樸房」規管制度的過渡安排，政府會為現存分間單位所處的住宅單位設立為期12個月的登記制度，並給予為期36個月的寬限期，讓已登記住宅單位內的分間單位進行所需的改造工程和申請「簡樸房」認證。沒有登記的分間單位、已登記但寬限期屆滿的分間單位，以及新進入市場的分間單位，均須申請認證成為合標準的「簡樸房」，方可合法出租作居住用途。

發言人補充：「政府自二○二三年十月成立『解決劏房問題』工作組以來，就解決『劏房』問題廣泛諮詢不同持份者，並於二○二四年十二月就『簡樸房』規管制度立法建議進行了為期兩個月的持份者諮詢，以及分別在二○二四年十二月和二○二五年三月諮詢立法會房屋事務委員會，其間合共舉辦了近40場會議、與近700人次會面，以及收到約2 200份書面意見（當中包括約1 600份範本意見書）。持份者普遍認同「簡樸房」規管制度的政策目標和立法框架，《條例草案》已適當地反映了收到的意見。整體來說，持份者及社會對立法反應正面。」

政府會全力配合立法會的審議工作，爭取立法會盡快通過《條例草案》，以期在二○二六年三月推行「簡樸房」規管制度，為告別劣質「劏房」踏出具有重大意義的一步。"
