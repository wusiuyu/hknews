Speech by DCS at Welcome Reception of Zonta International 23rd District 17 Conference (English only),2025-09-25 19:22,2025-09-25 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500920.htm,"Following is the speech by the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, at theWelcome Reception ofthe Zonta International23rdDistrict 17 Conference today (September 25):

President Salla Tuominen (President of Zonta International),Governor Winnie Wong (Governor, Zonta International District 17),Chair Teresa Lin (Chair, Zonta International 23rdDistrict 17 Conference Organising Committee),Secretary Mak (Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak),Zontians, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. It is a huge delight to join you tonight. I would like to first extend our warm welcome to all of you. We are honoured that you have chosen our city to kick-start the conference.

Hong Kong is Asia's world city enjoying the best of East and West. Famous for its hard assets, such as skyscrapers, world-class infrastructure and superb transportation system, Hong Kong also has many soft appeals in terms of mouth-watering delicacies, beautiful countryside, interesting islands, and a vibrant year-round calendar of exciting sports and cultural events.

The other thing that makes Hong Kong a dynamic hub for events is our people. The talent, diversity and drive of our citizens are our greatest asset. Central to this success story of Hong Kong is the incredible and indispensable contribution of women.

Today, women account for over half of our population and are making remarkable strides in all sectors. More than half of our solicitors and public accountants are women, a significant leap from just some 30 per cent two decades ago. Furthermore, the share of women in managerial positions has reached a record high of 38 per cent. The current-term Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has also set a record, with seven out of 15directors of bureaux being women. These figures are more than just numbers; they represent a growing cohort of female leaders who are to innovate and make changes to shape the future of Hong Kong.

The HKSAR Government firmly believes in equality for women and the potential and power of women. We have set up a Women Empowerment Fund to provide financial support to projects that help women of all ages and backgrounds to unleash their potential. Last year's inaugural Family and Women Development Summit provided a platform for dialogues that facilitate the healthy development of families and women, while a one-stop Family and Women Portal centralises useful information related to family education and women's development for the public. Most recently, we launched a ""She Inspires"" Mentorship Programme to connect female university students with established women leaders to foster a cycle of empowerment and guidance that will inspire for years to come.

This drive for progress is also being championed in the private sector. One example is the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's requirement for listed companies to eliminate single-gender boards in 2022. The proportion of Hong Kong-listed issuers with at least one female board member has now risen to over 99 per cent. This is a powerful step towards ensuring seats for women at tables where decisions are made.

I am glad to see that our community is collectively championing the cause of gender equality and women's empowerment. This collective effort is especially important in 2025, as we mark the 30th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. This landmark global agenda for women's empowerment remains as relevant today as it was three decades ago. Its vision remains a guiding light for our work, and it is heartening to see its principles so strongly espoused here in Hong Kong.

I thank Zonta for hosting the conference, which so effectively focuses our community's attention on promoting women's development. The vision of Zonta chimes in perfectly with Hong Kong's own commitment to progress. We stand with you in the pursuit of a world where every woman is empowered to realise her full potential and where her rights are fundamentally recognised and protected.

In closing, I hope you enjoy the rest of the reception with wonderful company. As you move on to Macao for the main conference tomorrow, I also wish you all a fruitful journey ahead. Thank you very much."
行政長官出席香港潮屬各界慶祝中華人民共和國成立76周年酒會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-25 19:06,2025-09-25 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092501154.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（九月二十五日）出席香港潮屬各界慶祝中華人民共和國成立76周年酒會的致辭：

劉光源副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、陳振彬主席（香港潮屬各界慶祝中華人民共和國國慶籌備委員會主席）、林建岳執行主席（香港潮屬各界慶祝中華人民共和國國慶籌備委員會執行主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！大家好，個個好，人人好！（潮州話）香港剛剛經歷超強颱風樺加沙吹襲，政府超前部署，在預警通報、動員統籌、防災應對及善後復原等方面，全面準備及廣泛部署，凝聚社會共識，更多謝市民配合，共同發揮力量，把破壞降低，再次抵禦了極端天氣的嚴峻威脅。

政府全速推進善後工作，搶修路面及公共設施，市面大致恢復正常運作。包括今天的聚會可如常舉行，我非常鼓舞可以和大家聚首一堂，一同慶祝中華人民共和國成立76周年。

七十六載砥礪前行，國家創造了舉世矚目的發展奇蹟，成為世界第二大經濟體。國家發展是香港最強大的後盾和最大的機遇。

在國家的大力支持、特區政府全力推動、香港市民的不懈努力下，香港已成為首屈一指的國際金融中心、航運中心、貿易中心。在今日剛公布的《全球金融中心指數》報告中，香港的整體評分上升四分至764分，繼續是位居全球第三、亞太區第一的國際金融中心。香港與位列全球第二的金融中心的差距只差一分，成績令人鼓舞。

報告中，香港排名躍升至全球第一的領域更包括「金融科技」、「營商環境」、「基礎設施」、「聲譽及綜合」等，彰顯香港作為國際金融中心領先地位與實力。

香港在其他國際報告中排名亦屢創新高，包括全球競爭力上升四位至世界第三、人才競爭力兩年共上升12位至世界第四，這些都反映政府的施政方向正確和香港社會各界團結奮進、香港人善拼敢贏的成功特質。

潮籍鄉親以勤奮拼搏的精神著稱，是推動香港社會繁榮與經濟發展的重要力量。多年來，潮屬各界堅定支持並積極配合特區政府施政，推動社會公益，我肯定在座「自己人」（潮洲話）的貢獻。

我在上星期三發表新一份《施政報告》，為香港主動對接國家發展戰略、實現突破新局面作出了策略部署。在「一國兩制」下，香港擁有「引進來、走出去」的獨特優勢。過往我們較着重「引進來」，但香港未來的新機遇將更突顯在「走出去」。

這是因為全球貿易秩序正在重塑，內地企業不再聚焦單一國家，而轉向積極「出海」開拓新興市場。在內地企業「出海」過程中，香港也獲得大量商機，帶來各種收益，涵蓋服務業、專業人士、融資等方面，實現互利共贏的局面。

我會整合香港的外地辦事處，組成一站式平台「內地企業出海專班」，吸引更多企業利用香港平台「出海」，為香港創造更多商機和經濟回報。

潮籍社群遍布全球，尤其在東南亞地區根基深厚，擁有穩固的商業網絡，可以在「出海」過程中發揮積極作用。我鼓勵大家積極用好「引進來、走出去」策略，將你們的深厚人脈與商業智慧，轉化為香港與內地企業攜手進軍海外市場的具體優勢。潮籍鄉親勤奮拼搏、自強不息，必然可以發揮更大力量，為香港的發展和繁榮，貢獻更大的拳頭力量。

最後，我祝願祖國富強昌盛，潮港兩地欣欣向榮，各位身體健康、家庭幸福。多謝大家。"
​香港再次獲評為全球最自由經濟體,2025-09-25 19:05,2025-09-25 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092501166.htm,"菲沙研究所今日（九月二十五日）發布《世界經濟自由度2025年度報告》（《2025年報》），香港繼續獲評為全球最自由經濟體。在五個評估大項中，香港在「國際貿易自由」蟬聯首位，在「穩健貨幣」及「監管」的排名亦高踞全球第三位。

香港特別行政區（特區）政府發言人表示：「菲沙研究所的報告再一次肯定香港的自由市場優勢，以及開放、高效和公平的營商環境。在當前地緣政治、單邊主義和保護主義加劇、衝擊國際貿易體系和全球經濟秩序之際，香港將一如既往堅定保持自由港的地位、實行自由貿易、簡單低稅制等政策，維持資金、資訊、貨物和人才自由流動，發揮『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的角色和功能，歡迎海內外的企業和人才來港投資興業和發展事業。」

「今年以來，全球經濟因單邊關稅面臨巨大不確定性，國家則堅持高水平雙向對外開放，加上科技創新不斷取得突破，為區域和全球經濟注入穩定性和增長動力。香港在『一國兩制』下，保持內聯外通、國際化和多元包容的獨特優勢，加上穩定和可預測的經濟和金融政策，以及開放、高效和公平的市場，吸引了全球投資者、企業和人才來港落戶。港股表現暢旺、銀行存款持續上升、資產和財富管理業不斷增長等，都反映國際投資者對香港的肯定；而在多項關於金融、創科、教育、人才等的國際競爭力排名，香港亦續創佳績，反映香港的核心優勢與特區政府推動經濟社會發展的努力，普遍獲得國際認同。」

「事實上，本屆特區政府積極吸引企業、資金和人才來港，成績顯著。截至去年，有近10 000家母公司在海外及內地的企業選擇香港作為基地，創歷史新高。自二○二二年底至今，引進重點企業辦公室已吸引逾80間重點企業在香港落戶或拓展業務，其中不少是從事前沿科技的全球領軍企業。今年首八個月，投資推廣署共協助了超過440間企業在港開設或擴展業務，較去年同期增加14%，來自海外及內地的企業約各佔一半。這些數字彰顯了香港卓越的營商環境對海內外企業都極具吸引力。在吸引人才方面，各項人才入境計劃自二○二二年底起至今年八月，已收到接近53萬宗申請，批出超過35萬宗，當中超過23萬人來港。」

「展望未來，香港會繼續積極融入國家發展大局、更主動對接國家發展戰略，繼續維持自由、開放、公平的營商環境，發揮好内聯外通的優勢，為全球投資者創造價值和機遇。我們既鞏固優勢產業，更培育新興產業和領域；在深化與傳統市場關係的同時，又努力拓展與全球南方市場的聯繫。行政長官上周發表的《施政報告》，就推動香港經濟進一步發展提出了清晰的目標和具體的措施，包括加快發展北部都會區、發展和革新產業、積極推動粵港澳大灣區建設、鞏固香港國際中心地位等。有國家的堅實支持、特區政府和社會各界的共同努力，香港在由治及興的路上，發展前景必將更加亮麗。」

至於《2025年報》中有關香港國安法律方面的提述，發言人指出：「特區政府嚴格按照國家《憲法》和《基本法》保障香港居民的權利和自由，而企業和投資者的利益亦依法得到充分保障。這幾年間，國安法律的實施讓香港恢復安全穩定的環境，不僅保障了市民大眾的權利和自由，同時也讓香港成為更吸引國際資金和投資的安全港。在『一國兩制』下，香港特區繼續實行普通法、堅定維護法治，司法機構一直獨立行使審判權。根據各項調查，在港外商普遍對香港的法治抱有高度信心。香港在多項國際排名均取得佳績，亦充分印證香港的營商環境深獲國際認同。特區政府希望日後進行的《世界經濟自由度》評估，可以充分了解和反映有關的事實。」"

本院會全力配合警方調查，並已透過早期事故通報系統向醫院管理局總辦事處呈報事件。"
​香港在《全球金融中心指數》排名第三  評分與首兩名拉近,2025-09-25 18:40,2025-09-25 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500979.htm,"英國Z/Yen集團與中國（深圳）綜合開發研究院今日（九月二十五日）聯合發布第38期《全球金融中心指數》報告，香港的整體評分上升4分至764分，繼續位列全球第三，亞太區第一，與位列第一的紐約和第二的倫敦的分數差距，分別收窄至2分和1分。

在報告中，香港在金融科技的排名由全球第四躍升至第一；在「營商環境」、「基礎設施」及「聲譽及綜合」方面的排名亦進一步上升至全球第一，而在「人力資本」及「金融業發展水平」方面則分別位列全球第二和第三。此外，在多個金融行業領域從業員的評價中，香港亦名列前茅，其中在「銀行業」、「投資管理」、「保險業」及「融資」均繼續保持全球三甲內。

政府發言人表示：「報告充分肯定香港作為國際金融中心的領先地位、實力與競爭力。當前，全球政經格局複雜多變，香港保持『一國兩制』下的獨特優勢，憑藉內聯外通、國際化和多元包容的特質，全面發揮『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的角色，為全球投資者提供穩定、可預測的政策和投資環境，滿足他們多元化資產配置的需要。事實上，自去年以來，海內外資金流持續入本港股市、銀行體系及資產及財富管理業，股市交易、新股市場及再融資市場都十分活躍。」

發言人續表示： 「香港在金融科技方面獲評為全球第一，顯示特區政府和業界多年來共同努力，以科技賦能更便捷高效和普惠包容的金融服務，獲得了國際認同。特區政府積極擁抱金融科技的發展，金融監管機構通過沙盒等鼓勵前沿技術的測試和應用；同時也穩慎推動數字資產的發展，政府今年六月發表《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》，正是要展示我們決心打造香港成為全球數字資產領域的創新中心。穩定幣發行人制度今年八月已經實施，我們亦正就數字資產交易及託管服務的發牌制度制訂立法建議。」

發言人續說：「《行政長官2025年施政報告》公布了一系列政策措施，進一步強化香港金融體系，持續推動股市、固定收益市場和資產及財富管理業務的發展，並在中央部委的支持下，深化和擴大『互聯互通』，以及支持人民幣國際化的穩慎推進；同時加速發展新增長點，包括建立國際黃金交易市場和建設大宗商品交易生態圈，鞏固提升國際金融中心地位。」

「我們會持續強化股票巿場，包括推動更多海外和內地企業來港上巿，進一步完善主板上巿和結構性產品發行機制，以及探索縮短股票結算周期至T＋1等。我們也會繼續推動港股人民幣交易櫃台納入『股票通』南向交易。」

「我們亦會持續提升金融基建，包括香港金融管理局旗下的迅清結算（CMU OmniClear）將與香港交易及結算所有限公司合作，研究讓投資者在單一平台集中管理及抵押股票和債券等不同資產，促成不同『互聯互通』機制的聯動。此外，我們也會推動更多善用離岸人民幣和中國國債的措施，進一步滿足投資者需要，增強香港連通中外資本市場的功能，以及作為全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的角色。」

「在資產及財富管理方面，截至去年年底香港管理資產總值達35.1 萬億港元，按年增加13%，淨資金流入按年上升81%至7,050億港元，充分顯示海內外投資者對香港市場的肯定。」

自二○○七年起，《全球金融中心指數》報告於每年三月和九月發布。第38期報告評估全球120個金融中心，香港的總排名為全球第三位，整體評分為764分。"

""Apeiron"" by Aither Entertainment Limited won the Champion prize, while ""Savoir by EasyHear"" by Logital Co. Limited and ""AI powered Encapsulation and Microfluidic Platforms for Diverse Cell-based Applications"" by Rain Biotech Solutions Limited won the First Runner-up and Second Runner-up prizes respectively. The three winning teams will represent the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to compete in the Global Final Contest of the Maker in China to be held in the fourth quarter of this year in Guangzhou.

 Addressing the event, the Commissioner for Digital Policy, Mr Tony Wong, said that to align with the country's innovation and technology (I&T) development strategy, the HKSAR Government has been committed to nurturing local I&T start-ups to strengthen the I&T capabilities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The MiCHK serves as an excellent platform for Hong Kong start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to expand their business and enter the Mainland market. In recent years, many award-winning teams from Hong Kong have successfully connected with multiple Mainland enterprises through the MiCHK, establishing a presence on the Mainland and setting up branch offices and sales networks in various GBA cities, as well as in Hangzhou, Xi'an and Beijing. Furthermore, many teams have attracted the attention of enterprises and investors from the Mainland, receiving procurement contracts or reaching strategic collaboration agreements. This has enabled their I&T products and solutions to be successfully implemented in various provinces and cities on the Mainland.

 Mr Wong pointed out that this year's contest has particularly included frontier technological fields such as low-altitude economy and aerospace, intelligent devices and robotics, as well as semiconductors and integrated circuits, in order to support the development of emerging and future industries. He congratulated the winning teams and encouraged all participants to continue striving for excellence in the innovation and entrepreneurship arena, injecting new momentum into the country's high-quality development through their innovative achievements.

 The MiCHK 2025 has received overwhelming responses, reaching a record high of 157 local innovation projects. After initial screening and a semi-final held earlier, the top 10 finalists entered the Final today, where they competed for the Champion, First Runner-up and Second Runner-up honours by staging roadshows to a panel of judges comprising local and Mainland experts of different I&T fields. In addition, one-on-one business matching sessions between the top 10 finalists and investors and enterprises from the GBA were arranged today. The top 10 finalists were given opportunities to join different incubation and acceleration programmes and exhibitions to promote their products and services to different regions through various platforms, connect with Mainland investors, set up in the Mainland entrepreneurial parks and receive guidance on result transformation. Please refer to makerinchina.hk/ for details about the entries.

 With the support of the Guangzhou Municipal Industry and Information Technology Bureau, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the People's Government of Guangzhou Municipality and the People's Government of Guangzhou Nansha District, this is the seventh time the regional chapter has taken place in Hong Kong.

立法會：發展局局長就《2025年業權及土地的註冊（雜項修訂）條例草案》恢復二讀辯論發言全文（只有中文）,2025-09-25 18:08,2025-09-25 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092501060.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上就《2025年業權及土地的註冊（雜項修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）恢復二讀辯論的發言全文：

主席：

我感謝剛才二讀辯論過程中，多位議員先後發言支持《2025年業權及土地的註冊（雜項修訂）條例草案》，以業權註冊制度逐步取代在香港已實施了超過180年的契約註冊制度。

正如大家都知道，香港是少數仍沿用契約註冊制度的經濟體系。目前實行的契約註冊制度並不提供物業業權的保證。因此，在物業轉讓時，需要徹底查核過往業權文件以確定業權，令物業交易程序變得繁複、冗長，物業擁有人亦須妥為保存很多業權文件。

政府於二○○四年制定《土地業權條例》，以業權註冊制度取代契約註冊制度。但是，由於實施這條條例的執行細節非常多，各方又未能就主要議題達成共識，因此，條例至今仍未生效。為讓新制度早日落實，政府建議先易後難，在新土地先行實施業權註冊制度，即「新土地先行」方案，而在稍後階段才處理現有土地的轉制事宜。甚麼是新土地？我們在條例修訂中指出，「新土地」是《業權條例》生效當日或之後，透過賣地、私人協約，以及以換地方式批出的土地。政府就這個「新土地先行」方案廣泛聽取持份者的意見，方案獲得《業權條例》督導委員會的一致同意。這個委員會由土地註冊處處長主持，成員包括法律界、銀行界、地產界、鄉事等界別代表。我們亦於二○二二年十二月以及今年一月兩度諮詢立法會發展事務委員會，亦獲得普遍支持。

所以我們今年二月將《條例草案》提交立法會，建議修訂《業權條例》，以及對超過70項其他法例作出相關修訂。在此，我衷心感謝法案委員會主席劉國勳議員、副主席江玉歡議員、委員會各委員、立法會秘書處、法律顧問、律政司團隊，以及發展局和土地註冊處同事的不懈努力，讓《條例草案》的審議工作得以順利進行。這條條例看似簡單，其實是相當複雜，有很多的技術性。法案委員會在今年四月開始工作，至七月完成審議，召開七次會議，包括公聽會。出席公聽會有不少專業團體，例如香港律師會和香港測量師學會等等，當中律師會更先後向法案委員會提交了三份書面意見，讓我們有機會逐一詳細回應。在法案委員會審議階段，委員深入討論，高效、仔細地審議超過600頁的草案文本，提出很多寶貴意見。

在此之外，除了在議會內的討論，無論是主席、副主席和很多委員，大家都在自己的網絡與持份者繼續溝通，了解他們的關注，我們對此非常感激。政府經審慎考慮後，採納了多項建議，我會在稍後提出修正案，並且屆時再向大家講解修正案的內容。

雖然大家在席都很明白這條《條例草案》，希望大家都不介意我公開地講講它的一些重點。

（一） 業權不可推翻原則

首先第一方面的重點，就是這條《條例草案》確立了業權不可推翻原則。

在業權註冊制度下，業權註冊紀錄是業權不可推翻的證據，這是大原則，我們稱之為「以冊為準」。既然是這樣，日後如果在這個制度之下註冊的新土地，即使日後業主遺失了地契或其他有關文書，是不會影響他證明自己擁有的業權，這一點非常重要。既然有這個大原則，《條例草案》訂明，即使物業交易曾牽涉第三者的欺詐，已付出有值代價並管有物業的真誠及對欺詐不知情的買家，他的名字已經註冊在「冊」上，「以冊為準」，所以他可享有不可推翻的業權。這安排既切合我們的大原則，亦與其他司法管轄區的安排看齊。至於未能取回物業的不知情前業主，他有權獲得土地業權彌償基金下的補償。同樣，由於業權註冊制度的目的是為業權提供明確性，《條例草案》亦建議新土地將會不接受逆權管有的申索。

法案委員會討論期間，議員不但支持這安排，亦希望政府早日處理涉及其他土地的逆權管有事宜，讓私人土地避免受侵佔。政府會另行積極探討，如何處理涉及現有土地的逆權管有申請制度。

（二） 減低物業欺詐的風險

​這條《條例草案》第二個類別很值得提出來講解，就是如何減低物業欺詐的風險。有議員關注，在新制度下防範物業欺詐個案的機制如何執行。《條例草案》建議透過多項措施減低欺詐風險，包括註冊申請須附有由律師發出的核實證明書；向物業業主發出具有先進防偽特徵的業權證明書，這是由土地註冊處發出的；如果有人要向彌償基金索償，必須先向法庭提出更正令申請；另外我們提出的草案亦授權處長在有合理懷疑已有或將有物業欺詐的情況下作出限制令，禁止為物業作出相關註冊；以及我們亦指明如欺詐地遞交註冊申請或彌償申請，將干犯罪行等。

（三）更正及彌償的安排

第三方面是有關更正及彌償的安排。參考其他司法管轄區的安排，《條例草案》延續已制訂的《業權條例》，建議按「用者自付」原則成立自負盈虧的彌償基金，向因第三者欺詐而喪失業權的人士作出設有上限的彌償。政府建議對每宗物業轉移的代價款額設定0.014%的劃一徵費率，即每100萬元的物業價值須繳納140元徵費，上限為7,000元。此外，建議將彌償上限定為5,000萬元，預計超過99%的物業交易能獲全額保障。上述徵費和彌償只適用於將來根據業權註冊制度註冊的土地所涉的物業交易。而我們相對簡單易明的彌償率和徵費率，不對物業作出太多分類，這是法案委員會亦認同政府的政策方向。另外，《條例草案》建議，處長有權對業權註冊紀錄中的錯誤或遺漏作出更正，而法庭可因應業主申請，就錯誤、遺漏以及欺詐個案作出更正業權註冊紀錄的命令。

​因應議員的具體意見，政府就部分有關彌償條文提出修訂，我稍後會再作說明。

​至於申請更正及彌償的細節安排會在日後提交的附屬法例中訂明。土地註冊處將諮詢相關持份者，並在二○二六年提交立法會審議。

（四）宣傳和教育工作

第四方面關乎宣傳和教育工作。有議員關注律師在新制度下的責任，以及認為律師需調整他們在物業轉易過程中的現行做法及行為。《條例草案》建議，如律師在核實申請時真誠行事，並已作出合理努力，則無需為其在核實工作時造成的任何不準確之處所引致的任何損失，承擔損害賠償的法律責任。這關乎合理謹慎責任是普通法下廣泛沿用的標準，亦是目前律師處理物業轉易交易時須履行的標準。海外業權註冊制度的從業員履行核實責任時，亦採用類似的標準。土地註冊處已草擬相關指引以協助律師履行核實責任，亦會繼續與業界保持溝通以完善指引，提供清晰說明，協助法律界熟悉新制度的運作。

​法案委員會亦關注巿民對於新制度下「以冊為準」的認識，認為政府應加強與巿民及業界溝通。土地註冊處已與主要持份者成立專責的業權註冊教育委員會，統籌和督導公眾宣傳及專業教育活動。我們計劃在新制度實施前約半年開展宣傳及教育活動，並會在新制度實施後持續進行，確保公眾和業界有充分時間認識和熟習新制度的特點及運作模式。

查冊安排

​剛才有議員發言時提及業權註冊制度下的查冊安排，《條例草案》建議的查冊安排符合我們一貫原則，即在保障私隱、提供便捷的查冊服務，以及維持物業市場的透明及有效運作之間會取得平衡，並同時營造良好的營商環境，協助業界發展。公眾及業界可查閲資料以確定物業業權。詳細安排會在附屬法例中訂明，屆時我們會諮詢持份者並提交立法會審議。

現有土地的轉制

在討論中大家都很關注除了新批土地，現有土地何時才可實行業權註冊制度。政府通過先易後難方式，目的是希望這個制度可以早日落實。先行在新土地實施業權註冊制度，可讓各方累積實際經驗，有助敲定日後把業權註冊制度擴展至現有土地的安排。事實上，正如剛才有議員發言提到，新舊制度並行運作一段較長時間在海外司法管轄區亦屬常見。為達致將所有現有土地轉換至新制度的最終目標，其實我們也沒有等，土地註冊處已啓動內部研究，評估在現有290萬份土地登記冊中有問題的登記冊的範圍和類型，以便就轉制向發展局提出建議。政府計劃於明年開始與持份者商討可行的轉制方案，例如分階段轉制，先行轉換較近期批出的現有土地，又例如強制首次物業轉讓必須轉制、設立自願申請轉制等。我們希望探討後明年開始可與持份者作比較具體的諮詢，以期定出最切實可行的轉制方案。

主席，我懇請各位議員支持《條例草案》，以及我將於全體委員會審議階段提出的各項修正案。如《條例草案》獲得通過，政府計劃在明年向立法會提交六條附屬法例，涵蓋詳細的申請程序、費用及徵費、彌償基金、法院規則、電子遞交等事宜，按先訂立後審議的程序提交立法會，並與業界和公眾進行條例實施的籌備和宣傳教育工作，以便《條例草案》能在二○二七年上半年生效。

雖然今次這條例只適用於新土地，但正如很多議員指出，這是一個里程碑，是重要的一大步，而且很難得這一大步是政府、立法會以及各持份者包括法律界、銀行界、房地產界別等等同心合力走出來的一大步。我很多謝各位議員支持，亦多謝各位議員不吝嗇你們的發言，除了表示百分之二百以至百分之一千，甚至百分之萬二的支持，大家還點名讚賞我們的同事。其實坦白說，大家不吝嗇多說這幾句，對於整個政府團隊有很大鼓勵作用。我希望大家的鼓勵對於我們明年提交的附屬法例，以及明年再提出其他土地如何處理，有一個很大的鼓勵作用。

如果我們能夠盡快實施及通過今日建議的《條例草案》及其修訂，我們便會早日實現業權註冊制度的各項好處，為逐步擴展實施經修訂的《業權條例》打下重要基礎，實現香港土地註冊制度發展的新篇章。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government welcomed the announcement.

  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, said, ""As global investors' demand for RMB-denominated products grows, Hong Kong's role as a global offshore RMB business hub and risk management centre becomes increasingly important. With the strong support from our country, the HKSAR Government is committed to deepening and expanding mutual access between the Mainland and Hong Kong financial markets, continuously enriching RMB-denominated investment products and risk management tools to meet the needs of investors both domestically and internationally. The series of measures announced today by the PBoC, ranging from supporting overseas institutional investors in conducting repo business in the Mainland's bond market, expanding and optimising the Swap Connect mechanism and increasing its trading quota, supporting the Hong Kong market in providing more offshore RMB assets, to accelerating the listing of RMB treasury bond futures in Hong Kong, all provide strong support for our efforts and further promote the co-ordinated development of the fixed income markets in both places. We sincerely thank the Central People's Government and relevant authorities for the care and support for Hong Kong, and will continue to do our utmost to contribute greater efforts to our country's development into a financial powerhouse.""

  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""The issuance of RMB bonds in Hong Kong has increased year by year, exceeding RMB1 trillion in 2024. Since the implementation of Swap Connect in 2023, it has operated smoothly with steadily increasing business volume. The average daily notional principal amount traded in August 2025 reached RMB20 billion, an over five-fold increase from the first month of its launch in 2023. With increasing participation by offshore investors in the Mainland's bond market, demand for related risk management tools is growing. Enhancing the Swap Connect mechanism will further facilitate overseas investors in hedging risks in Mainland assets, thereby helping them better manage their portfolios. We will also communicate and work closely with relevant Mainland institutions to enrich the options of RMB products in Hong Kong and implement the launch of offshore treasury bond futures expeditiously. We are grateful to the Central People's Government and relevant Mainland regulators for their strong support.""

  Market institutions in both places will finalise the implementation details and announce the relevant launch dates."

LCQ6: Management of lifts of pedestrian walkway systems,2025-09-25 17:26,2025-09-25 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092501018.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Chan Han-pan and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

It is learnt that since the commissioning of the Lift and Pedestrian Walkway System between Castle Peak Road and Kung Yip Street, Kwai Chung, two lifts of one of the lift towers (i.e. the lift tower connecting Shek Lei (I) Estate and Castle Peak Road) break down quite often. As the closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) of these two lifts have not been equipped with camera devices, it was impossible to determine whether the breakdowns involved human factors, and it was only until several months ago that camera systems were installed after repeated requests by residents. Regarding the management of lifts of pedestrian walkway systems, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has examined the specific causes of the frequent breakdowns of the aforesaid two lifts, including whether they involved the quality issues of lifts;

(2) as it is learnt that in the past, CCTVs installed by the Highways Department at lifts of footbridges and subways were not equipped with camera devices, of the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are view that the Government should install CCTVs equipped with camera devices at the lifts of all pedestrian walkway systems under its purview to prevent crimes, whether the Government will gradually implement the relevant proposal; if so, of the details and timetable; if not, of the measures in place to prevent crimes occurring in lifts?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Highways Department (HyD) and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), my reply to various parts of the question raised by Dr the Hon Chan is as follows:

(1) To enhance the accessibility of hillside areas and facilitate public mobility, the Government constructs/installs a mix of pedestrian facilities, such as footbridges, subways, lifts, escalator links, etc, under the ""Hillside Escalator Links and Elevator Systems (HEL)"" projects to strengthen the pedestrian connectivity between uphill and downhill areas.

The Lift and Pedestrian Walkway System between Castle Peak Road and Kung Yip Street mentioned in the question was completed and commissioned in early 2024. During the initial stage of operation, two of the lifts experienced several malfunctions which primarily involved issues with lift door operation. The lift malfunctions necessitated suspension of service, causing inconvenience to the public, which was undesirable. Upon a thorough review by the HyD and the lift contractor, it was considered that most of the lift door malfunctions were caused by the accumulation of foreign objects. Subsequently, the HyD instructed the lift contractor to implement a series of measures, including conducting detailed re-inspections and tests on the lifts, replacing certain components, as well as enhancing the weekly routine inspection, repair and maintenance works, in particular stepping up the cleaning and sweeping of the lift door tracks and sensors. Over the past six months, there has been significant improvement in the performance of the lift operation. The HyD will continue to urge the contractor to perform thorough inspection and cleaning of the lifts to prevent further malfunctions of lift doors due to various factors such as accumulation of foreign objects.

To reduce the inconvenience to the public caused by suspension of service of lifts due to the malfunction under jurisdiction of the HyD, we believe that innovative technology can be applied to assist contractors in identifying problems at an early stage and enabling rectification of problems, thereby enhancing the reliability of lift services. Regarding the two lifts at the Lift and Pedestrian Walkway System between Castle Peak Road and Kung Yip Street, which are of concern to Dr the Hon Chan, the HyD, in co-ordination with EMSD, will introduce an intelligent predictive maintenance system to the lifts for remote collection of lift operation data to identify faults and analyse the severity of potential issues, thereby enabling fault prediction and preventive maintenance. Ultimately, this will reduce the frequency of lift malfunctions and the time required for maintenance. The HyD will also work with the EMSD to consider applying this technology to other lifts with higher malfunction rates, with a view to enhancing the overall quality of lift services at public walkways in Hong Kong.

(2) and (3) Currently, there are approximately 600 lifts installed in public pedestrian walkways under the jurisdiction of HyD. All of them are equipped with emergency alarm and communication systems in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Practice on the Design and Construction of Lifts and Escalators (the Code) published by the EMSD to ensure the personal safety of the public. If members of the public encounter an emergency situation inside a lift car, they may press the emergency alarm button to immediately notify the lift contractor's emergency communication centre, enabling the staff to provide prompt and appropriate assistance.

In addition, all the abovementioned lifts are equipped with closed-circuit television (CCTV) system together with the display of real-time footage from inside the lift cars on the screens installed on the external walls at the lift waiting areas in accordance with the Code. Should members of the public encounter an emergency inside the lift, rescue personnel and technicians can immediately assess the situation inside the lift cars through the display screens to provide assistance. Furthermore, the screens installed in lift waiting areas also allow the public to view the situation inside the lift cars in real time, thus enhancing the safety of members of public using the lifts, and, to a certain extent, helps prevent crimes from occurring inside the lifts.

To retrofit the approximately 600 lifts mentioned above with CCTVs with recording functions, the HyD has to carry out mechanical and electrical equipment upgrading works for all lifts including replacement of CCTVs, installation of relevant surveillance systems, connection of wiring and signals, to ensure compliance with the information technology security requirements. As the modification works will entail substantial additional costs and increase the recurrent maintenance costs in long term, the HyD must fully consider the cost-effectiveness when assessing whether to install the CCTV systems with recording functions at the lifts at all public footbridges/walkways in Hong Kong. We have also conducted preliminary research and found that according to HyD's records, there has not been any incidents of suspected criminal damages to lift facilities under the HyD's jurisdiction in recent years, while the more common non-human factors causing lift malfunctions (such as accumulation of foreign objects at lift doors, moisture affecting the components, signal system issues, wear and tear of components, etc) are difficult to be captured by CCTVs. Therefore, the use of CCTV systems with recording capabilities would be of limited assistance in identifying the causes of lift malfunctions. In fact, the lift contractors can generally identify the causes of lift malfunctions through on-site inspections without relying on CCTV footage. However, having heard Dr the Hon Chan's views on this matter, and as I mentioned in my earlier reply to the question, we hope to adopt innovative technology wherever possible. If an individual lift is found to have relatively higher malfunction rate, we are very willing to and proactive in introducing the intelligent predictive maintenance system to the lift to achieve a greater effectiveness in enhancing the quality of lift service. In light of the above considerations, we have no immediate plans to introduce CCTV systems with recording capabilities to the approximately 600 lifts at the public walkways throughout Hong Kong. Instead, we will actively utilise technological innovation. For instance, the intelligent predictive maintenance system can make use of AI and data storage to enable fault prediction and preventive maintenance, offering greater functionality.

Thank you, President."

  The Chairman of the SFC, Dr Kelvin Wong, said, ""As vital engines for global capital flows, Hong Kong's FIC markets are central to the city's international stature and long-term development. The Roadmap is poised to guide our market evolution that will benefit issuers, investors and intermediaries alike for years to come.""

  The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue,said, ""To position Hong Kong as a global FIC hub and further cement our position as the premier offshore RMB business centre, we will continue to build on our strengths, adapt to market changes and innovate, and capitalise on emerging trends, including RMB internationalisation and the digitalisation of the FIC market. The Roadmap comprehensively set out our work focuses in the near future. We look forward to implementing the initiatives in collaboration with industry stakeholders.""

立法會六題：行人通道系統升降機的管理,2025-09-25 16:44,2025-09-25 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500699.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上陳恒鑌議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

據悉「葵涌青山公路至工業街升降機及行人通道系統」自投入服務以來，其中一座升降機塔（即由石籬（一）邨至青山公路的升降機塔）的兩部升降機經常出現故障，由於該兩部升降機的閉路電視一直沒有裝設錄影裝置，以致無法確定故障是否涉及人為因素，直至數月前在居民的再三要求下才加裝錄影系統。關於行人通道系統升降機的管理，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否檢視上述兩部升降機頻繁出現故障的具體原因，包括是否涉及升降機的質量問題；

（二）據悉以往路政署在行人天橋及隧道的升降機所安裝的閉路電視並沒有附設錄影裝置，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，政府應在其轄下所有行人通道系統升降機安裝附設錄影裝置的閉路電視，以防範罪案發生，政府會否逐步落實有關建議；如會，詳情及時間表為何；如否，政府有何措施防範在升降機發生的罪案？

答覆：

主席：
    
就陳議員提問的各部分，經諮詢路政署及機電工程署，我現回覆如下：

（一）為提升上坡地區的易達性，便利市民出行，政府在上坡地區自動扶梯連接系統和升降機系統下建造／安裝行人天橋、隧道、升降機、自動扶梯系統等行人設施組合，加強上坡及下坡地區行人通道的連接。

問題提及的青山公路至工業街升降機及行人通道系統，於二○二四年年初落成啓用，其中兩部升降機在啓用初期曾出現數次故障，主要涉及升降機機門操作問題。升降機出現故障以致須停用，為市民帶來不便，情況並不理想。經路政署與升降機承辦商加緊檢視有關情況後，認為升降機機門故障大多是由外物積聚所致。其後，路政署指示升降機承辦商採取一系列措施，包括再次為升降機進行詳細檢查及測試、更換部分零件，以及加強升降機每周進行一次的例行檢查、維修及保養工作，尤其加強清洗及清掃升降機門軌及感應器等，過去半年升降機的運作情況已獲得顯著改善。路政署會繼續敦促承辦商做好升降機的檢查及清掃工作，避免升降機門再次因外物積聚等因素而出現故障。

為減少路政署轄下升降機出現問題而須停用，以致對市民造成不便，我們認為可以應用創新科技，協助承辦商及早發現問題，以適時作出修正，提升升降機服務的可靠性。就陳議員關注的青山公路至工業街升降機及行人通道系統的兩部升降機，路政署經與機電工程署協調後，將為其引入一套智能預測性維修保養系統，可以遙距收集升降機的運行數據，以識別故障並分析潛在問題的嚴重性，從而實現故障預報並作預防性維護，最終可減少發生故障的次數及縮短維修時間。路政署亦會聯同機電工程署考慮將有關科技應用於其他較多發生故障的升降機，以提升全港公共行人通道升降機的整體質素。

（二）及（三）現時路政署轄下的公共行人通道共設有約600部升降機，均已按照機電工程署《升降機及自動梯設計及構造實務守則》（《守則》）的要求，配備緊急警報及通訊系統，以確保市民的人身安全。如市民在升降機機廂內遇到緊急情況，可按動緊急警報按鈕即時通知升降機承辦商緊急通訊中心，以便職員迅速提供適當協助。

另外，上述升降機均根據《守則》配備閉路電視裝置，並於其等候區的外牆顯示屏展示升降機機廂內的實時影像。當市民在升降機內遇到緊急事故時，拯救人員及工程人員能透過顯示屏即時掌握升降機內的情況，為市民提供協助。此外，安裝於升降機等候區的顯示屏亦可供公眾即時察看升降機機廂内的情況，加強保障市民在乘搭有關升降機時的安全，在一定程度上有助防止罪案在升降機內發生。

若要為上述約600部升降機改為採用具備錄影功能的閉路電視系統，路政署須為所有升降機進行更換閉路電視、增設相關監察系統及接駁線路及信號等機電設備升級工程，以確保其符合資訊科技保安要求。由於有關改動工程會涉及大量額外的成本及增加長遠的經常性維修保養開支，路政署在考慮會否於全港的行人天橋／通道升降機內安裝具備錄影功能的閉路電視系統時須充分考慮其成本效益。我們亦已進行初步調研，根據路政署的紀錄，近年未曾發生懷疑有人刑事毀壞路政署轄下升降機設備的事故，而較常見造成升降機故障的非人為因素（例如外物積聚於升降機機門、機件受潮、訊號系統問題、部件出現耗損等），亦難以透過閉路電視拍攝，因此使用有錄影功能的閉路電視系統對協助找出升降機發生故障的原因作用不太彰顯。事實上，升降機承辦商一般可透過現場檢查找出升降機發生故障的原因，無需依賴閉路電視錄像。不過，聽到陳議員在這方面的意見，亦在我剛才的問題答覆所述，我們希望盡量採取科技創新，如個別升降機較多發生故障，我們很樂意及積極為其引入智能預測性維修保養系統，以達至提升升降機服務質素的更佳效果。基於上述考慮，我們暫不計劃於全港公共行人通道約600部升降機，引入具錄影功能的閉路電視系統，但反之，我們會積極地利用科技創新，而當中的智能預測性維修保養系統，正正可以引用AI（人工智能）及數據儲存作出預防性的故障預報及作預防性維護，這帶來的功能更大。

多謝主席。"

根據政府統計處今日（九月二十五日）公布的數字，在統計調查中包括的所有選定行業主類，以名義工資指數計算，二零二五年六月的平均工資率較上年同期上升3.5%。

在二零二五年六月，約62%公司的平均工資率較上年同期上升，33%公司的平均工資率較上年同期下跌，其餘5%公司的平均工資率與上年同期相若。

扣除以甲類消費物價指數計算的消費物價變動的因素後，在統計調查中包括的所有選定行業主類，二零二五年六月的實質平均工資率較上年同期上升1.4%。

薪金總額統計方面，在統計調查中包括的所有行業主類，二零二五年第二季的就業人士名義平均薪金指數較上年同期上升3.6%。

扣除以綜合消費物價指數計算的消費物價變動的因素後，二零二五年第二季的就業人士實質平均薪金較上年同期上升1.8%。

工資率包括基本工資及其他經常性及保證發放的津貼及花紅。薪金總額除包括工資率的組成部分外，還包括發放給員工的其他非經常性薪酬開支，例如非固定發放的花紅和超時工作津貼。因此，薪金總額統計數字的按季變動，會受實際工作時數及支付花紅和補薪的時間所影響，而出現較大變動。

名義工資指數方面，在二零二五年六月，所有選定行業主類均錄得按年升幅，由2.9%至4.9%不等。

實質工資指數方面，在二零二五年六月，所有選定行業主類亦錄得按年升幅，由0.8%至2.7%不等。

表1載列了二零二四年六月至二零二五年六月各選定行業主類的名義及實質工資指數的按年變動。

就業人士名義平均薪金指數方面，在二零二五年第二季，所有選定行業主類均錄得按年升幅，由1.8%至10.9%不等。

實質平均薪金指數方面，在二零二五年第二季，除零售業與上年同期比較維持大致不變外，其他選定行業主類均錄得按年升幅，由1.1%至9.0%不等。

表2載列了二零二四年第二季至二零二五年第二季各選定行業主類就業人士名義及實質平均薪金指數的按年變動。同期經季節性調整的就業人士名義及實質平均薪金指數的按季變動列於表3。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第二季的名義和實質工資和勞工收入按年均繼續上升。選定行業的平均工資率和就業人士的平均薪金普遍錄得升幅。

展望未來，香港經濟穩定增長應繼續為勞工需求，以致工資和勞工收入提供支持，儘管一些行業的經營狀況可能仍會面對壓力。

其他資料

工資指數及就業人士平均薪金指數是根據政府統計處按季進行的「勞工收入統計調查」結果而編製。工資指數只涵蓋督導級及以下的僱員（即不包括經理級與專業僱員），而就業人士平均薪金指數則涵蓋各階層的僱員，及經常參與機構單位業務的在職東主。

除僱員涵蓋範圍不同外，工資統計在概念上與薪金總額統計有所不同。首先，工資率指僱員在正常工作時間內賺取的款項，包括基本工資及其他經常性及保證發放的津貼及花紅，但不包括超時工作所得的收入及非固定發放的花紅，而有關款項則計算在就業人士平均薪金總額內。其次，各行業的就業人士平均薪金指數是該行業所有就業人士賺取的收入的平均數，因此，指數變動會受工資率、工作時數及該行業職業結構轉變的影響。相反，各行業的工資指數則是把接連兩次統計期的職業結構保持不變，只純粹反映工資率的變動。換言之，工資指數反映勞工價格的變動。由於薪金總額統計與工資統計在概念上及點算上均有所不同，就業人士平均薪金指數與工資指數的變動不一定一致。

讀者亦應注意，實質工資指數與就業人士實質平均薪金指數是根據不同的消費物價指數而編製的，以配合該兩項指數所分別涵蓋的職業範圍。具體來說，綜合消費物價指數作為總體消費物價指數，是適用於涵蓋所有職業階層員工的薪金總額的平減物價指數。至於甲類消費物價指數，作為較低開支組別的消費物價指數，則適用於涵蓋督導級及以下職業階層僱員的工資的平減物價指數。

薪金總額及工資統計的詳細分項數字載在二零二五年六月份《工資及薪金總額按季統計報告》內。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1050009&scode=210）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that the value of merchandise exports grew visibly further by 14.5% in August over a year earlier. Exports to the Mainland and most other Asian markets continued to post solid growth, and exports to the United States and the European Union turned to increases. Meanwhile, exports of most major commodities also showed growth, in particular for exports of electrical equipment, machinery and mechanical appliances which sustained a strong performance.

Looking ahead, sustained economic growth in Asia in particular the Mainland, together with Hong Kong's enhanced economic and trade ties with different markets, should continue to provide support to Hong Kong's merchandise trade performance. Yet, the United States' trade policy will continue to affect the near-term outlook of international trade flows. The Government will monitor the situation closely and stay vigilant.

Wage and payroll statistics for June 2025,2025-09-25 16:30,2025-09-25 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500664.htm,"Overall wage and payroll statistics

According to the figures released today (September 25) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the average wage rate for all the selected industry sections surveyed, as measured by the wage index, increased by 3.5% in nominal terms in June 2025 over a year earlier.

About 62% of the companies reported increase in average wage rates in June 2025 compared with a year ago. A total of 33% of the companies recorded decrease in average wage rates over the same period. The remaining 5% reported virtually no change in average wage rates.

After discounting the changes in consumer prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index (A), the overall average wage rate for all the selected industry sections surveyed increased by 1.4% in real terms in June 2025 over a year earlier.

As for payroll, the index of payroll per person engaged for all the industry sections surveyed increased by 3.6% in nominal terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier.

After discounting the changes in consumer prices as measured by the Composite Consumer Price Index, the average payroll per person engaged increased by 1.8% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 compared with a year earlier.

The wage rate includes basic wages and other regular and guaranteed allowances and bonuses. Payroll includes elements covered by wage rate as well as other irregular payments to workers such as discretionary bonuses and overtime allowances. The payroll statistics therefore tend to show relatively larger quarter-to-quarter changes, affected by the number of hours actually worked and the timing of payment of bonuses and back-pay.

Sectoral changes

For the nominal wage indices, year-on-year increases were recorded in all selected industry sections in June 2025, ranging from 2.9% to 4.9%.

For the real wage indices, year-on-year increases were also recorded in all selected industry sections in June 2025, ranging from 0.8% to 2.7%.

The year-on-year changes in the nominal and real wage indices for the selected industry sections from June 2024 to June 2025 are shown in Table 1.

As for the nominal indices of payroll per person engaged, year-on-year increases were recorded in all selected industry sections in the second quarter of 2025, ranging from 1.8% to 10.9%.

For the real payroll indices, year-on-year increases were recorded in all selected industry sections surveyed in the second quarter of 2025, ranging from 1.1% to 9.0%, except the retail trade section which remained virtually unchanged.

The year-on-year changes in the nominal and real indices of payroll per person engaged for selected industry sections from the second quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2025 are shown in Table 2. The quarterly changes in the seasonally adjusted nominal and real indices of payroll per person engaged in the same period are shown in Table 3.

Commentary

A Government spokesman said that wages and labour earnings continued to rise in both nominal and real terms in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. Increases were generally seen in the average wage rate and payroll per person engaged across selected industries.

Looking ahead, the steady growth of the Hong Kong economy should continue to provide support to labour demand, and thus wages and labour earnings, though the operating environment of some industries may remain under pressure.

Other information

Both wage indices and payroll indices are compiled quarterly based on the results of the Labour Earnings Survey (LES) conducted by theC&SD. Wage index only covers employees up to the supervisory level (i.e. not including managerial and professional employees), whereas payroll index covers employees at all levels and proprietors actively engaged in the work of the establishment.

Apart from the differences in employee coverage, wage statistics are conceptually different from the payroll statistics. Firstly, wage rate for an employee refers to the sum earned for his normal hours of work. It covers basic wages and other regular and guaranteed allowances and bonuses, but excludes earnings from overtime work and discretionary bonuses, which are however included in payroll per person engaged. Secondly, the payroll index of an industry is an indicator of the simple average payroll received per person engaged in the industry. Its movement is therefore affected by changes in wage rates, number of hours of work and occupational composition in the industry. In contrast, the wage index of an industry is devised to reflect the pure changes in wage rate, with the occupational composition between two successive statistical periods being kept unchanged. In other words, the wage index reflects the change in the price of labour. Because of these conceptual and enumeration differences between payroll and wage statistics, the movements in payroll indices and in wage indices do not necessarily match closely with each other.

It should also be noted that different consumer price indices are used for compiling the real indices of wage and payroll to take into account the differences in their respective occupation coverage. Specifically, the Composite Consumer Price Index, being an indicator of overall consumer prices, is taken as the price deflator for payroll of workers at all levels of the occupational hierarchy. The Consumer Price Index (A), being an indicator of consumer prices for the relatively low expenditure group, is taken as the price deflator for wages in respect of employees engaged in occupations up to the supervisory level.

Detailed breakdowns of the payroll and wage statistics are published in the ""Quarterly Report of Wage and Payroll Statistics, June 2025"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of theC&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1050009&scode=210).

立法會十四題：打擊冒充新鮮雞出售的行為,2025-09-25 15:30,2025-09-25 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500657.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上何俊賢議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

據悉由於新鮮屠宰雞隻（俗稱新鮮雞）與冰鮮雞的外觀差異較小，但因售價差別較大，並且可在同一地方銷售，導致出現不法商户以冰鮮雞冒充新鮮雞出售的情況。有意見認為該情況不但引發食物安全問題，亦對本地養雞業造成衝擊。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）現時全港各區可出售（i）新鮮雞、（ii）冰鮮雞及（iii）兩者均可的持牌新鮮糧食店及街市檔位的分布為何；

（二）過去五年，每年全港活雞屠宰點及零售點在各區的數量變化，以及本地活雞的價格變化分別為何，並按月份列出分項數字；

（三）鑑於有業內人士反映，部分商家將已拆開包裝的冰鮮雞，甚或雪藏雞冒充新鮮雞出售以誤導消費者，就打擊上述違規情況，食物環境衞生署（食環署）人員每月的巡查次數、負責巡查的人手安排，以及抽檢樣本數量分別為何；食環署有否在巡查時發現有商家以非新鮮雞肉冒充新鮮雞出售的行為；如有，當局透過何種方式發現該等情況，以及相關檢測方式分別為何；

（四）據悉不同於新鮮豬肉與冰鮮豬肉不可在同一處所售賣的限制，現時同一處所可同時申請銷售新鮮雞及冰鮮雞的牌照，令冒充新鮮雞出售行為的舉證及檢控難度更大，過去五年，每年食環署（i）接獲有關以冰鮮雞冒充新鮮雞出售的舉報數目、（ii）對違反《食物業規例》（第132X章）和《商品說明條例》（第362章）的經營者提出檢控的個案宗數和被定罪人士的判罰，以及（iii）當時允許在同一處所售賣新鮮雞及冰鮮雞的立法考量，以及新鮮雞與新鮮豬肉的銷售安排有所區別的原因；及

（五）長遠而言，當局會否採用多管齊下的方式解決有關問題，例如採取「放蛇」行動、增加新鮮雞零售點數量，以及要求強制分區銷售新鮮雞和冰鮮雞，以便利消費者辨識和加強食環署有效監管新鮮雞的銷售？

答覆：

主席：

食物環境衞生署（食環署）一直致力打擊以冰鮮肉充當新鮮肉出售的情況。以冰鮮或冷藏肉充當新鮮肉出售，除了違反持牌條件，更可能會引起食物安全問題。任何人士未經食環署的檢驗證明和批核而售賣冰鮮肉或冷藏肉即屬違法。食環署會定期巡查持牌新鮮糧食店和街市肉檔，也會積極處理接獲的投訴。此外，食環署亦會不時主動偵查懷疑違規個案，以及按需要進行突擊巡查及執法行動。如有足夠證據，會提出檢控，並就違反相關持牌條件或街市租約條款作出跟進，包括取消牌照和終止街市租約。

就何俊賢議員提問的各部分，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局，現回覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年八月底，全港各區可出售新鮮雞、冰鮮雞和兩者均可的持牌新鮮糧食店和街市檔位的數目見附件一。

（二）過去五年，全港活雞屠宰點和銷售點在各區的分布見附件二，本地活雞的價格變化見附件三。

（三）根據新鮮糧食店牌照條件和食環署街市攤檔租約條款，進口冰鮮雞須預先包裝並按照《食物及藥物（成分組合及標籤）規例》（第132W章）加上標籤，以原有完整無缺的預先包裝形式出售。除了須把冰鮮雞貯存於攝氏0度至4度，商戶亦須在當眼處展示告示標明「本店有售進口冰鮮家禽」。

食環署在巡查時，會檢查雞隻包裝、儲存方式及溫度、核對採購發票資料、查驗店鋪存貨等，以作綜合評估。在二○二○年至二○二五年至八月三十一日期間，食環署每年定期巡查新鮮糧食店和可出售家禽的公眾街市攤檔的次數表列如下。食環署並無備存巡查只獲准售冰鮮雞的新鮮糧食店的分項數字。

食環署每月巡查次數和人手調配會因應實際運作需要而有所調整。




年份
巡查次數


二○二○年
約6 500


二○二一年
約6 900


二○二二年
約7 300


二○二三年
約7 000


二○二四年
約6 600


二○二五年（至八月三十一日）
約4 400




（四）在二○二○年至二○二五年八月三十一日期間，食環署共接獲12宗有關以冰鮮雞冒充新鮮雞出售的投訴個案。同期，香港海關共接獲11宗有關以冰鮮雞冒充新鮮雞出售的懷疑涉及違反《商品說明條例》的舉報。兩個部門已根據相關條例完成有關調查，並作出適當跟進。

至於豬肉方面，現時售賣新鮮豬肉的新鮮糧食店和街市攤檔在取得相關批註後，可同時售賣預先包裝和加上妥善標籤的冷凍豬肉。這安排與出售新鮮雞和冰鮮雞的要求基本一致，目的是在防止肉類混雜銷售的同時，也顧及業界的經營需要。如上文所述，食環署一向高度關注肉類混雜銷售的情況，無論是涉及豬肉或雞肉，署方均會就違規行為，即時採取執管行動。

（五）食環署會繼續以多管齊下的方式進行監管，包括定期巡查、因應投訴或其他渠道收集到的資料及情報作出調查、主動偵查懷疑違規個案，以及按需要進行突擊巡查，以打擊以冰鮮雞冒充新鮮雞出售的違規行為。此外，食環署會嚴格檢查新鮮糧食店牌照條件和食環署街市攤檔有否有遵從在進口冰鮮雞的包裝上加上標籤，以及在當眼處展示告示標明「本店有售進口冰鮮家禽」的要求，以便利消費者辨識。

至於增加活家禽銷售點方面，食環署已於興建中的將軍澳第67區和古洞北新發展區的新公眾街市加入適量的活家禽攤檔。此外，食環署今年三月把旺角區大角咀街市內一個已採用櫥窗售賣方式設計的空置活家禽攤檔推出作公開競投，令食環署公眾街市的活家禽攤檔數目增至85個。公眾街市內新設的活家禽攤檔須採用嚴謹衞生規格的櫥窗售賣方式設計，內設專用屠宰室，可完全分隔購買者與活家禽，並設有獨立空調、抽氣及空氣過濾系統，確保衞生。"
LCQ14: Cracking down on act of selling counterfeit fresh chickens,2025-09-25 15:30,2025-09-25 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500701.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Steven Ho and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

It is learnt that due to the minor visual differences between freshly slaughtered chickens (commonly known as fresh chickens) and chilled chickens, coupled with the significant price difference and the fact that both can be sold at the same premises, some unscrupulous traders have been selling chilled chickens as fresh chickens. There are views that this not only causes food safety problems, but also deals a blow to the local chicken rearing industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current distribution of licensed fresh provision shops and market stalls in various districts across the territory that are permitted to sell (i) fresh chickens, (ii) chilled chickens, or (iii) both;

(2) of the respective changes in the number of locations for slaughtering live chickens and retail outlets, and in the price of local live chickens, in various districts across the territory in each of the past five years, together with a breakdown by month;

(3) as some members of the industry have relayed that some traders mislead consumers by selling chilled or even frozen chickens removed from their packaging as fresh chickens, of the number of monthly inspections conducted by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) officers to combat such non-compliance, the staffing arrangements for these inspections, and the number of samples taken for testing; whether the FEHD has detected any cases of traders passing off non-fresh chickens as fresh for sale during inspections; if so, how these cases were detected by the authorities and what the respective testing methods were;

(4) as it is learnt that, unlike the restriction prohibiting the sale of fresh and chilled pork at the same premises, applications for licences to sell both fresh and chilled chickens at the same premises can currently be made, making it more difficult to prove and prosecute cases of passing off chilled chickens as fresh chickens, of (i) the number of reports on traders selling chilled chickens as fresh chickens received, (ii) the respective numbers of prosecutions instituted against operators for breaching the Food Business Regulation (Cap. 132X) and the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap. 362), by the FEHD in each of the past five years, and the punishments imposed on those convicted; and (iii) the legislative considerations at the time allowing the sale of both fresh and chilled chickens at the same premises, as well as the reasons for the difference in the sales arrangements for fresh chickens and fresh pork; and

(5) whether, in the long run, the authorities will adopt a multi-pronged approach to address the relevant issues, such as conducting decoy operations, increasing the number of retail outlets for fresh chickens, and mandating separation zoning for the sale of fresh and chilled chickens, so as to facilitate consumer identification and enhance the effectiveness of the FEHD in regulating the sale of fresh chickens?

Reply:

President,

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has long been committed to combating the sale of chilled or frozen meat disguised as fresh meat. The selling of chilled or frozen meat as fresh meat not only breaches licensing conditions, but may also pose food safety risks. Any person selling chilled or frozen meat without the FEHD's inspection certificate and permit commits an offence. The FEHD conducts regular inspections at licensed fresh provision shops and market meat stalls, and handle complaints actively. In addition, the department investigates suspected violations proactively and would conduct surprise inspections and take enforcement actions as necessary. When sufficient evidence is found, prosecutions will be initiated and follow-up actions will be taken in regards to breaches of relevant licensing conditions or market tenancy terms, including licence cancellation and termination of market tenancy.

  In response to the various parts of the Hon Steven Ho's question, in consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, our replies are as follows:

(1) As of the end of August 2025, the number of licensed fresh provision shops and market stalls permitted to sell fresh chicken, chilled chicken, or both, broken down by district, is provided in Annex I.

(2) Over the past five years, the distribution of live chicken slaughtering and retail outlets across districts is set out in Annex II, while changes in local live chicken prices are shown in Annex III.

(3) Under the licensing conditions for fresh provision shops and tenancy agreements for the FEHD market stalls, imported chilled chicken must be pre-packaged and labelled in accordance with the Food and Drugs (Composition and Labelling) Regulations (Cap. 132W), and must be sold in its original and intact pre-packaged form. In addition to storing the chilled chicken at 0°C to 4°C, stalls must display a notice stating ""Imported Chilled Poultry for Sale"" at prominent locations.

  During inspections, the FEHD will check the packaging, storage method and temperature of chickens, the purchase invoices and shop inventory, etc, for a comprehensive assessment. From 2020 to August 31, 2025, the number of the FEHD's regular inspections at fresh provision shops and market stalls permitted to sell poultry is tabulated by year below. The FEHD does not keep separate statistics for inspections at shops permitted to sell chilled chicken only.

  The FEHD adjusts the number of inspections and staffing arrangements each month according to operational needs.




Year
Number of Inspections


2020
About 6 500


2021
About 6 900


2022
About 7 300


2023
About 7 000


2024
About 6 600


2025 (up to August 31)
About 4 400




(4) From 2020 to August 31, 2025, the FEHD received 12 complaints about chilled chicken disguised as fresh chickens, and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department received 11 complaints regarding potential contravention of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance by selling chilled chicken as fresh chickens. Both departments completed investigations according to relevant ordinances and took appropriate follow-up action.

  As for pork, under the current arrangement, licensed fresh provision shops and market stalls selling fresh pork may, after obtaining relevant endorsements, also sell properly labelled, pre-packaged chilled pork. This arrangement basically aligns with the requirements for selling fresh and chilled chicken; the aim is to prevent mixed sales of meat while taking into account the needs of the trade. As mentioned above, the FEHD has always paid close attention to the issue of mixed meat sales. The department will immediately take enforcement action against any irregularities detected no matter it is pork or chicken that is involved.

(5) The FEHD will continue to combat the sales of chilled chicken as fresh through multiple methods, including regular inspections, investigations on complaints or based on intelligence, proactive investigations on suspected violations and conduct surprise inspections as necessary. In addition, the FEHD will check for strict compliance with licence conditions and tenancy agreements regarding chilled chicken packaging and labelling, as well as the display of notices printed with ""Imported Chilled Poultry for Sale"" to facilitate identification by consumers.

  Regarding increasing live poultry sales points, the FEHD has included an appropriate number of live poultry stalls in the new public markets under construction in Area 67, Tseung Kwan O, and Kwu Tung North New Development Area. Moreover, in March this year, the FEHD auctioned a live poultry stall with display-window design in Tai Kok Tsui Market in Mong Kok District, raising the total number of live poultry stalls in public markets under the FEHD to 85. The new live poultry stalls in public markets must adopt designs with stringent hygiene standards, featuring display window for sale purposes. These stalls must be equipped with dedicated slaughtering rooms, allowing complete separation between buyers and live poultry. In addition, they are outfitted with independent air conditioning, ventilation and air filtration systems to ensure good hygiene conditions."
立法會十八題：百分百擔保特惠貸款,2025-09-25 14:50,2025-09-25 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500862.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上梁熙議員的提問和署理商務及經濟發展局局長陳百里博士的書面答覆：

問題：

有關「百分百擔保特惠貸款」（特惠貸款），政府可否告知本會：

（一）特惠貸款下的「八成信貸擔保產品」、「九成信貸擔保產品」和「百分百特別擔保產品」由設立至今，每年的壞帳率，以及當局最新的壞帳貸款擔保額分別為何；

（二）有否統計，特惠貸款下涉及壞帳的公司當中，有多少間同時有申請破產欠薪保障基金（破欠基金），以及其所佔比率分別為何；當局有否調查該等濫用特惠貸款和破欠基金的情況，以及有否研究有何措施以避免破欠基金被濫用；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（三）有否統計，相關公司在開始償還特惠貸款後，首一個月、兩至三個月、四至五個月，以及半年或以上的壞帳及申請破產數字分別為何；及

（四）就涉及壞帳及破產的企業，當局有否調查該等個案是否涉及資產轉移；如有調查，當局有否作出檢控，以及相關個案的詳情為何；如沒有調查，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府自二○一二年起透過「中小企融資擔保計劃」（計劃）提供信貸擔保，協助中小企業獲得商業貸款，並持續推出優化措施，以切合中小企業在經濟下行期間的融資需要。計劃下的百分百特別擔保產品的申請期已於二○二四年三月底結束。

就問題的四個部分，經諮詢財經事務及庫務局和勞工處後，現回覆如下：

（一）計劃下各項擔保產品的壞帳率和壞帳貸款擔保額以累積計算。截至二○二五年八月底，八成、九成和百分百特別擔保產品的累計壞帳貸款擔保額分別約為54億元、12億元和255億元，而累計壞帳率分別約為5.4%、4.5%和17.7%，低於假設整體壞帳率（分別為12%、16%和25%）。壞帳率會視乎整體經濟環境和個別借款企業的經營情況等因素而有所改變。政府和負責執行和管理計劃的香港按證保險有限公司（按證保險公司）會繼續密切監察情況。

（二）破產欠薪保障基金（破欠基金）根據《破產欠薪保障條例》（第380章）（條例）設立，目的是當僱主結業及無力償還欠款予僱員時，向僱員發放特惠款項以提供適時經濟援助，讓他們無須等待冗長的僱主破產／清盤程序完結，及早獲得被拖欠的工資、未放年假薪酬及未放法定假日薪酬、代通知金及／或遣散費。政府高度重視涉嫌濫用破欠基金的情況，並已成立跨部門專責小組，成員包括勞工處、警務處商業罪案調查科及破產管理署的代表，加強主動偵查可疑個案。勞工處嚴謹審批及緊密跟進每宗破欠基金申請。如發現公司負責人涉嫌非法轉移資產、盜竊公款、藉欺騙手段逃避債務、沒有妥善備存公司帳目等，勞工處會將案件轉交警務處及／或破產管理署跟進。在處理由僱員提出的破欠基金申請時，勞工處審核僱員的僱傭及工資紀錄。由於破欠基金和計劃兩者的目的和受惠對象不同，勞工處無須考慮相關僱主是否計劃下的借款企業；而貸款機構在對借款企業採取追討／法律行動期間，亦不會考慮其僱員有否同時對借款企業採取追討欠薪行動及／或申請破欠基金。

（三）截至二○二五年八月底，以借款企業違約出現時間計算的累計宗數如下：




違約出現時間
			（自貸款開始／提取日到違約日計算）
八成
			擔保產品
九成
			擔保產品
百分百特別擔保產品


（i）不多於180天

			（3.1%）


（ii）181天至一年

總數
2 319
			（100%）
1 209
			（100%）
11 880
			（100%）




截至二○二五年八月底，就八成／九成和百分百特別擔保產品，貸款機構正分別就1784宗和11220宗壞帳個案採取追討行動，當中1130宗和2860宗個案的擔保人已被展開破產程序或被法院頒出破產令，並已經或正就當中1162宗和2454宗個案進行清盤／其他法律行動。

（四）按證保險公司一直與貸款機構緊密合作，致力妥善處理違約個案。如借款企業拖欠還款，貸款機構會先與借款企業商討可行的還款方案，例如在過渡期內只償還利息或部分本金，以期借款企業可盡快在債務重整安排下繼續營運，並逐步恢復正常還款。與此同時，貸款機構會了解借款企業及擔保人的資產狀況。如貸款機構未能與借款企業達成還款協議或借款企業拒絕合作，或發現資產轉移，貸款機構會按其政策及商業慣例，考慮採取合適的追討／法律行動，包括要求企業及擔保人償還相關貸款、向法院申請判令及後續行動（例如向法庭申請押記令，避免企業或擔保人透過物業轉移資產逃避還款責任）、向法院提交清盤呈請及／或破產呈請等，務求減低政府的損失。

現行破產和清盤的法定程序及相關法例已有效把關，打擊債務人和債務公司以欺詐方法轉移資產，不論個案是否涉及計劃下的壞帳，有關欺詐行為均會觸犯《破產條例》（第6章）或《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》（第32章）。

在破產案和清盤案中，負責管理案件的受託人和清盤人會調查債務人及債務公司的事務，包括其在破產或清盤前有否作出任何不公平的優惠、以低於一般價值而訂立的交易、或不當地處置其所有資產。就有關不當的資產處置，受託人和清盤人會採取適當的行動追討相關資產。根據《破產條例》和《公司（清盤及雜項條文）條例》，受託人和清盤人如發現債務人或債務公司的人員涉嫌以欺詐方法轉移任何財產，須把有關證據交予破產管理署考慮跟進。如證據充分，債務人或債務公司的人員會按相關條例被檢控，一經定罪，最高可判監禁兩年。"
LCQ18: Special 100% Loan Guarantee,2025-09-25 14:50,2025-09-25 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500864.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Edward Leung and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Dr Bernard Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 Regarding the Special 100% Loan Guarantee (Special Loan), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective default rates of the 80% Guarantee Product, the 90% ‍Guarantee Product and the Special 100% Guarantee Product under the Special Loan in each year since their establishment, and the latest loan guarantee amount of default cases undertaken by the authorities;

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of companies involved in default cases under the Special Loan that have also applied for the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (PWIF), and the percentage they account for; whether the authorities have investigated such cases of abuse of the Special Loan and PWIF, and whether they have studied measures to prevent abuse of the PWIF; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of default cases and bankruptcy applications for relevant companies in the first month, the second to third months, the fourth to fifth months, and six months or more after they commenced repayment of the Special Loan; and

(4) regarding enterprises involved in default cases and bankruptcy, whether the authorities have investigated if such cases involved transfer of assets; if investigations were conducted, whether prosecutions have been instituted and of the details of the relevant cases; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been providing loan guarantees through the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS) since 2012 to help small and medium enterprises obtain commercial loans, and kept on introducing enhancement measures to meet the financing needs of SMEs during economic downturn. The application period of the Special 100% Guarantee Product under the SFGS ended in end-March 2024.

 Having consulted the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau and the Labour Department (LD), the reply to the four parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The default rates and loan guarantee amounts of default cases of various guarantee products under the SFGS are calculated on a cumulative basis. As at end-August 2025, the cumulative loan guarantee amounts of default cases of the 80%, 90% and Special 100% Guarantee Products were about $5.4billion, $1.2 billion and $25.5 billion respectively, and the cumulative default rates were about 5.4 per cent, 4.5 per cent and 17.7 per cent respectively, lower than the assumed overall default rates (12 per cent, 16 per cent and 25 per cent respectively). The default rates are subject to change having regard to the overall economic environment, and the operational situation of individual borrowing enterprises, etc. The Government and the HKMC Insurance Limited (HKMCI), which is responsible for administering and managing the SFGS, will continue to monitor the situation closely.

(2) Established under the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Ordinance (Cap.380), the Protection of Wages on Insolvency Fund (PWIF) aims to provide timely financial relief in the form of ex gratia payment to employees in the event of business closure of their insolvent employers, which saves them from waiting for the completion of lengthy bankruptcy/winding-up proceedings of their employers to promptly recover arrears in wages, pay for untaken annual leave, pay for untaken statutory holidays, wages in lieu of notice and/or severance payment being owed. The Government takes a serious view on suspected abuses of the PWIF, and has set up an inter-departmental Task Force comprising representatives from the LD, the Commercial Crime Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force (the Police) and the Official Receiver's Office (ORO) to strengthen proactive investigation of suspicious cases. The LD rigorously verifies and closely monitors every application to the PWIF. If the company responsible persons are suspected of illegal transfer of assets, theft of company money, evasion of liabilities by deception, failure to keep proper accounting records, etc., the LD will refer such cases to the Police and/or the ORO for follow-up. When processing the PWIF applications made by employees, the LD examines the employment and wages records of employees. Since the objectives and the beneficiaries of the PWIF and the SFGS are different, the LD does not need to consider whether the relevant employers are borrowing enterprises under the SFGS, while the lending institutions, during the course of taking recovery/legal actions against the borrowing enterprises, do not consider whether the employees of the borrowing enterprises are simultaneously taking actions against the enterprises to recover their wages and/or applying for the PWIF.

(3) As at end-August 2025, the cumulative number of delinquent cases calculated based on the time of occurrence of delinquency of borrowing enterprises is as follows:



Time of occurrence of delinquency
			(calculated from the loan starting/drawdown date to the date of delinquency)
80% Guarantee Product
90% Guarantee Product
Special 100% Guarantee Product


(i) Not more than 180 days
151
			(6.5%)
109
			(9%)
374
			(3.1%)


(ii) 181 days to one year
325
			(14.0%)
288
			(23.8%)
1 386
			(11.7%)


(iii) More than one year
1 843
			(79.5%)
812
			(67.2%)

			(85.2%)


Total
2 319
			(100%)
1 209
			(100%)
11 880
			(100%)




 As at end-August 2025, in respect of the 80%/90% Guarantee Products and the Special 100% Guarantee Product, lending institutions have been taking recovery actions against 1784 and 11220 default cases respectively. Among them, bankruptcy proceedings have been commenced or bankruptcy orders had been granted by the court against the guarantors in 1130 and 2860 cases, and liquidation/other legal actions have been/are being taken in 1162 and 2454 cases respectively.

(4) The HKMCI has been working closely with lending institutions on properly handling delinquent cases. In the event that a borrowing enterprise defaults on repayments, the lending institution will first discuss a feasible repayment plan with the borrowing enterprise, e.g. repaying only the interest or part of the principal during a transition period, so that the borrowing enterprise can continue its operation while making a debt restructuring arrangement as soon as possible, with a view to gradually resuming normal repayments. At the same time, lending institutions will review the asset status of the borrowing enterprises and the guarantors. If the lending institution and the borrowing enterprise could not reach agreement on the repayment or the latter refuses to co-operate, or transfer of assets are identified, the lending institution will consider taking appropriate recovery/legal actions in accordance with its policy and prevailing commercial practice, including requesting the enterprise and guarantor to repay the loan, applying to the court for an order and other follow-up actions (e.g. apply to the court for charging orders to prevent enterprises or guarantors from evading repayment obligations by transferring real estate properties), filing a petition for winding-up and/or bankruptcy with the court, etc. with a view to reducing the loss of the Government.

 The existing statutory procedures and relevant legislation in respect of bankruptcy and winding-up proceedings have provided effective safeguards against fraudulent transfer of assets by debtors and debtor companies. Regardless of whether a case involves defaults under the SFGS, such fraudulent acts are in breach of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap. 6) or the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32).

  In bankruptcy and winding-up cases, the trustees and liquidators responsible for case administration will investigate the affairs of the debtors and debtor companies, including whether there were any unfair preferences given, transactions at an undervalue or improper disposals of assets prior to the bankruptcy or winding-up. In cases of improper disposals of assets, appropriate actions will be taken by the trustees and liquidators to recover the relevant assets. Under the Bankruptcy Ordinance and the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, where the trustees or liquidators discover that a debtor or an officer of a debtor company is suspected of having fraudulently transferred any property, they shall provide the ORO with the relevant evidence for consideration and follow-up. If sufficient evidence is available, the debtor or the officer of the debtor company will be prosecuted in accordance with the relevant ordinance, and upon conviction, is liable to imprisonment for up to two years."

Government invites market to submit expressions of interest for development of green maritime fuel storage facilities in Tsing Yi South,2025-09-25 14:35,2025-09-25 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500691.htm,"The Transport and Logistics Bureau (TLB) today (September 25) invites relevant industry players to submit expressions of interest (EOI) for the development of green maritime fuel storage facilities on a site in Tsing Yi South.

In order to meet the decarbonisation target for international shipping set by the International Maritime Organization, of which Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is an associate member, the HKSAR Government promulgated the Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering in November 2024, setting out clear targets, strategies and actions to develop Hong Kong into a green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre. One of the measures set out in the Action Plan is to prepare a coastal site identified in Tsing Yi South for green maritime fuel storage. As such, as mentioned in the Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address, the TLB will conduct an EOI exercise to ascertain the market's interest and plans on developing green maritime fuel storage facilities on the site, with the feedback collected to be taken into consideration in the Government's planning for the site to cater for the industry's needs and facilitate the development of green maritime fuel storage, bunkering and trading activities in Hong Kong.

A spokesperson for the TLB said, ""Green maritime fuel storage facilities are key infrastructure for the development of a green maritime fuel supply chain in Hong Kong, and the size and location of the site are ideal for such development. Interested parties are strongly encouraged to submit EOIs and indicate ideas on the site development including development mode, design of the storage facility and operation plan, etc. The EOI exercise is not a tender exercise nor part of a procurement exercise.""

The site is a piece of largely formed flat land of around nine hectares in size with seafront access. It is currently zoned as ""Other Specified Uses"" annotated ""Container Related Uses"". Subject to the views gathered through this EOI exercise, the Government will go through the necessary procedures for applying for the relevant planning permission for using the site as a Dangerous Goods Godown, so that it can be developed for the storage of low- or zero-emission green maritime fuels, including but not limited to liquefied natural gas, green methanol, green ammonia, hydrogen and biodiesel. In case of need, the use of a minor portion of the site for storage of green fuels for non-maritime usage during the initial period could be considered.

The future developer and operator of the site shall prepare, construct and operate the green maritime fuel storage facilities at its own cost on a commercial basis. A pier shall also be constructed for the loading and unloading of green maritime fuel to be stored on the site.

The deadline for submission of EOIs is noon on November 25, 2025 (Tuesday). The TLB, together with the Civil Engineering and Development Department, will hold online briefing sessions on the EOI invitation. Details of the EOI invitation and briefing sessions can be found on the webpage of the TLB (www.tlb.gov.hk/eng/highlights/transport/greenfuelstorage_eoi.html)."

問題：

據報早前有本港市民透過內地電商平台購買包括煙霧彈等禁運物品，並以跨境運輸方式送抵香港，有意見指出有關行為或已觸犯本港法例，進口煙霧彈等危險品亦對公共安全構成潛在風險。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年由內地經陸路口岸進口至香港的總貨運量為何；香港海關（海關）平均每日抽檢該等進口貨品的數量及比例，以及涉及的抽查方法及風險評估準則為何；

（二）過去五年，每年海關於陸路口岸偵破以郵遞及快遞方式進口禁運物品的案件數目為何，並按禁運物品類別（例如食物、武器、爆炸品、危險藥物及動植物等）列出分項數字；

（三）過去三年，政府曾與內地相關部門展開哪些聯合執法行動，以打擊跨境網購禁運物品；相關政府部門未來的執法方向為何，以及有何措施加強執法；

（四）會否考慮與內地相關部門建立合作機制以加強管制進口物品，包括要求跨境電商平台商戶如實及詳細申報商品資料作清關用途，以及在結帳頁面或商品展示頁面設置「香港禁運物品提示彈窗」，並提供清晰的禁運物品清單；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（五）會否考慮進一步優化智慧海關系統、提升對可疑包裹的抽查比例、增加於口岸執勤的海關搜查犬數量，以及採取其他合適措施，以加強海關在口岸截查違禁品的能力；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（六）會否考慮透過立法、修例或其他方式，釐清涉及跨境網購禁運物品各方的法律責任，以堵塞現行執法上的漏洞；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

隨着消費者對境外商品的需求增加，以及支付和物流等配套服務越趨完善和高效，跨境網購日漸普及。香港對所有禁運／受管制物品的進出口均有嚴格規管，並設有不同法例對危險藥物、武器、受管制化學品、食物和動植物等各類物品進行管制。相關規管適用於所有進出口模式，包括透過跨境電子商貿（電商）平台購入的物品。例如，根據《進出口條例》（第60章），所有受管制物品必須先獲得有關當局簽發的有效牌照或許可證，方能進出口。若沒有有效牌照或許可證而把任何受管制物品帶進／帶出香港（無論自攜、郵寄或經代購集運），除了涉案的物品會被充公，違例者也可遭檢控。

就問題的六個部分，經諮詢保安局和香港海關後，現回覆如下：

（一）於二○二○至二○二四年，由內地經陸路口岸進口至香港的總貨運量數字如下：






年份

二○二一
13 567


二○二二

二○二三
11 022


二○二四
13 174




香港海關一直應用風險評估和情報分析，並透過與內地執法機關保持緊密情報交流，打擊跨境走私活動。除了透過審閱相關文件（例如艙單、預報貨物資料等），對所有經陸路口岸進出香港的貨物作風險管控，揀選可疑貨物查驗（包括透過X光檢查器及離子分析儀掃描、打開包裝檢查和海關搜查犬嗅查等）外，香港海關同時會靈活調配內部資源，適時開展具針對性的反走私行動，以防止禁運／受管制物品非法進出本港。香港海關沒有備存平均每日抽檢進口貨品的數字。

（二）於二○二○至二○二四年，香港海關於陸路口岸偵破以貨運方式走私的案件數目如下：




年份
案件總數


二○二○

按檢獲物品類別列出分項數字的詳情載列於附件。

（三）、（四）及（六）香港海關採取風險管理、情報交流和分析的執法策略，致力堵截各類違禁品流入香港。海關人員在各出入境管制站對旅客、貨物和運輸工具進行監控和查驗，並不時與內地海關進行聯合行動，打擊各類物品的跨境走私活動。

兩地海關已在各陸路口岸建立執法信息共享和協調機制，包括與深圳海關簽署了《香港海關與深圳海關深港陸路口岸「點對點」快捷協作聯繫備忘錄》，深化兩地之間的交流合作。香港海關會繼續與內地相關部門及其他政府部門緊密合作，加強情報交流及適時採取聯合行動，提升執法成效，並會引進和採用先進偵察設備（例如X光檢查器、離子分析儀及拉曼光譜分析儀等），以提升偵測各類違禁品的能力和提高清關效率。

此外，香港海關與非本地跨境電商平台已建立專責人員溝通機制，進行交流和加強合規推廣，包括向平台闡釋香港相關法例就各類物品的規管要求和進口管制情況，並要求進口受管制物品必須嚴格遵從香港法例的規定。

（五）香港海關一直致力推進智慧海關以提升清關效率，透過運用人工智能技術及大數據分析，並利用先進查驗設備（例如具備人工智能的電腦斷層掃描檢查系統、X光檢查器自動偵測儀、智能車底機械人、X光影像分析支援系統、車輛查驗策略分析系統等），以協助進行風險分析，同時會在邊境管制站靈活調配人手和搜查犬，根據風險評估對旅客、貨物和車輛進行查驗和清關工作。"
LCQ20: Regulating cross-boundary online shopping,2025-09-25 14:22,2025-09-25 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500595.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Dr Bernard Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 Earlier on, some Hong Kong residents were reported to have purchased prohibited articles, including smoke bombs, through Mainland's e-‍commerce platforms and delivered them to Hong Kong via cross-boundary transportation. There are views pointing out that such actions might have violated Hong Kong legislation, and that the importation of dangerous goods such as smoke bombs also poses potential risks to public safety. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the total volume of freight imported from the Mainland to Hong Kong through land boundary control points (BCPs) over the past five years; the average number and proportion of such imported items inspected by the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) per day, as well as the inspection methods and risk assessment criteria involved;

(2) of the number of cases detected by the C&ED at land BCPs involving the importation of prohibited articles through postal parcel and express courier channels in each of the past five years, with a breakdown by type of prohibited articles (e.g. foodstuffs, weapons, explosives, dangerous drugs, plants and animals, etc);

(3) of the joint enforcement operations undertaken by the Government and the relevant Mainland authorities to combat cross-boundary online purchase of prohibited articles over the past three years; the future enforcement direction of the relevant government departments, as well as the measures in place to step up enforcement;

(4) whether it will consider establishing a co-operation mechanism with the relevant Mainland authorities to strengthen controls over imported items, including requiring cross-boundary e-commerce platform merchants to declare accurate and detailed product information for the purpose of customs clearance, as well as setting up a ""pop-up window for Hong Kong's prohibited articles"" on checkout pages or product display pages, and providing a clear list of prohibited articles; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(5) whether it will consider further enhancing the Smart Customs system, increasing the proportion of random checks on suspicious parcels, raising the number of Customs Detector Dogs performing duties at the BCPs, as well as adopting other appropriate measures to enhance the C&ED's capability to intercept prohibited articles at the BCPs; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(6) whether it will consider clarifying the legal responsibilities of all parties involved in cross-boundary online purchase of prohibited articles by way of enactment of legislation, legislative amendments or alternative means, in order to plug the existing loopholes in law enforcement; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 As the consumer demand for non-local commodities is rising and supporting services such as payment and logistics are becoming more comprehensive and efficient, cross-border online shopping becomes increasingly popular. There are strict regulations in Hong Kong on the import and export of all prohibited/controlled items, with different legislation in place to control and regulate such items like dangerous drugs, weapons, controlled chemicals, food, animals and plants, etc. These regulations are applicable to all modes of import and export, including items purchased through cross-border electronic commerce (e-commerce) platforms. For instance, under the Import and Export Ordinance (Cap. 60), import or export of all controlled items must be accompanied by a valid licence or permit issued by the relevant authorities. Any person who brings any controlled item into/out of Hong Kong (whether by person, by post, or through purchasing agents or consolidated consignments) without a valid licence or permit may be prosecuted, in addition to confiscation of the subject item.

 Having consulted the Security Bureau and the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), the reply to the six parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The total cargo volume imported from the Mainland to Hong Kong via land boundary control points from 2020 to 2024 is as follows:




Year
Total cargo volume (thousand tonnes)


2020
12 425


2021
13 567


2022
6 905


2023
11 022


2024
13 174




 The C&ED has all along been applying risk assessment and intelligence analysis, and maintaining close intelligence exchange with the Mainland law enforcement agencies to combat cross-boundary smuggling activities. Apart from reviewing relevant documents (such as manifests, advance cargo information, etc) and conducting risk management on all cargoes importing into and exporting from Hong Kong through land boundary control points for selecting suspicious cargoes for inspection (via scanning by X-ray checker and ion scanner, open examination and sniffing by Customs detector dogs, etc), the C&ED flexibly deploys its internal resources to mount targeted anti-smuggling operations in a timely manner to prevent prohibited articles or controlled items from importing into and exporting out of Hong Kong illegally. The C&ED does not maintain daily average figures of the import cargoes inspected.

(2) The number of smuggling cases (via cargo mode) detected by the C&ED at land boundary control points from 2020 to 2024 is as follows:




Year
Total number of cases


2020
425


2021
580


2022
336


2023
337


2024
391




 The detailed figures by the types of major items seized are at Annex.

(3), (4) and (6) The C&ED makes use of enforcement strategies of risk management, intelligence exchange and analysis to combat the illegal imports of various types of prohibited articles. Customs officers conduct checking and clearance on passengers, cargoes and conveyances at various control points, and mount joint enforcement actions with the Mainland Customs from time to time to combat cross-boundary smuggling activities of various articles.

 The Customs authorities of the Mainland and Hong Kong have established an information sharing and co-ordination mechanism at land boundary control points, including the signing of the memorandum regarding the point-to-point express co-operation and liaison between Shenzhen and Hong Kong Land Boundary Control Points with the Shenzhen customs authority to deepen mutual exchange and co-operation. The C&ED will continue to work closely with relevant Mainland authorities and other government departments to strengthen intelligence exchange and conduct joint enforcement actions in a timely manner with a view to enhancing enforcement effectiveness. Besides, the C&ED introduces and applies various types of advanced inspection equipment (including X-ray checker, ion scanner and Raman spectrometer) to enhance detection capability for various types of prohibited articles and clearance efficiency.

 In addition, the C&ED has established a communication mechanism with non-local cross-border e-commerce platforms for dedicated staff to conduct exchanges and step up compliance promotion, including explaining to the platforms the regulatory and import control requirements of various items under the relevant Hong Kong legislation, as well as requiring strict compliance with the laws of Hong Kong for all the imports of controlled items.

(5) The C&ED has been taking forward the Smart Customs development to enhance clearance efficiency through making use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics, and has deployed advanced inspection equipment (such as computed tomography scanners with AI functions, auto-detection devices for X-ray checkers, Smart Under Vehicle Robots, Platform for X-ray Image Evaluation, Vehicle Inspection and Strategic Analysis System, etc) to assist in risk analysis. At the same time, the C&ED will flexibly deploy manpower and detector dogs at boundary control points to conduct inspections and clearance of passengers, cargoes, and vehicles based on risk assessment."

立法會十五題：公營醫療收費改革,2025-09-25 14:10,2025-09-25 14:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500510.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上狄志遠議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

政府於今年三月二十五日公布公營醫療收費改革詳情，並將於明年一月一日實施新的收費架構。該收費改革以「能者共付、輕症共付」為原則，而現有的醫療費用減免機制（減免機制）將會優化，以使資源能精準投放在有急切醫療需要的病人。然而，有意見指出政府至今未有公布優化減免機制的具體行政程序，以及現有機制與優化後機制的過渡安排，擔心出現先加價而後減免的「真空期」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）優化減免機制的具體行政程序（包括但不限於合資格人士的逐項收費服務的豁免額安排，以及現有機制與優化後機制的過渡安排等）為何；

（二）是否知悉，醫院管理局（醫管局）優化減免機制後所需的額外人手為何；

（三）鑑於當局預計優化減免機制的合資格受惠人數將大幅增加至140萬，政府是否知悉，醫管局有何具體措施有效簡化申請審批程序，以及會否訂立審批承諾期（例如承諾在病人提交申請後一星期內完成審批，並向獲批個案發放資助），以使病人能及時得到援助；及

（四）鑑於根據醫務衞生局於今年四月向本會衞生事務委員會提交的文件，醫務衞生局預計五年落實公營醫療收費改革，有關工作的具體時間表為何？

答覆：

主席：

就狄志遠議員的提問，經諮詢醫院管理局（醫管局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

香港的醫療體系以其高效和優質的服務聞名，公營醫療系統不僅是醫療體系的基石，更是全民的安全網，必須確保穩健和可持續。現時公營醫療服務由公帑大幅資助，資助率高達97.6%。然而，隨着人口老化、服務需求增加及醫療成本持續上升，香港的醫療體系面臨前所未有的挑戰。

政府正全方位推行醫療體制改革，公營醫療收費改革是其中必不可少的一環，改革基於以下五大原則：

（i）承擔不減：政府對市民的健康承擔不變，改革所得全數投放公營醫療；
（ii）能者共付，輕症共付：政府會合理地擴展和提升共付機制；
（iii）有加有減：加強「貧、急、重、危」病人保障，減少浪費；
（iv）高度資助：改革之後仍然會維持高度資助，目標是完成改革進程後仍維持約九成整體公營資助率；及
（v）循序漸進：按步就班五年內達至目標。

改革公營醫療服務資助架構旨在引導市民善用醫療資源、減少浪費濫用，全方位加強對「貧、急、重、危」病人的醫療保障，從而提升醫療系統的可持續性，並強化公營醫療系統來應對人口老化、醫療通脹等挑戰，發揮全民安全網的作用。

相關措施包括優化醫療費用減免機制，放寬有關的入息及資產申請資格上限，以保障更多低收入基層市民。除現時三類社福計劃下的全額減免受惠人（包括綜合社會保障援助計劃受助人、75歲或以上長者生活津貼受惠人，及長者院舍照顧服務券計劃級別0院舍券持有人）外，預計合資格受惠人數會由30萬增至140萬，即有額外110萬低收入基層市民由以往無減免變為符合費用部分或全部豁免，加上現有60萬上述三類社福計劃下的全免受惠人，全港將約有200萬包括弱勢社群及收入較低的市民得到全免或部分醫療費用減免保障，涵蓋病人使用住院、門診以及急症等服務時自費藥械以外的所有收費。

自公營醫療收費改革方案於三月底公布以來，醫務衞生局（醫衞局）和醫管局一直積極向立法會、醫療專業和病人組織、公眾和其他界別持份者解說，並製作不同的資訊包、短片及宣傳刊物等，協助市民了解醫療保障新措施。醫衞局亦聯同醫管局舉辦區議會簡介會，向共400多名區議員及地區人士講解改革內容，並借助區議會作為橋樑的角色，協助市民加深了解收費改革的實質內容和意義，讓市民明白改革能為他們提供更全面的醫療保障。同時，醫管局亦正全力落實公營醫療收費改革下的各項措施，確保改革能於明年一月一日順利推行。

為配合優化醫療費用減免機制的實行，醫管局會簡化醫療費用減免申請程序，加快審批進度，進一步便利市民。在優化後的醫療減免機制下，費用減免的最長有效期將由12個月延長至18個月，減少病人需重覆申請的次數。同時，費用減免的涵蓋範圍亦會擴闊至涵蓋偶發性普通科門診服務，病人於減免有效期內使用有關服務無須再額外申請一次性醫療費用減免。醫管局亦會放寬申請時經濟審查下「家庭」的定義，部分同住但沒有直接財政聯繫者日後將無須納入經濟審查，減省審查過程要評估的文件，從而加快申請程序。

此外，醫管局會減少重覆核實病人收入和資產資料的需要。病人如需於最多18個月內再次申請減免，只需簽署聲明書確認家庭財政狀況不變，無須重新提交經濟文件作審查。如申請人家屬為仍有效的醫療費用減免受惠人，醫管局會參考其於申請時所提交的財務資料，並按實際情況只要求申請人提供必要或有所欠缺的資料，而無須逐一重頭評估。除此之外，醫管局亦會參考市民在社福和其他政府資助計劃下已確認的經濟審查資格，盡量減省於處理醫療收費減免申請時需重覆審查的資料。

另一方面，申請及評估過程亦會盡量以電子化方式處理，醫管局正逐步提升電子系統讓市民能夠利用「HA Go」流動應用程式遞交文件及申請，以方便市民及提升處理申請的效率。

為了應對優化醫療減免機制下的額外申請，醫管局亦正陸續增聘人手，並成立十隊專隊，每隊專隊約十多人，分布不同醫院，負責分流及處理有關申請。醫管局會持續地檢視相關的人手需求，並按情況作出調配，確保市民的醫療費用減免申請能適時處理，從而令市民不會因經濟原因而得不到適當的醫療服務，同時善用有關資源。

此外，考慮到醫療費用減免申請數量在明年新收費生效時將無可避免地增加，除設立專隊分流及處理申請外，醫管局將提早於今年年底接受已預約明年一至二月使用相關服務的病人提交醫療費用減免申請。在調整收費的首階段，醫管局亦會採取一系列暫時性安排以應付新增的申請，例如為未能及時完成經濟審查而有急切醫療需要的病人發出有條件減免書、協助已使用服務並成功申請減免的病人處理退款等。有關詳細安排將於十月內向市民公布。

是次新收費已於今年四月二十五日刊憲，並將於二○二六年一月一日生效。政府及醫管局會於二○二六年一月起實施第一輪收費改革安排後，基於循序漸進的原則，按既有機制每兩年進行一次檢討，預計五年落實相關改革。在落實醫療收費改革的同時，政府將繼續推行其他範疇的醫療改革，建構「健康香港」。"
LCQ15: Fees and charges reform for public healthcare,2025-09-25 14:10,2025-09-25 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500513.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Tik Chi-yuen and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  The Government announced details of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare on March 25 this year, with the new structure of fees and charges to be implemented on January 1 next year. The fees and charges reform is based on the principles of ""co-payment by those who can afford and co-payment by those with mild conditions"", and the existing medical fee waiving mechanism (waiving mechanism) will be enhanced to enable resources to be precisely allocated to patients with urgent medical needs. However, there are views pointing out that the Government has yet to announce the specific administrative procedures for enhancing the waiving mechanism, as well as the transitional arrangements between the existing mechanism and the enhanced mechanism, arousing concerns about a ""vacuum period"" where fees are increased before waivers are implemented. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the specific administrative procedures for enhancing the waiving mechanism (including but not limited to the allowance arrangements for itemised services for eligible persons, and the transitional arrangements between the existing mechanism and the enhanced mechanism, etc.);

(2) whether it knows the additional manpower required by the Hospital Authority (HA) after enhancing the waiving mechanism;

(3) given that the authorities anticipate a significant increase in the number of eligible beneficiaries under the enhanced waiving mechanism to 1.4 million, whether the Government knows the specific measures put in place by the HA to effectively streamline the vetting and approval procedures for applications, and whether it will set a commitment period for vetting and approval (e.g. undertaking to complete vetting and approval within one week after a patient's application is submitted and disburse subsidies to approved cases), so that patients can receive timely assistance; and

(4) given that according to the paper submitted by the Health Bureau to the Panel on Health Services of this Council in April this year, the Health Bureau expects that the fees and charges reform for public healthcare will take five years, of the specific timetable for the relevant work?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Tik Chi-yuen is as follows:

  Hong Kong's healthcare system is renowned for its efficient and quality services. The public healthcare system is not only the cornerstone of the healthcare system, but also a safety net for all, and must be robust and sustainable. At present, public healthcare services are heavily subsidised by public funds, with a subsidy rate as high as 97.6 per cent. However, with an ageing population, increasing demand for services and rising healthcare costs, Hong Kong's healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges.

  The Government is implementing healthcare system reform in a holistic manner, of which the fees and charges reform for public healthcare is an integral part. The reform is based on the following five principles:

(i) Commitment will not be lessened: The Government's commitment to public health will remain unchanged. All gains from the reform will be wholly utilised for public healthcare services;
(ii) Co-payment for those who can afford it and for those with mild conditions: The Government will reasonably expand and enhance the co-payment mechanism;
(iii) Enhancement and reduction: Protection for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients will be enhanced and wastage will be reduced;
(iv) High subsidisation: The high level of subsidy will be maintained after the reform, with the target of maintaining the 90 per cent overall public subsidisation rate; and
(v) Gradual and orderly progress: The objective will be achieved in a progressive and orderly manner in five years.

  Reforming the subsidisation structure of public healthcare services aims to guide the public to make optimal use of healthcare resources, reduce wastage and abuse, and enhance healthcare protection for ""poor, acute, serious, critical"" patients on all fronts, thereby enhancing the sustainability of the healthcare system and strengthening the public healthcare system to cope with the challenges posed by an ageing population, inflation of healthcare costs, etc., and serve as a safety net for all.

  Relevant measures include enhancing the medical fee waiver mechanism by relaxing the income and asset limits under the eligibility criteria for application to protect more low-income grassroot citizens. Apart from the current full waiver beneficiaries under the three categories of social welfare schemes (including Comprehensive Social Security Assistance recipients, Old Age Living Allowance recipients aged 75 or above and Level 0 Voucher Holders of the Residential Care Service Voucher Scheme for the Elderly), the number of eligible beneficiaries is estimated to increase from 300 000 to 1.4 million. This means an additional 1.1 million low-income grassroot citizens who currently do not hold fee waivers will be eligible for partial or full fee waivers. Together with the existing 600 000 full waiver beneficiaries under the three aforementioned social welfare schemes, about two million citizens in Hong Kong, including those from the underprivileged and low income groups, will be eligible for full or partial medical fee waiver, covering all fees and charges incurred by patients for using in-patient, out-patient, as well as accident and emergency services etc., except for self-financed drugs and medical devices.

  Since the announcement of the fees and charges reform for public healthcare at the end of March, the Health Bureau (HHB) and the HA have been proactively explaining the reform to the Legislative Council, healthcare professionals and patient organisations, members of the public and other stakeholders, and have produced various information packs, short videos and promotional materials to help the public understand the new healthcare protection measures. The HHB and the HA have jointly organised briefings for the District Councils (DCs) to explain the reform to over 400 DC members and local community members, and leverage the role of DC as a bridge to assist members of the public to get a better grasp of the substance and significance of the fees and charges reform, with a view to helping the public understand that the reform can provide them with more comprehensive healthcare protection. Meanwhile, the HA is also pressing ahead at full steam with the implementation of the various measures under the fees and charges reform for public healthcare to ensure its smooth implementation on January 1 next year.

  To dovetail with the implementation of the enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism, the HA will streamline the application process for medical fee waivers and expedite the progress of assessment to further facilitate the public. Under the enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism, the maximum validity period of fee waivers will be extended from 12 to 18 months, reducing the number of times patients need to re-apply. The scope of coverage for fee waivers will also be expanded to include episodic appointments for general out-patient clinic services. Patients using such services within the waiver validity period will no longer need to apply separately for one-off medical fee waivers. The HA will also relax the definition of ""household"" for the purpose of financial assessment during application. Family members who live with but not financially connected with the patient direct will no longer be included in the financial assessment, reducing the documents required for vetting thereby expediting the application process.

  Moreover, the HA will reduce the need for repeated verification of patients' income and asset information. For re-applications within a maximum period of 18 months, patients will only be required to sign a declaration confirming that there is no change to their household financial situation, without having to re-submit financial documents for assessment. Where the applicant's family member is a current medical fee waiver beneficiary, the HA will refer to the financial information submitted at the time of the family member's application and, based on actual circumstances, and only require the applicant to provide the necessary or missing information instead of starting a full re-assessment afresh for every case. Moreover, the HA will also refer to the verified financial assessment eligibility results of citizens under other social welfare and government subsidy schemes so as to minimise the need for repeated assessment when processing medical fee waiver applications.

  Furthermore, the application and assessment process will be conducted electronically as far as possible. The HA is progressively upgrading its electronic systems to facilitate citizens in submitting documents and applications via ""HA Go"" mobile application, thereby making it more convenient for the public and enhancing the efficiency of processing applications.

  To handle the additional applications under the enhanced medical fee waiver mechanism, the HA is also progressively recruiting additional staff to set up ten dedicated teams, with each team comprising approximately ten members, to be deployed across various hospitals to triage and process the relevant applications. The HA will continuously review the relevant manpower needs and make deployments as necessary to ensure timely processing of citizens' medical fee waiver applications so that citizens will not be denied adequate medical care due to lack of means, while also optimising the use of the relevant resources.

  Moreover, having regard to the inevitable increase in the volume of applications for medical fee waivers when the new fees and charges take effect next year, apart from setting up dedicated teams to triage and process applications, the HA will also begin to accept advance applications for medical fee waivers at the end of this year for patients with scheduled appointments for January to February next year. During the initial phase of fees and charges adjustments, the HA will also implement a series of temporary arrangements to manage the increased volume of applications. These include issuing conditional waivers for patients with urgent medical needs and whose financial assessment has not been completed, arranging refunds for patients who have already used the services and have subsequently been granted waivers. The relevant detailed arrangements will be announced to the public within October.

  The new fees and charges were gazetted on April 25 this year and will take effect on January 1, 2026. After the implementation of the first phase of the fees and charges reform in January 2026, the Government and the HA will follow the principle of progressive and orderly implementation and conduct a review every two years in accordance with the existing mechanism. The relevant reform is expected to be fully implemented in five years. Alongside the implementation of the fees and charges reform for healthcare, the Government will continue to take forward healthcare reform in other areas to build a ""Healthy Hong Kong""."
LCQ11: Enhancing regulation of cross-boundary remittance services,2025-09-25 14:00,2025-09-25 14:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092400905.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Leung and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

  It has been reported that quite a number of disputes and complaints involving cross-boundary remittance services have arisen in recent years, and the public has much concern about the security of cross-boundary remittances to the Mainland. Regarding enhancing regulation of cross-boundary remittance services, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) from 2019 to July 2025, of the respective numbers of (i) premises for operating cash note exchange and (ii) premises for operating cryptocurrency trading in Hong Kong that obtained a Money Service Operator (MSO) licence and operated remittance services (set out in Table 1);

(3) Regarding cases where problems arise during cross-boundary remittance process, whether the authorities will consider classifying the relevant remittance institutions (such as money changers) as failing to meet the ""fit and proper person"" criteria for a MSO licence, based on non-compliances confirmed by the government authorities of the remittance destination (e.g. using non-compliant third-party transfers during the remittance process, the remittance being classified as all or part of the funds for money laundering or terrorist financing, etc.); if not, of the reasons for that; and

(4) as it is learnt that some money changers require customers to sign ""transaction notes"" containing additional disclaimers and terms before providing cross-boundary remittance services, thereby exempting themselves from liability should problems arise from such remittances, whether the authorities will consider further regulating money changers holding an MSO licence to prevent them from evading the liability through certain exemption clauses; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615) establishes a licensing regime for money service operators. The Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) is the law enforcement agency responsible for administering this licensing system and regulating currency exchange and remittance services.

  Having consulted the C&ED, the reply to the four parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The number of particular premises operated by licensed money service operators during the period from 2019 to July 2025 is as follows:




Year (as at year-end)

  Regarding the regulation of cryptocurrency trading services, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) conducted a public consultation from June to August 2025 on the legislative proposals for regulating digital asset trading service providers. The FSTB and the SFC are formulating details of the licensing regimes based on the feedback received, with a target of submitting a bill to the Legislative Council in 2026.

(2) As regards the complaints and assistance requests received by the C&ED concerning remittances from Hong Kong to the Mainland, they mainly involve cases where funds remitted through money service operators to Mainland bank accounts were frozen. Between 2019 and 2022, the C&ED did not receive such reports or requests for assistance. From 2023 to the first two quarters of 2025, the C&ED received a total of 1 046 assistance requests involving frozen remittances to Mainland bank accounts through money service operators, involving 98 money service operators and an amount of approximately Renminbi (RMB) 63 million in total.

  Regarding the aforementioned cases involving frozen remittances to Mainland bank accounts through money service operators, the annual breakdown is tabulated below:






2023
2024
2025
			(as at end-June)


Number of assistance requests
161

Amount involved
			(RMB million)
approx. 10.69
approx.44.10
approx.8.59




Note: Some money service operators were involved in more than one assistance request.

  The C&ED has contacted all affected individuals and has actively followed up with the relevant licensed money service operators to facilitate communication and negotiations between the parties involved. With the C&ED's intervention, the situation of frozen remittances in 359 cases has been resolved so far, involving a total amount of approximately RMB 19 million. In addition, the C&ED will enhance collaboration with relevant Mainland authorities to assist the affected individuals.

(3) When applying for or renewing a licence, money service operators must comply with the ""fit and proper"" requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615) and the relevant guidelines. They are also required to submit a business plan to the C&ED, detailing the operational model and rationale, clearly disclosing the fund flow and delivery channels, and demonstrating that effective and appropriate anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures (including a mechanism for monitoring daily operation) are in place. Through these licensing requirements, the C&ED can effectively assess and monitor the risks associated with money service operators of varying business models and scales.

  When the C&ED assesses the ""fitness and properness"" of a money service operator, whether the money service operator is involved in non-compliance is one of the important factors of consideration. If non-compliance is identified (e.g. transactions conducted via delivery channels unapproved by C&ED or involving illicit funds), the C&ED will, based on facts and evidence, take decisive enforcement actions, including administrative sanctions (e.g. licence revocation or refusal of licence renewal) and/or criminal prosecution.

(4) The C&ED attaches great importance to the compliance of money service operators in providing currency exchange and remittance services, and has implemented ongoing supervisory measures. These include, among others, requiring licence applicants and licensees to clearly outline in their business plans and transaction records respectively the fund delivery channels and the safeguards (e.g. compensation mechanisms) that will be provided to customers in the event of problems arising from cross-boundary remittances. This ensures that customer funds are handled and transactions are completed in a proper manner, safeguarding the interest of the public and customers. Before granting a money service operator licence, the C&ED conducts a comprehensive assessment of the applicant's competence, integrity, and ability to operate fairly, so as to ensure that their business models do not harm or potentially harm the interest of the public and customers.

  The C&ED will continue to closely monitor market developments and review the regulatory requirements for the money service industry as appropriate."

主席：

《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（第615章）訂立了金錢服務經營者的發牌制度。香港海關（海關）是執行該發牌制度的執法機構，負責規管貨幣兌換及匯款服務。

就問題的四個部分，經諮詢海關後，現回覆如下：

（一）在二○一九年至二○二五年七月期間，由持牌金錢服務經營者所經營的特定處所的數目如下：

在加密貨幣交易服務的規管方面，財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）和證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會）剛於二○二五年六月至八月就規管數字資產交易服務提供者的立法建議進行公眾諮詢。財庫局與證監會正參考所得的意見，制訂相關發牌制度的細節，目標於二○二六年向立法會提交條例草案。

（二）海關接獲由香港匯款至內地的投訴或求助個案當中，主要為涉及透過金錢服務經營者匯款至內地銀行帳戶後遭凍結的情況。海關在二○一九年至二○二二年期間，並沒有接獲相關類型的求助或舉報個案。在二○二三年至二○二五年首兩季期間，海關共接獲1 046宗透過金錢服務經營者匯款至內地銀行戶口後遭凍結的求助個案，合共涉及98個金錢服務經營者，總金額約為6,300萬元人民幣。就上述涉及透過金錢服務經營者匯款至內地銀行帳戶後遭凍結的個案，按年的分項數字表列如下：

註：部分金錢服務經營者涉及多於一宗求助個案。

海關已聯絡所有求助人，並積極向相關持牌金錢服務經營者作跟進，促使雙方協商處理有關情況。經海關介入後，目前共有359宗求助個案的匯款凍結情況已獲解決，涉及金額合共約1,900萬元人民幣。此外，海關將進一步加強與內地相關機構的協作，以協助受影響人士。

（三）金錢服務經營者在申請牌照或續牌時，必須符合《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（第615章）及相關指引訂定的適當人選要求，以及向香港海關提交業務計劃，當中需要闡述其營運模式和其合理性、明確披露資金流向和交付渠道，以及充分證明已採取有效合宜的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集措施，包括日常營運監察機制。透過上述的發牌要求，香港海關能有效評估和監察不同營運模式和規模的金錢服務經營者的相關風險。

海關在評估金錢服務經營者是否適當人選時，其是否存在違規情況是其中一個重要考慮因素。若發現違規情況（如未按海關批出牌照時所核准的交付渠道進行交易，或交易涉及違法資金），海關將根據事實和證據果斷採取執法行動，包括對違規者實施行政制裁（如撤銷牌照、拒絕續牌）及／或提出刑事檢控。

（四）海關高度重視金錢服務經營者在提供貨幣兌換及匯款服務過程中的合規性，並持續採取多項監管措施。這些措施包括但不限於要求牌照申請人及持牌人分別在業務計劃書和交易單據中，明確闡述資金交付渠道及跨境匯款出現問題時將為客戶提供的保障措施（例如賠償機制），以確保金錢服務經營者以妥善方式處理客戶資金及完成交易，切實保障客戶與公眾的權益。在批出金錢服務經營者牌照前，海關會全面評估申請人是否具備稱職、誠實及公正經營業務的能力，並確保其運營方式不會損害或可能損害客戶或公眾利益。

海關會繼續密切留意市場發展，適時檢視適用於金錢服務業的監管要求。"

（三）為進一步協助中高齡失業人士投入職場，政府會否盡早就「再就業津貼試行計劃」進行中期檢討，並增加該計劃的資源投放和延長推行年期，同時加強工會在就業輔導方面的角色，以及積極提供在職及轉職培訓和創業支援措施，以提升該計劃成效及覆蓋面？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直密切留意香港就業市場的情況和變化，致力推動培訓及再培訓以提升本地勞動人口的質素及生產力，同時提供各類就業服務，鼓勵及協助市民投入就業市場。政府明白就業情況會繼續受個別行業的經營狀況影響，而香港經濟穩定增長，以及政府多項推動經濟增長、增強經濟動能和提振消費氣氛的措施，應會為整體勞工需求提供支持。

就議員的提問，經諮詢發展局後，現答覆如下：

（一）勞工處為求職人士提供多元化及免費的就業服務，並積極聯繫僱主，搜羅各行業的職位空缺，促進就業資訊流通。過去24個月，勞工處從私營機構接獲的按月職位空缺數目，以及職位空缺按行業、職位性質及薪金劃分的分項數字載於附件。按行業分布，職位空缺最多的為金融、保險、地產及商用服務業，其次為飲食及酒店業，以及批發、零售及進出口貿易業。期間，每月薪金達15,000元或以上的職位空缺，佔空缺的總數從61%逐步上升至66%。

現時絕大部分（99%）在勞工處刊登的職位空缺可供求職人士直接向僱主提出申請而無需登記勞工處的就業配對服務。為提升求職人士覓得合適工作的機會，勞工處就業中心提供個人化就業諮詢及配對服務，就業主任亦提供就業市場的最新資訊、協助求職人士報讀再培訓課程，獲取相關技能及提升獲聘機會。

（二）僱員再培訓局（再培訓局）為本地勞動人口提供培訓及再培訓服務。其中，就業掛鈎課程協助待業及失業人士掌握不同行業的職業技能，提升就業機會。再培訓局亦為失業率較高的行業提供專門的再培訓支援，提升競爭力。

除舉辦大型招聘會及地區性專題招聘會外，勞工處亦設有飲食業、零售業及建造業的行業性招聘中心，集中展示相關行業的職位空缺，並設置面試室，以便僱主及求職人士即場面試，縮短招聘及求職的時間。勞工處「互動就業服務」網站亦設有飲食業、零售業及建造業專題網頁，方便求職人士搜尋，並提供最新的招聘會詳情及培訓資訊。求職人士更可使用「互動就業服務」網站或流動應用程式，選擇收取系統按其預設條件自動選配的最新職位空缺，以及招聘會的資訊。

有關建造業，未來五年每年平均政府工務工程開支將由900億元增加至1,200億元。隨着經濟復甦而私營工程量回升，建造業未來數年人力需求仍然殷切。在發展局支持下，建造業議會積極統籌業界加強培訓建造業工友，包括去年推出的「一專多能」兼讀制短期課程，並提供津貼，鼓勵建造業工友提升技術以增加就業機會。此外，建造業議會亦會加強就業配對服務，包括實體招聘會和網上職位及課程配對，協助建造業工友獲得空缺及培訓資訊。

（三）勞工處去年七月十五日推出「再就業津貼試行計劃」（再就業計劃），鼓勵連續三個月或以上沒有從事獲酬工作的40歲或以上人士，重投就業市場。勞工處已委聘服務機構協助推行再就業計劃。每名連續完成12個月工作的合資格參加者在計劃推行期間最高可獲20,000元再就業津貼。再就業計劃的反應十分理想，截至今年八月共錄得超過50000名參加者及超過27000宗就業個案。勞工處歡迎聘請再就業計劃參加者的僱主同時參加「中高齡就業計劃」，讓中高齡人士提升工作技能。上述兩個計劃對促進中高齡人士就業相輔相成，發揮協同效應。

勞工處正收集和整理再就業計劃參加者及就業個案的資料及數據，並計劃於二○二六年第一季就該計劃進行中期檢討，配合「中高齡就業計劃」，評估計劃的成效及擬定未來路向，包括探討進一步鼓勵銀齡就業的措施。

政府會繼續密切監察經濟及就業市場的變化，適時檢討及調整各項措施及就業服務。"
LCQ4: Addressing rising unemployment rates,2025-09-25 12:53,2025-09-25 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500568.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Tang Ka-piu and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 According to the Census and Statistics Department, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 3.7 per cent between June and August this year. The unemployment rates in the construction sector, food and beverage service activities sector and retail sector were recorded at 6.9 per cent, 6.8 per cent and 5.1 per cent respectively, which is a cause of concern. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the monthly number of new job vacancies received by the Labour Department over the past 24 months, and the sectoral distribution and employment arrangements of such vacancies; whether it has studied the wage trends for these positions and whether it has identified any instances of mismatch between employers and jobs seekers;

(2) as the construction sector, food and beverage service activities sector and retail sector have become three of the sectors with the highest unemployment rates, what other specific measures apart from organising job fairs put in place by the Government to alleviate the unemployment in these sectors; and

(3) to further assist elderly and middle-aged unemployed persons in entering the workforce, whether the Government will expeditiously conduct an interim review of the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme, increase resource allocation to the scheme and extend its implementation period, while simultaneously strengthening the role of trade unions in employment counselling and actively providing on-the-job and career transition training alongside start-up support measures, so as to enhance the effectiveness and coverage of the scheme?

Reply:

President,

 The Government has been closely monitoring the situation and changes of Hong Kong's employment market, and committed to promoting training and retraining to enhance the quality and productivity of our local labour force. In tandem, the Government provides employment services to encourage and assist people to join the labour market. The Government recognises that the business situations of certain sectors will continue to weigh on employment, nevertheless the steady growth of Hong Kong's economy, and the Government's various measures to boost economic growth, enhance economic momentum and bolster consumption sentiment will provide support to the overall labour demand.

 In consultation with the Development Bureau, the reply to the Member's question is provided as follows:

(1) The Labour Department (LD) provides diversified and free employment services to job seekers and actively liaises with employers to canvass job vacancies from different industries with a view to expediting the dissemination of employment information. Over the past 24 months, the job vacancies received from private sector by the LD each month, with breakdowns by industry, job nature and salary range are at Annex. By industry distribution, the financing, insurance, real estate and business services sector recorded the largest number of job vacancies, followed by the restaurants and hotels industry, and the wholesale, retail and import/export trades. During the period, the proportion of job vacancies with a monthly salary of $15,000 or above, relative to the total number of vacancies, increased gradually from 61 per cent to 66 per cent.

 Currently, the vast majority (99 per cent) of job vacancies advertised through the LD allow job seekers to apply directly to employers without the need to register with the LD for job matching services. To enhance job seekers' opportunities to find suitable employment, the LD's job centres provide personalised employment advisory and job matching services. Employment officers provide job seekers with the latest information on the employment market, assist them in enroling retraining courses to acquire relevant work skills and improve their employability.

(2) The Employees Retraining Board (ERB) provides training and retraining services for the local workforce. Of these, placement-tied courses assist people in seeking employment and the unemployed in acquiring industry-specific vocational skills to enhance their employability. The ERB also provides tailor-made retraining support to industries with higher unemployment rates to enhance competitiveness.

 Apart from organising large-scale job fairs and district-based thematic job fairs, the LD has also established industry-based recruitment centres for the catering, retail, and construction industries. These centres specifically display job vacancies of the respective industries, and set up interview rooms so that employers and job seekers can conduct on-the-spot interviews, thereby shortening the time required for recruitment and job seeking. The LD has set up dedicated webpages for the catering, retail, and construction industries on its Interactive Employment Service (iES) website to facilitate job seekers in searching for relevant job vacancies, the latest details on job fairs and training information. Job seekers can also make use of the iES website or its mobile application to opt for receiving automatic updates on latest job vacancies matched automatically by the system with their pre-set criteria as well as information on job fairs.

 As regards the construction industry, the annual average government capital works expenditure will rise from $90 billion to $120 billion over the next five years. As the economy recovers and private sector construction works rebound, the demand for manpower in the construction industry will remain strong in the coming years. With the support of the Development Bureau, the Construction Industry Council has been actively coordinating with the industry to strengthen training for construction workers, including the part-time ""multi-skilled"" short course launched last year, and provide subsidies to encourage construction workers enhancing trade skill to improve their employability. Besides, the Construction Industry Council will strengthen employment matching services, including physical job fairs as well as online platform for job and training course matching, so as to facilitate construction workers' access to information on vacancies and training opportunities.

(3) The LD launched the Re-employment Allowance Pilot Scheme (REA Scheme) on July 15 last year to encourage persons aged 40 or above who have not been engaged in paid work for three consecutive months or more to re-join the employment market. The LD has commissioned service organisations to assist in the implementation of the scheme. Each eligible participant who has worked full-time for 12 months continuously may receive a maximum Re-employment Allowance of $20,000 during the implementation period of the REA Scheme. The REA Scheme has been well-received, with over 50000 participants and over 27000 placements recorded as at August this year. The LD welcomes employers who hired the participants of the REA Scheme to join the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged to uplift the work skills of older and middle-aged persons. Both schemes are complementary and achieve synergy in promoting the employment of older and middle-aged persons.

 The LD is collecting and collating information and data on the participants and placements of the REA Scheme, and planning to conduct a mid-term review in the first quarter of 2026, along with the Employment Programme for the Elderly and Middle-aged, to evaluate the effectiveness of the REA Scheme and map out the way forward, including exploring further measures to promote silver employment.

 The Government will continue to closely monitor changes in the economy and employment market, and review and adjust various measures and employment services in a timely manner."

Question:

Electrical products currently supplied in Hong Kong are primarily regulated by the Electrical Products (Safety) Regulation (Cap. 406G) and must be issued a certificate of safety compliance. However, it is learnt that non-compliant electrical products are still sold in the market from time to time, posing potential safety hazards such as fires and electrical leakage accidents. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of reports of accidents involving electrical products (including but not limited to fires, electrical leakage and minor explosions) received by the Government in the past five years, as well as the number of casualties in such accidents;

(2) of the specific measures put in place to step up monitoring or inspection of non-compliant electrical products in the market;

(3) given that according to the web page of the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD), members of the public may report unsafe electrical products through channels such as 1823, fax and email, of the number of relevant reports or complaints received by the EMSD and other relevant organisations in the past five years; and

(4) whether the Government has specific plans to enhance public knowledge of electrical product safety to facilitate members of the public in choosing compliant electrical products; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department (EMSD) is responsible for the enforcement of the Electrical Products (Safety) Regulation (Cap.406G) (the Regulation) of the Electricity Ordinance (Cap. 406), with a view to ensuring the safety of household electrical products. The reply to the question raised by the Hon Benson Luk is as follows:

(2) The Regulation provides statutory control over all household electrical products supplied in Hong Kong to ensure public safety in terms of the use of these electrical products. According to the Regulation, suppliers of electrical products are required to ensure that household electrical products comply with the applicable safety requirements and have been issued with certificates of safety compliance before they are supplied.

The EMSD conducts annual sample checks on household electrical products supplied in Hong Kong. In the past five years, the EMSD conducted sample checks on 26 types for 300 household electrical products supplied in Hong Kong. It also engages third party testing laboratories to conduct testing based on the relevant safety standards. If relevant products are suspected to be in violation of the Regulation, the EMSD will conduct follow-up investigations.

Besides, the EMSD conducts inspections at retail stores supplying household electrical products, local e-commerce platforms, and their suppliers. Prosecutions will be carried out against non-compliant household electrical products identified during the inspections. The EMSD has conducted around 19600 inspections in the past five years, and uncovered about 380 cases of violations of the Regulation with follow-up prosecutions.

(3) The numbers of reports on unsafe household electrical products received by the EMSD through various channels in the past five years are tabulated as follows:

問題：

政府分別於二○一三年及二○一八年推出廣東計劃和福建計劃，讓選擇在粵閩兩省養老的合資格香港長者，不必每年回港亦可領取高齡津貼或長者生活津貼。關於支援在內地安老的香港長者，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於根據政府數字，截至本年六月分別有26 592名及2 542名長者參加廣東計劃和福建計劃，但政府統計處及福州市人口普查的資料顯示，二○二○年有約90 000名香港長者長居廣東省，而單在福建省福州市已有1 667名香港長者長居，有意見認為有關數據反映眾多香港長者在粵閩兩省安老卻無意申請上述兩項計劃，政府有否研究箇中原因；有否研究如何加強政策配套和支援以釋除長者憂慮，從而吸引更多有意在粵閩兩省安老的長者申請該兩項計劃；

（二）鑑於當局於今年五月宣布將「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」（「試點計劃」）擴展至覆蓋粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）全部九個內地城市，並表示會在評估試點計劃的成效後，考慮在其他地點（例如福建省）推行計劃，相關工作的進展為何；及

（三）鑑於當局於今年三月公布延展「支援粵港澳大灣區醫院管理局病人先導計劃」（先導計劃），以便利合資格的醫院管理局（醫管局）病人可於香港大學深圳醫院接受資助診症服務，而政府亦表示會與醫管局每年檢討該計劃的成效和涵蓋服務範圍並適時作出調整，當局會否考慮將先導計劃擴展至大灣區其他內地城市及福建省內合適的三級甲等醫院；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就陳祖恒議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局後，現回覆如下：

（一）現行可攜現金援助措施，包括綜合社會保障援助（綜援）計劃下的綜援長者廣東及福建省養老計劃，和公共福利金計劃下的廣東計劃和福建計劃。

政府近年持續改善公共福利金計劃，例如二○二二年九月起合併普通及高額長者生活津貼，並於二○二三年九月起放寬公共福利金計劃申請前連續居港一年規定下的離港限制。有關優化措施適用於廣東計劃及福建計劃。過去三年，廣東計劃及福建計劃的總受惠人數上升約三成：廣東計劃的受惠人數由二○二一至二二年度的19509人增加二○二四至二五年度的26077人；福建計劃的受惠人數則由二○二一至二二年度的1963人增加至二○二四至二五年度的2 510人。

擬在或已在粵閩兩省養老的香港長者按自身情況決定是否申請廣東計劃或福建計劃，原因各有不同，不一而足，政府沒有備存有關資料。

為協助香港長者了解上述計劃，社會福利署（社署）委聘代理機構持續透過不同途徑宣傳及推廣，例如設置專題網頁、擺放流動街站、派發宣傳單張和舉辦分享會。社署亦提供電子表格，方便長者在網上遞交申請。如長者因健康理由未能回港，代理機構會在內地進行家訪，協助他們完成申請。社署及代理機構將繼續向合資格長者宣傳有關計劃，以及協助他們申請。

（二）政府在二○二四年推行「長者醫療券大灣區試點計劃」（「試點計劃」），為合資格香港長者提供更大的便利和靈活性，讓他們可在粵港澳大灣區（大灣區）服務點善用長者醫療券（醫療券），使用基層醫療服務，以提升健康。政府在二○二四年六月開始分階段擴大醫療券適用範圍至七間位於大灣區內地城市的綜合醫療／牙科服務機構，覆蓋廣州、中山、東莞和深圳。政府在今年五月宣布擴展「試點計劃」，新增12間醫療機構，至大灣區九個內地城市全覆蓋，並已於八月圓滿達成目標。連同香港大學深圳醫院的一院兩點，合資格長者可在大灣區內地城市合共21個服務點使用醫療券，讓超過178萬名合資格的香港長者受惠。

「試點計劃」擴展至大灣區內地九市全覆蓋標誌着政策創新及兩地醫療合作的又一里程碑。「試點計劃」現尚在運作初期，我們會持續評估及監測醫療券在試點醫療機構的運作及使用、適時檢討「試點計劃」的成效之後再研究下一步安排。

（三）在「支援粵港澳大灣區醫院管理局病人先導計劃」（先導計劃）下，合資格的醫院管理局（醫管局）病人可選擇於大灣區內地城市的指定協作醫療機構接受資助診症服務。此計劃旨在為香港市民接受醫管局服務時提供更多選擇，計劃目前適用於香港大學深圳醫院。在先導計劃的基礎上，針對特定的醫管局服務，政府會研究為已預約醫管局覆診的病人開展更多在大灣區內地城市內接受服務的醫療選擇，並於準備就緒時推出有關措施。現階段政府會針對探討大灣區內合適的內地醫療機構，並會按照與內地優勢互補、互利共贏的原則，考慮多方面的因素，例如醫療服務質素、成本效益和跨境法律法規。"

據報內地近年不斷完善鮮活食品（例如蔬菜、水果、畜禽肉及水產品等）銷售的監管政策，例如二○二三年十二月起實施的《食用農產品市場銷售質量安全監督管理辦法》，全面禁止銷售者使用對生鮮食用農產品真實色澤造成明顯改變的照明設施（俗稱「生鮮燈」)；以及去年四月實施的《限制商品過度包裝要求生鮮食用農產品》國家標準，對該等產品包裝的空隙率、層數及成本比例作出嚴格規範。關於鮮活食品銷售的監管，政府可否告知本會：

（一）會否參考上述內地措施，禁止業界使用會影響鮮活食品真實色澤的照明設施；

（二）除了就減少產品包裝制訂指引（例如環境保護署為特定行業擬訂的《減少包裝及包裝管理實用指引》）外，政府會否考慮仿效內地做法，限制本地鮮活食品過度包裝；

（三）會否借鑑內地或外國的良好監管經驗，優化政策以提高鮮活食品零售市場的透明度，並維護公平競爭的營商環境，從而促進行業的健康發展和增強消費者的信心；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四）有否建立機制以定期評估現行監管鮮活食品銷售政策的成效；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）鑑於有意見認為鮮活食品供應鏈複雜，政府有否計劃建立完善的鮮活食品溯源系統（包括非本地供應的鮮活食品），使消費者能從可靠途徑清楚掌握該等食品的來源地及農場名稱等資訊，並防止假冒和劣質產品流入市面，同時讓優質商户能獲得市場認可？

答覆：

主席：

就李浩然議員有關「生鮮燈」和其他相關議題的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局，我現回覆如下。

（一）及（三）在規管售賣鮮活食品的新鮮糧食店方面，食物環境衞生署（食環署）食物安全中心（食安中心）已建立行之有效的監管機制，以保障食物安全和市民健康，詳情請參閱回覆第（四）及（五）部分。

保障消費者權益方面，香港現時有不同的法例保障消費者權益。其中，《商品說明條例》（第362章）禁止商戶對消費者作出不良營商手法，香港海關（海關）是主要執法機關。另一方面，消費者委員會（消委會）致力研究和倡導維護消費者權益的工作，包括處理消費者就貨品及服務作出的投訴。如消費者懷疑有商戶在提供鮮活食品時，涉及不良營商手法，可向海關作出舉報或向消委會投訴。

（二）香港的鮮活食品供應以進口為主，其包裝也主要在境外進行，規管鮮活食品包裝物料和方式較為複雜。相對而言，鼓勵業界減少或以較環保的方式包裝食品是較為務實的做法。為此，環境保護署（環保署）在今年三月三十一日推出《減少使用包裝約章》，鼓勵企業採取可持續的包裝減量措施，包括重新檢視包裝設計以減少不必要的材料使用、提高包裝的可回收性和重用性，並探索創新的解決方案。現時已有128間企業簽署了約章，其中約有20間企業與鮮活食品零售和食品製造業相關，承諾減少包裝使用。

此外，為協助業界提升包裝管理，環保署制訂了《減少包裝及包裝管理實用指引》供業界參考，涵蓋包括「超級市場及雜貨店」和「食品製造業」等與鮮活食品相關的行業。環保署亦透過宣傳教育（例如工作坊、研討會、網站），推廣簡約包裝和源頭減廢，鼓勵綠色營商和消費。環保署會繼續密切留意各行業減少包裝措施的成效。

（四）及（五）食安中心已建立行之有效的食物安全監管機制，涵蓋進口、批發和零售各個環節，確保在香港銷售的食物（包括鮮活食品）可供安全食用。

一些高風險食物，例如野味、肉類、家禽、蛋類必須來自食環署認可的來源地。相關食品進口時，食安中心亦會檢查進口文件，以及在各進口管制站進行監測工作。此外，《食物安全條例》（第612章）（《條例》）下設立食物追蹤機制，規定任何從事食物業人士須備存食物進出紀錄，包括獲取有關食物的日期、賣方的名稱及聯絡詳情、進口有關食物的地方，以及有關食物的總數量和描述。相關規定可確保在發生食物事故時，當局能快速有效追蹤食物來源和採取相應跟進行動。

食安中心持續透過食物監測計劃，按照風險為本的原則從進口、批發和零售／餐飲層面抽取食物樣本（包括鮮活食品）化驗，針對不合格的監測結果採取相應執法行動。二○二四年，食安中心對約66 900個樣本作恆常監測，整體合格率為99.8%。

食安中心亦一直密切監察本港及其他地方發生的食物事故，根據風險程度、法例要求，以及問題食品有否在本港出售等因素，決定適切的風險管理行動。如有需要，食安中心會就食物事故與有關地區的食物安全當局、進口商、分銷商和零售商聯絡，採取相應行動，例如要求業界停售有關食品、適時進行食品檢測、向業界發出指示，及指令回收問題食品等。食安中心亦會向業界發出快速警報，通知他們最新的情況。如食物事故對本港市民的健康構成影響，食安中心亦會發出新聞公報，向消費者提供建議。

在規管售賣鮮活食品的新鮮糧食店方面，根據《食物業規例》（第132X章）規定，任何人士如有意在本港的樓宇內售賣新鮮、冰鮮或冷藏牛肉、羊肉、豬肉、爬蟲（包括活蛇）、魚（包括活魚）及家禽，必須在開業前向食環署申領新鮮糧食店牌照，並按牌照條件的要求，委任一名曾接受培訓及合資格的全職衞生督導員，在處所監督食物安全及衞生。食環署會按風險定期巡查持牌新鮮糧食店，確保持牌人遵守發牌及持牌條件，並符合法例訂明的衞生標準，倘發現持牌人違反持牌條件，會發出口頭或書面警告，並就嚴重個案考慮取消其牌照。除執行規管措施外，食環署一直向持牌人提供衞生教育，包括在定期巡查處所時，向持牌人及其員工提供有關食物安全及衞生方面的教育，並透過食物衞生講座、研討會及工作坊等，提高業界的食物安全及食物衞生水平。"
LCQ7: Regulation of the sale of fresh produce,2025-09-25 12:45,2025-09-25 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500632.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 It has been reported that, in recent years, the Mainland has continuously improved its regulatory policies on the sale of fresh produce, such as vegetables, fruit, livestock and poultry meat, and aquatic products. For example, the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Quality and Safety in the Marketing of Edible Agricultural Products, effective from December 2023, comprehensively prohibit sellers from using lighting facilities that significantly change the true colour of live and fresh edible agricultural products (commonly known as ""fresh food lighting""); and the national standard on Restricting Excessive Packaging Requirements of Fresh Edible Agricultural Products, effective from April last year, which imposes stringent regulations on the interspace ratio, number of layers and cost ratio of the packaging of such products. Regarding the regulation of the sale of fresh produce, will the Government inform this Council of the following:

(1) whether reference will be made to the above measures in the Mainland to prohibit the trade from using lighting facilities that affect the true colour of fresh produce;

(2) apart from formulating guidelines on product packaging reduction (for example, Practical Guides on Packaging Reduction And Management developed by the Environmental Protection Department for specific sectors), whether the Government will consider following the Mainland's practice of restricting the excessive packaging of locally produced fresh produce;

(3) whether it will optimise its policy to enhance the transparency of the fresh produce retail market by making reference to the good regulatory experience of the Mainland or overseas countries, and maintain a level playing field in the business environment, thereby facilitating the healthy development of the industry and boosting consumers' confidence; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) whether it has established a mechanism to regularly assess the effectiveness of the existing policy on regulating the sale of fresh produce; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) given the views that the supply chain of fresh produce is complex, whether the Government has plans to establish a comprehensive traceability system for fresh produce (including fresh produce not supplied locally), so as to enable consumers to clearly ascertain information such as the origin and farm names of such food products through reliable channels, preventing counterfeit and substandard products from entering the market, while at the same time enabling high-quality business operators to gain market recognition?

Reply:

President,

 Having consulted the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, I provide the following reply to the questions on ""fresh food lighting"" and other related issues raised by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee:

(1) and (3) Regarding the regulation of fresh provision shops selling fresh food, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has put in place a well-established regulatory regime for safeguarding food safety and public health. For details, please refer to parts (4) and (5) of the ensuing reply.

 On protection of consumers' rights and interests, there are currently various laws in Hong Kong for safeguarding the rights and interests of consumers. Among others, the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (Cap. 362) prohibits traders from subjecting consumers to unfair trade practices, with the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) as its principal enforcement agency. Meanwhile, the Consumer Council (the Council) endeavours to study and promote the protection of consumers' rights and interests, including handling consumers' complaints on goods and services. Consumers may report to the C&ED or file complaints with the Council against suspected unfair trade practices employed by traders in the provision of fresh food.

(2) Hong Kong's supply of fresh food is primarily imported, with packaging largely conducted outside the city, making the regulation of packaging materials and methods for fresh food relatively complex. Relatively speaking, it is more pragmatic to encourage the trade to reduce food packaging or do it in a more environmentally-friendly way. To this end, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) launched the Packaging Reduction Charter on March 31 this year to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable packaging reduction practices. These include reviewing their packaging designs to minimise unnecessary material use, enhancing the recyclability and reusability of packaging, as well as exploring other innovative solutions. Hitherto, 128 businesses have signed the charter, with 20 of them related to the fresh food retailing and food manufacturing sectors, pledging reduction in packaging usage.

 In addition, to assist the trades in enhancing packaging management, the EPD formulated the Practical Guides on Packaging Reduction and Management for their reference. The set of Guides covers sectors relevant to fresh food, such as ""Supermarkets and Grocery Stores"" and ""Food Manufacturing"". In parallel, the EPD promotes simple packaging and waste reduction at source, and encourages green business and consumption through publicity and education (e.g. workshops, seminars and websites). The EPD will continue to closely monitor the effectiveness of packaging reduction measures across various sectors.

(4) and (5) The CFS has established an effective food safety regulatory mechanism covering stages of import, wholesale and retail to ensure that food (including fresh food) available for sale in Hong Kong are safe for consumption.

 Certain high-risk food such as game, meat, poultry and eggs must come from sources recognised by the FEHD. Checking of import documents and surveillance at import control points are conducted by the CFS at the time of food import. In addition, the Food Safety Ordinance (Cap. 612) has established a food tracing mechanism, which provides that any person engaged in the food business shall maintain records of the movements of food, including the date the food was acquired, the name and contact details of the seller, the place from which the food was imported, and the total quantity and description of the food. The relevant provisions ensure that the Government can promptly and effectively trace the source of food and take corresponding follow-up actions in case of a food incident.

 The CFS implements the Food Surveillance Programme to collect food samples (including those of fresh food) for testing at the import, wholesale and retail/catering levels under a risk-based principle on an ongoing basis, and takes corresponding enforcement actions against unsatisfactory surveillance results. In 2024, the CFS tested about 66900 samples for regular surveillance and the overall satisfactory rate was 99.8 per cent.

 The CFS has also been closely monitoring food incidents, both local and elsewhere. Based on factors such as risk level, legal requirements and whether the concerned food products are sold in Hong Kong, the CFS decides on the appropriate risk management actions. If necessary, the CFS will communicate with health authorities, importers, distributors and retailers of the region(s) concerned on the food incidents, and take corresponding actions such as requesting the trade to stop selling such products, conducting tests as and when appropriate, issuing directions to the trade and directing a food recall. The CFS will issue rapid alert to traders to inform them of the latest situation. It will also issue press releases to give advice to consumers if the food incidents are of public health concern to the local population.

 Regarding the regulation of fresh provision shops selling fresh food, the Food Business Regulation (Cap. 132X) stipulates that any person who intends to sell fresh, chilled or frozen beef, mutton, pork, reptiles (including live snake), fish (including live fish) and poultry at any premises in the territory must obtain a fresh provision shop licence issued by the FEHD before commencement of such business. Also, a trained and qualified full-time Hygiene Supervisor must be appointed to monitor food safety and hygiene at premises in accordance with licence conditions. The FEHD conducts regular risk-based inspections of licensed fresh provision shops to ensure that licensees comply with licensing requirements and conditions as well as hygiene standards prescribed under the law. Where breaches of licence conditions are identified, the FEHD will issue verbal or written warnings and consider revoking licences in serious cases. In addition to implementing regulatory measures, the FEHD provides ongoing health education to licensees, including the dissemination of food safety and health advice to licensees and their staff during regular inspections of premises, and the organisation of food hygiene talks, seminars and workshops to enhance the trade's standards in food safety and hygiene."
LCQ13: Support for Hong Kong elderly persons retiring in Mainland,2025-09-25 12:45,2025-09-25 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500616.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Sunny Tan and a written reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 The Government introduced the Guangdong (GD) Scheme and the Fujian (FJ) Scheme in 2013 and 2018 respectively to enable eligible Hong Kong elderly persons who choose to retire in GD or FJ Provinces to receive an Old Age Allowance or an Old Age Living Allowance without having to return to Hong Kong every year. Regarding support for Hong Kong elderly persons retiring in the Mainland, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that according to government figures, 26 592 and 2 542 elderly persons had enrolled in GD Scheme and FJ Scheme respectively as at June this year, while data from the Census and Statistics Department and the Fuzhou population census show that in 2020, around 90 000 Hong Kong elderly persons were residing long-term in GD Province and 1 667 in Fuzhou of FJ Province alone, and there are views that the relevant statistics reflect that many Hong Kong elderly persons retiring in GD and FJ Provinces do not intend to apply for the two schemes, whether the Government has examined the reasons behind this; whether it has studied how to enhance complementary policy measures and support to address the concerns of elderly persons, thereby attracting more elderly persons intending to retire in GD and FJ Provinces to apply for the two schemes;

(2) as the authorities announced in May this year the extension of the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme (EHCV Pilot Scheme) to cover all nine Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and indicated that they would consider implementing the scheme in other locations (such as FJ Province) after assessing the effectiveness of EHCV Pilot Scheme, of the progress of the relevant work; and

(3) as the authorities announced in March this year the extension of the Pilot Scheme for Supporting Patients of the Hospital Authority in the GBA (SPHA Pilot Scheme), which enables eligible patients of the Hospital Authority (HA) to receive subsidised consultation services at the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, and the Government has also indicated that it will evaluate the effectiveness of SPHA Pilot Scheme and its scope of services with HA each year and make necessary adjustments in a timely manner, whether the authorities will consider extending SPHA Pilot Scheme to suitable Tier 3 Class A hospitals in other GBA Mainland cities and FJ Province; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 In consultation with the Health Bureau, I reply to the Hon Tan's question as follows:

(1) The current portable cash assistance measures include the Portable Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme under the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme and the Guangdong (GD) Scheme and Fujian (FJ) Scheme under the Social Security Allowance (SSA) Scheme.

 In recent years, the Government has continually improved the SSA Scheme, for instance by merging the Normal and Higher Old Age Living Allowances from September 2022 and relaxing the absence limit of SSA Scheme's pre-application requirement of one-year continuous residence in Hong Kong from September 2023. These enhancements apply to the GD Scheme and FJ Scheme. Over the past three years, the total number of beneficiaries under the GD Scheme and FJ Scheme has risen by approximately 30 per cent: beneficiaries of the GD Scheme increased from 19509 in 2021-22 to 26077 in 2024-25; and beneficiaries of the FJ Scheme increased from 1963 in 2021-22 to 2510 in 2024-25.

 Hong Kong elderly persons who are planning to retire or have already retired in the GD and FJ Provinces decide on whether to join the GD Scheme or FJ Scheme based on their individual circumstances with varying reasons. The Government does not have relevant information in this regard.

 To assist Hong Kong elderly persons in understanding the above Schemes, the Social Welfare Department (SWD) appoints agents to publicise and promote the Schemes through multiple channels, including putting in place thematic webpages, setting up mobile outreach stations, distributing promotional leaflets and organising sharing sessions. The SWD also provides electronic forms to facilitate online applications by the elderly. If an elderly person is unable to return to Hong Kong for health reasons, the SWD's agents will conduct home visits on the Mainland to help him/her complete the application. The SWD and its agents will continue to promote the Schemes to eligible elderly persons and assist in their applications.

(2) The Government launched the Elderly Health Care Voucher Greater Bay Area Pilot Scheme in 2024, offering more convenience and flexibility to eligible Hong Kong elderly persons by providing more service points in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) for them to better use their Elderly Health Care Vouchers (EHCVs) on primary healthcare services to improve health conditions. Since June 2024, the Government has extended the coverage of EHCVs by phases to seven integrated medical/dental institutions in the Mainland cities in the GBA, covering Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Dongguan and Shenzhen. In May this year, the Government announced an extension of the Pilot Scheme to include 12 additional medical institutions for full coverage of nine Mainland cities in the GBA and the goal was fully achieved in August. Together with the two existing service points operated by the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital (HKU-SZH), eligible elderly persons can use their EHCVs at a total of 21 service points in the Mainland cities in the GBA, benefitting more than 1.78 million eligible Hong Kong elderly persons.

 The extension of the Pilot Scheme to full coverage of nine Mainland cities in the GBA marks another milestone in policy innovation and cross-boundary medical collaboration. The Pilot Scheme is still in its initial operation period. We will continue to assess and monitor the operation and usage of EHCVs in the pilot medical institutions and review the effectiveness of the Pilot Scheme in due course before studying further arrangements.

(3) Under the Pilot Scheme for Supporting Patients of the Hospital Authority in the GBA, eligible patients of the Hospital Authority (HA) may choose to receive subsidised consultation services at designated collaborating healthcare institution in GBA Mainland cities. The Pilot Scheme aims to provide Hong Kong people with more choices when receiving HA's services, and is currently applicable to the HKU-SZH. Building on the Pilot Scheme and targeting specific HA services, the Government will explore the introduction of more healthcare choices of receiving services in the Mainland cities in the GBA for patients with follow-up appointments in the HA. Relevant measures will be rolled out once ready. At present, the Government will focus on identifying suitable Mainland healthcare institutions within the GBA and consider various factors such as the quality of healthcare services, cost-effectiveness, as well as cross-boundary laws and regulations, in accordance with the principle of complementarity and mutual benefits with the Mainland."
立法會十六題：打擊販賣偽造香港證明文件,2025-09-25 12:33,2025-09-25 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500560.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上謝偉俊議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據報有商戶透過內地電商平台，兜售五花八門偽造的香港通用證件，當中包括大專院校學生證、畢業證書、香港身份證、紀律部隊委任證、不同俱樂部泊車貼，甚至仿製封閉道路通行許可證（禁區紙）也可供選購。此外，有傳媒發現內地網購平台有大量商戶，售賣香港水、電、煤氣帳單、供客戶用作地址證明的造假糧單及租約，有賣家甚至在假帳單上使用真實存在的香港地址資料，更指住戶不知地址已被盜用。有意見認為，上述林林總總、難辨真偽虛假香港證明、帳單文件的販賣活動已達嚴重泛濫程度；同時，現任中國人民政治協商會議全國委員會（全國政協）副主席暨前行政長官亦在其個人社交媒體撰文指「誠信、商譽、守法意識是香港賴以為生優勢，任何假冒和香港相關東西都應下架」，並呼籲涉事內地電商平台「發財立品，不能損害全體中國商人聲譽」。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）就內地商戶違法販賣本港假證和假帳單情況，除上述全國政協副主席暨前特首親自督促外，政府有何應對政策；

（二）有否調查上述販賣假證和假帳單情況是否已導致大量不法分子在港行騙、入學、就業、開設銀行或金融帳戶或騙取社會服務及福利情況；如有，詳情為何，以及有否成功起訴個案；

（三）據報今年上半年累計近千名專上學生被騙逾一億元，港漂學生佔半數，當局有否調查或評估，眾多涉及內地來港人士被騙巨額款項案件，與在港使用假證或假帳單的關連性，例如是否有人曾在港使用偽造執法人員證件行騙，甚或有受害人以虛假證明入職公司或入讀院校後，非法轉移內地資金來港，因懼怕內地執法機關查究而墮入騙局；如有，當局曾偵破多少宗同類案件；

（四）有何措施或政策，以捍衞上述「香港賴以為生優勢」及保護本港誠信、商譽和守法意識，並設法令內地電商平台「發財立品」，杜絕所有涉及假冒本港證明文件的商品；及

（五）有否研究或評估，上述販賣假證、假文件行為猖獗，連同假冬蟲夏草種子、冒牌飲用水及冒牌牆磚等數之不盡售港的假貨品，以及眾多被揭發使用偽造學歷文件的學生和專才，對本港多年來一直奉行的「誠信制度」（honour system）帶來何等衝擊；當局日後制訂政策時，會否一改以往以信任為本的觀念，以加強防範有關不法行為？

答覆：

主席：

詐騙乃嚴重罪行。任何人干犯《盜竊罪條例》（第210章）第16A條「欺詐罪」，最高可判處監禁14年；若被控同一條例第17條「以欺騙手段取得財產」，最高可判處監禁10年。《刑事罪行條例》（第200章）第71至75條訂明製造、使用或管有虛假文書最高可判監禁14年。另外，任何人因詐騙得益而被控《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章） 第25條「處理已知道或相信為代表從可公訴罪行的得益的財產」，最高可判處監禁14年及罰款500萬元。

無論騙案發生於線上或線下、透過任何方式進行，只要涉及違法行為，政府都會嚴正執法，絕不姑息。

就議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府留意到近日有商戶經網上平台售賣偽造證件等疑似虛假文書。我們高度關注此等懷疑違法行為。

首先，利用虛假文書行騙或干犯上述的《盜竊罪條例》（第210章），最高可判處監禁14年。另外，根據《刑事罪行條例》（第200章），製造、出售或使用虛假文書（包括題述的偽造證件、證書、帳單、租約等）均屬嚴重罪行。任何人製造虛假文書，或在知道或相信某虛假文書屬虛假的情況下使用或管有該文書或其副本，並意圖誘使另一人接受該文書為真文書，並因而作出或不作某些作為，以致對該另一人或其他人不利，一經定罪，最高可處監禁14年。

事實上，香港警務處一直就偽造文件相關罪案嚴厲執法。二○二五年一至七月，警方共接獲546宗涉及偽造文件的案件，共拘捕337人。在二○二五年第一季，共有46宗就相關罪行提出的案件完成審訊，定罪率約為85%。

針對製造及行使虛假香港身份證的跨境罪行，警方於八月聯同香港入境事務處（入境處）及內地相關執法部門採取聯合行動，在兩地共拘捕42人，並在深圳搗破一個偽造香港身份證製造場所，搜獲60多張偽造證件製成品、製造偽證原材料及工具。

過去警方一直與內地公安機關緊密合作，並已建立情報互換機制，以打擊相關的跨境罪行。警方早前注意到懷疑有不法商人在內地網上平台出售涉及香港的偽造證件、帳單等，已即時將相關資料通報內地公安機關要求涉事平台迅速行動，移除相關帖文並作進一步跟進。警方雖暫時未觀察到這類犯案手法有明顯增長的趨勢，但我們絕不會掉以輕心。警方會持續留意這類犯案手法，並繼續與內地相關部門保持緊密合作，打擊相關罪行。

（三）新來港人士因為不熟悉本港的制度、騙案情況、求助方法等，較容易受騙，尤其是當中的內地來港就讀的學生。假冒政府人員是其中一個針對此類群組常見的詐騙技倆。就此類詐騙行為（不論是否涉及偽造政府人員工作證），警方一直嚴厲執法。警方於二○二五年一至八月接獲584宗涉及假冒政府人員的騙案，較去年同期減少10.2%，損失金額更大幅下跌64.7%，反映警方的各類防騙工作奏效。

除了執法行動外，提高市民防騙意識亦至關重要。在宣傳教育方面，警方針對不同群組制訂不同具針對性的防騙策略。警方早前與國家移民管理局、公安部刑偵局及香港入境處共同製作防騙視頻，展示騙徒假冒政府人員的犯案手法，提高新來港人士的警惕，並自二○二五年六月起在各口岸、內地出入境辦證大廳，以及小紅書、抖音等社交媒體播放。

為特別加強保護新來港學生，警方與國家反詐中心安排線上線下學生及家長分享會，並向家長派發防騙須知信息。為繼續加強他們抵港後的宣傳教育，警方早前與香港理工大學合作進行有關大學生詐騙認知的調查，收集逾3 000份回覆，發現近85%受訪者曾參與網上防騙教育套件，當中內地生參與率超過90%，而曾完成學習套件的學生遭遇詐騙而有金錢損失的比率比未曾參與者低58%。警方會繼續協調各院校安排新生參與。

自今年新學年開始，警方已走訪各大學進行反詐宣傳。警務處處長早前亦透過全港大專院校去信新來港學生及他們的家長，呼籲他們要特別留意幾類常見行騙手法，以及防範的方法，並鼓勵他們善用警方的「防騙易熱線」及「防騙視伏App」。

（四）及（五）政府致力鞏固香港購物天堂的地位。為保持消費者在香港購物的信心，香港有不同的法例保障消費者權益。香港海關（海關）是《商品說明條例》的主要執法機關，除了一直透過執法行動打擊不良營商手法，亦積極推行合規推廣及宣傳教育。就打擊網上侵權罪行，海關設有反互聯網盜版隊專責進行網絡調查，並以自動網上監察系統24小時進行網上巡邏及偵測網上的侵權活動，另外如證實有人於網上交易平台出售侵權物品，海關會要求該平台移除涉及侵權活動的帖文。

就涉及虛假陳述及欺詐行為，包括上文已詳述的涉及製造、使用或管有虛假文書的違法行為，各相關執法部門必定嚴肅跟進，將不法之徒繩之於法。

反詐工作有賴全社會（包括政府、機構及個人層面）齊心協力，共同築起反詐防線，時刻提高警覺，並採取一切可行的措施，不讓騙徒有機可乘。市民如發現有任何可疑情況，應即時向警方作出舉報，警方必定嚴肅跟進。政府亦呼籲任何人切勿因一時貪念以身試法。"
LCQ16: Combating sales of forged Hong Kong certification documents,2025-09-25 12:33,2025-09-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500566.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Paul Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 It has been reported that some merchants offer for sale a wide variety of forged Hong Kong general certification documents, including tertiary institution student cards, graduation certificates, Hong Kong identity cards, warrant cards of disciplined services, parking permit stickers of various clubs and even counterfeit Closed Road Permits ( Closed Area Permit) on Mainland e-commerce platforms. In addition, some media have uncovered that there are numerous merchants on Mainland e-commerce platforms offering false Hong Kong utility bills for water, electricity and gas, along with fabricated pay slips and tenancies for use as proof of address. Some sellers even use genuine Hong Kong address information on such false bills. It is also pointed out that residents are unaware that their addresses have been stolen. There are views that the sale of such diverse, hard-to-verify false Hong Kong certification documents and bills has become seriously prevalent. At the same time, on his personal social media, the current Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and former Chief Executive of Hong Kong wrote that ""integrity, business reputation and law-abiding awareness are the advantages upon which Hong Kong relies for its survival. Any counterfeit Hong Kong-related items should be removed from shelves."" He also called on the involved Mainland e-commerce platforms to ""make money with integrity and not to damage the reputation of all Chinese merchants."" In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) regarding Mainland merchants' illegal sale of false Hong Kong certification documents and bills, apart from the aforesaid urge made personally by the Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC and former Chief Executive, of the Government's policies to address the issue;

(2) whether any investigation has been conducted into whether the aforesaid sale of false certification documents and bills has led to a large number of lawbreakers committing fraud, enrolling in schools, engaging in employment, opening bank or financial accounts, or obtaining social services and benefits in Hong Kong; if investigation has been conducted, of the details, and whether any successful prosecutions have been made;

(3) as it has been reported that nearly a thousand post-secondary students were defrauded of over $100 million in the first half of this year, with ""Hong Kong drifter"" students making up half of the victims, whether the authorities have investigated or assessed the connection between numerous cases involving people coming to Hong Kong from the Mainland being defrauded of substantial amounts of money and the use of false certification documents or bills, such as whether anyone used forged law enforcement credentials to commit fraud in Hong Kong, or whether any victims, after gaining employment or admission to institutions using false certification documents, illegally transferred Mainland funds to Hong Kong, thus falling into scams out of fear of investigations by Mainland law enforcement agencies; if the authorities have, of the number of similar cases detected;

(4) of the measures or policies in place to safeguard the aforesaid ""advantages upon which Hong Kong relies for its survival"" and protect Hong Kong's integrity, business reputation and law-abiding awareness, and to ensure that Mainland e-commerce platforms will ""make money with integrity"" and eliminate all goods involving false Hong Kong certification documents; and

(5) whether any research or assessment has been conducted on how the aforesaid rampant sale of false certificates and documents and countless counterfeit goods sold in Hong Kong such as false Cordyceps seeds, counterfeit drinking water and counterfeit wall tiles, as well as many students and professionals found to have used forged academic documents, have impacted the ""honour system"" upheld by Hong Kong for years; whether the authorities will change from the previous trust-based philosophy when formulating policies in the future, so as to strengthen safeguards against such illegal activities?

Reply:

President,

 Deception is a serious crime. Any person who commits the offence of ""fraud"" under section 16A of the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years, while any person charged with ""obtaining property by deception"" under section 17 of the same Ordinance is liable to imprisonment for up to 10 years. Sections 71 to 75 of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200) provide that the maximum penalty for making, using or possessing a false instrument is imprisonment for 14 years. In addition, any person charged with ""dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" under section 25 of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) for proceeds of deception is liable to maximum penalties of 14 years' imprisonment and a fine of $5 million.

 Regardless of whether deception takes place online or offline and the tactics used, the Government will take stern enforcement actions and there will be no tolerance as long as there are illegal activities involved.

 The reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) The Government has noticed that some merchants have been selling forged certification documents and other suspected false instruments via online platforms recently. We express great concern over such suspected illegal activities.

 Firstly, using a false instrument to deceive or committing the aforesaid offences under the Theft Ordinance (Cap. 210) carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. In addition, under the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200), making, selling or using a false instrument (including forged certification documents, certificates, bills and tenancies as mentioned in the question) is a serious crime. A person who makes a false instrument, or uses or possesses an instrument (or a copy of it) which is and which he knows or believes to be false, with the intention to induce somebody to accept it as genuine and, as a result, to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person's prejudice, is liable on conviction to imprisonment for up to 14 years.

 As a matter of fact, the Hong Kong Police Force has been taking stringent enforcement actions against crimes relating to forgery of documents. From January to July 2025, the Police received a total of 546 cases involving forgery of documents and arrested 337 persons. In the first quarter of 2025, trials for 46 cases initiated in respect of relevant crimes were concluded. The conviction rate was about 85 per cent.

 Targeting cross-border crimes involving the making and using of false Hong Kong identity cards (HKICs), the Police conducted an operation in collaboration with the Hong Kong Immigration Department (ImmD) and relevant law enforcement agencies of the Mainland in August, arresting a total of 42 persons in the Mainland and Hong Kong. A production base of forged HKICs was smashed in Shenzhen, where some 60 finished items of forged certification documents, as well as raw materials and tools for producing forged documents, were seized.

 The Police have all long maintained close co-operation with Mainland public security authorities and established an intelligence exchange mechanism to combat relevant cross-border crimes. The Police recently noticed and suspected that some unscrupulous merchants were selling forged certification documents and bills of Hong Kong on Mainland online platforms. Mainland public security authorities were immediately notified of such, and the platforms concerned were requested to act promptly to remove the relevant posts and take further follow up actions. While the Police have not observed a significant upward trend in this modus operandi at this stage, we will not let our guard down. The Police will continue to pay attention to such modus operandi and maintain close co-operation with relevant Mainland authorities to combat these crimes.

(3) New arrivals to Hong Kong, in particular Mainland students coming to Hong Kong for studies, are more prone to becoming victims of fraud because they are unfamiliar with Hong Kong's systems, fraud situation and ways of seeking help. Impersonating government officials is one of the common tactics employed to defraud this group. To tackle such fraudulent activities (whether forged identification cards of government officials are involved or not), the Police have been taking stringent enforcement actions. From January to August 2025, the Police received 584 fraud cases involving impersonation of government officials, which represents a decrease of 10.2 per cent from the same period last year. The monetary loss incurred has significantly dropped by 64.7 per cent, showing the effectiveness of the Police's fraud prevention efforts on all fronts.

 Besides law enforcement, raising public awareness is also of vital importance. On publicity and education, the Police have devised targeted anti-fraud strategies for various groups. In collaboration with the National Immigration Administration, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and the ImmD, the Police have produced anti-fraud video clips showing the modus operandi of fraudsters impersonating government officials, with a view to heightening the alertness of the new arrivals. Starting from June 2025, the videos are broadcast across boundary control points, exit-entry service halls in the Mainland as well as social media platforms including Xiaohongshu and Douyin.

 To provide strengthened protection particularly for students who newly arrive in Hong Kong, the Police and the National Anti-Fraud Center have jointly organised both online and offline sharing sessions for the students and their parents. Informative materials on fraud prevention have also been distributed to parents. To continue to step up publicity and education for them after their arrival, the Police have collaborated with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University to conduct a survey on the awareness of fraud among university students earlier. Of the over 3 000 replies collected, it was found that nearly 85 per cent of the respondents have enrolled in the anti-scam online learning package, with the participation rate of Mainland students exceeding 90 per cent. For students who had completed the learning package, the number who fell prey to fraud and suffered monetary loss were 58 per cent lower than those who had never enrolled in the learning package. The Police will continue to co-ordinate with institutions and arrange for new students' enrolment in the learning package.

 Since the beginning of this new school year, the Police have visited various universities to carry out anti-fraud publicity campaigns. Earlier on, the Commissioner of Police has also sent a letter to the newly arrived students and their parents through all tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, urging them to pay particular attention to several common fraud tactics and advising them of ways to guard against such fraud. They are also encouraged to make good use of the Police's Anti Scam Helpline and ""Scameter+"".

(4) and (5) The Government is committed to consolidating Hong Kong's status as a shopping paradise. To maintain consumers' confidence in shopping in Hong Kong, there are various laws in Hong Kong to protect consumers' rights and interests. The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), being the principal enforcement agency of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, carries out compliance promotion as well as publicity and education in addition to enforcement actions, with a view to combating unfair trade practices. To combat online infringement crimes, the C&ED has an Anti-Internet Piracy Team in place specifically responsible for conducting online investigations. It also operates automated online monitoring systems to conduct 24-hour online patrols and detect online infringing activities. When the sale of infringing items on online trading platforms is confirmed, the C&ED will request the removal of posts involving infringing activities from the platforms.

 As regards the acts of false statement and fraud, including illegal activities involving the making, using or possessing of a false instrument as elaborated above, relevant law enforcement agencies will follow up on every case stringently to bring the criminals to justice.

 The fight against fraud counts on the concerted efforts of the entire society (on the levels of the Government, organisations and individuals) to build an anti-fraud barrier, stay vigilant at all times and take every practicable measure to leave no chance for the fraudsters. When suspicious circumstances are identified, the public should immediately report to the Police, which will take follow-up actions seriously. The Government also reminds all members of the public not to commit any offence out of momentary greed."
LCQ17: Restaurants at rural and remote attractions,2025-09-25 12:30,2025-09-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500509.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Mrs Regina Ip and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  There are views pointing out that tourism experiences at quite a number of rural and remote tourist attractions are impacted by a lack of nearby restaurants for visitors to dine in. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the numbers of existing licensed restaurants at rural attractions in Outlying Islands, North District, Sai Kung, Sha Tin and Yuen Long, as well as at remote attractions in Southern District, together with a breakdown by licence type; if it has not kept such figures, of the reasons for that;

(2) of the respective numbers of applications received and approved by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) over the past three years for various types of restaurant licences concerning the attractions in the districts mentioned in (1);

(3) of the respective numbers of applications received, approved and rejected by the FEHD over the past three years for various types of restaurant licences concerning Shek O, Sha Tau Kok, Cheung Sha, Pui O and Pak Nai, and the reasons for application rejection;

(4) whether the Government has currently formulated measures to attract tourists to visit restaurants at rural and remote attractions, such as expediting improvements to transport and communication network facilities in those areas; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) given that the Government proposed in the 2020 Policy Address that the Countryside Conservation Office work with relevant bureaux/departments to jointly develop a set of licensing requirements and procedural guidelines designed especially for guesthouses and catering business in countryside areas, making reference to the special nature and restrictions of rural settings, of the current work progress and the expected time for introducing such requirements and guidelines?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the the Transport and Logistics Bureau, and the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the reply to the question raised by the Hon Mrs Regina Ip is as follow:

(1) As at August 31, 2025, the number of restaurant licences in Southern District, Islands, North District, Sai Kung, Sha Tin, and Yuen Long are tabulated below. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) does not maintain breakdown of statistics of restaurants located in remote areas of each district:

Note: The applications approved might not be received in the same year.

(3) Between 2022 and August 31, 2025, the FEHD received four restaurant licence applications at rural tourist spots in Islands, North District, Sai Kung, Sha Tin, Yuen Long, and remote locations in Southern District. An application for a restaurant licence in Sha Tau Kok has been approved; another one in Cheung Sha was considered withdrawn due to failure of the applicant to remove unauthorised structures as required by relevant departments; and two snack shop licence applications in Shek O are still being processed.

(4) The Government attaches importance to enhancing transportation and telecommunication network in remote countryside area. At present, many hiking spots located away from the city centre are connected by well-developed public transport services and road network. The Transport Department (TD) has been closely monitoring the transport needs across various districts and coordinating with service providers to arrange public transport services for numerous hiking attractions located away from the city centre, for example, kaito ferry services to and from islands near the Sai Kung waters, to facilitate access by the public and visitors to these attractions. Regarding other more remote countryside area, the TD will consider the road network and actual situation and conditions to arrange public transport services as appropriate to transport visitors to locations near these attractions. Furthermore, in Yan Chau Tong areas, to improve accessibility to popular rural attractions, ferry services running from Sha Tau Kok and Tai Shui Hang to Lai Chi Wo, Kat O and Ap Chau, etc., have been enhanced gradually in the past two years through coordination between the Government and the local communities. The Countryside Conservation Office is also reviewing means to improve accessibility to Kuk Po. These initiatives seek to benefit villagers, tourists and local food business operators.

  On telecommunications networks, the Office of the Communications Authority launched the Subsidy Scheme to Extend 5G Coverage in Rural and Remote Areas in July 2025 to subsidise mobile network operators to establish around 50 radio base stations in various rural area across Hong Kong. In addition, the Government will continue to implement the Subsidy Scheme to Extend Fibre-based Networks to Villages in Remote Areas. The new fibre-based networks are expected to be extended to a total of 235 villages in the New Territories and outlying islands by 2026, further strengthening network coverage in rural area.

(5) To promote eco-tourism, facilitate visitors and help revitalise desolate villages, the Government set up the inter-departmental Task Force on Guesthouse and Food Business Licences in Countryside Areas and formulated a series of streamlined measures to facilitate licence applications for the countryside villages in the New Territories that have no vehicular access taking into account the uniqueness of remote countryside.These streamlined measures cover various aspects, including town planning, land, fire safety, building safety and sanitary requirements, and have facilitated the successful grant of food business licences to the operators in Kuk Po and Yim Tin Tsai, Sai Kung.

  The Task Force is sorting out the details and implementation procedures of the streamlined measures and compiling a set of Guide to Application with its official release scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025. The Government will continue to review opportunities for further enhancement of the licence application process for food business in countryside area, with a view to creating a more business-friendly environment there and promoting countryside conservation and revitalisation."

註：獲批的申請未必是於同年遞交。

（三）在二○二二年至二○二五年八月三十一日期間，食環署共接獲四宗來自離島、北區、西貢、沙田和元朗的鄉郊景點，以及南區偏遠景點的食物業牌照申請。一宗位於沙頭角的普通食肆牌照申請已經獲批；一宗位於長沙的普通食肆牌照申請因申請人一直未有按相關部門要求清拆違規構築物，因而被視作撤消；另有兩宗位於石澳的小食食肆牌照申請仍在處理中。

（四）政府致力改善偏遠鄉郊地區的交通及通訊網絡配套。現時，不少遠離市中心的郊遊景點，已有發展成熟的公共交通服務和道路網絡連接。運輸署一直密切留意各地區的交通需求，並協調服務營辦商為不少遠離市區的郊遊景點提供公共交通服務，例如往返西貢水域附近島嶼的街渡渡輪服務，方便市民和旅客前往這些景點。至於其他較偏遠的鄉郊地方，運輸署會考慮道路網絡和實際環境和情況，盡力安排適切的公共交通服務，接載訪客前往景點的附近位置。此外，在印洲塘一帶，為改善當地鄉郊熱門景點的暢達性，在政府與當地社區共同協調下，已經在過去兩年逐步提升由沙頭角及大水坑往來荔枝窩、吉澳及鴨洲等的渡輪服務；鄉郊保育辦公室亦正研究如何改善前往谷埔的方法，期望能為村民、遊客以至當地的食肆經營者帶來裨益。

在通訊網絡方面，通訊事務管理局辦公室已於二○二五年七月推出「擴展5G網絡至鄉郊及偏遠地區資助計劃」，資助流動網絡營辦商於全港不同鄉郊地區設置約50個無線電基站。政府亦會繼續推展「擴展光纖網絡至偏遠地區鄉村資助計劃」，新建的光纖網絡將於二○二六年內完成拓展至新界及離島地區共235條鄉村，加強鄉郊地區的網絡覆蓋。

（五）為促進生態旅遊、利便訪客和協助活化荒僻村落，政府成立了跨部門的「鄉郊地區賓館及食物業牌照工作小組」，為現時位於新界偏遠鄉郊、沒有車路連接的鄉郊村落，因應偏遠鄉郊地區的獨特性，制訂一系列涵蓋城市規劃、土地、消防安全、樓宇安全及衞生等方面的牌照申請優化措施，並促成在谷埔及西貢鹽田梓的個案成功取得食物業牌照。

「工作小組」現正梳理相關便利措施的細節和執行步驟，並會將其匯編成一套《申請指引》，預計二○二五年第四季公開發布。政府會持續檢視鄉郊地區食物業牌照申領過程的優化空間，為鄉郊地區締造更友善的營商環境，支持鄉郊保育和活化的工作。"
​立法會九題：便利旅行團的交通措施,2025-09-25 12:28,2025-09-25 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500542.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上姚柏良議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

關於便利旅行團的交通措施，政府可否告知本會：

（一） 鑑於有旅遊業界人士反映，香園圍口岸經常出現擠塞，影響旅客體驗，政府有否研究於今年國慶節假期前，在該口岸實施短期的交通紓緩措施，例如容許接載出境旅行團的旅遊巴士可在出境樓層落客，以避免地面公共交通交匯處出現人潮和車輛擠塞的情況；

（二） 鑑於有旅遊業界人士認為，目前大部分旅行團選擇過境的香園圍口岸的日均出入境人次已達其設計容量三倍，加快沙頭角口岸重建以便利旅行團出入境及交通往來迫在眉睫，而據悉重建後的沙頭角口岸將定位為純旅檢口岸，有關工程的具體時間表為何；

（三）鑑於今年是抗戰勝利80周年，有不少旅遊業界人士反映，沙頭角周邊的鹿頸路限制旅遊巴士駛入，阻礙旅行團參觀抗戰遺蹟，當局會否加快改善該道路的基建設施；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（四） 鑑於業界人士指出，西貢萬宜水庫東壩深受旅客歡迎，但由於該處實施交通管制，每天可簽發的29座以下旅遊巴士服務許可證配額僅限三張，而且申請手續繁複，在人流較多的周末和公眾假期批出許可證的機會極低，以致業界難以打造旅遊產品，當局會否進一步增加旅遊巴士進入東壩的配額，以便利業界規劃旅行團路線，提升生態遊旅客的體驗；及

（五）鑑於啟德體育園在大型盛事期間實施限制，持出租汽車許可證車輛及旅遊巴士（即屬遊覽服務（A01）牌照的非專營巴士）未能進入主場館範圍，不利於業界打造「盛事+旅遊」產品，政府會否放寬有關交通管制，並設立預約機制，讓該兩類牌照車輛可停靠在主場館下的旅遊巴士泊車位或園區其他合適位置，從而提升旅客體驗？

答覆：

主席：

隨着旅客來往內地與香港愈趨頻繁，政府持續密切監察各陸路邊境管制站和各區包括旅遊熱點的人流及車流情況，協調相關部門和營辦商做好人流疏導和交通管理安排。

就姚議員提問的各部分，經諮詢文化體育及旅遊局、環境及生態局、保安局和運輸署後，現回覆如下：

（一）香園圍管制站（下稱「管制站」）是一個採用「人車直達」設計的通關口岸，自二○二三年二月旅檢服務啟用以來，一直深受跨境旅客歡迎，人流持續上升。管制站設有公共運輸交匯處、旅遊巴士上落客區（下稱「上落客區」）、跨境巴士上落客區、私家車上落客區及公眾停車場等配套設施，以配合跨境旅客不同的出行模式及乘車需要。其中，上落客區包括九個停車灣位，供本地非專營巴士（包括旅遊巴士）專用。

運輸署一直留意旅遊巴士在管制站使用上落客區的情況，並不時進行實地調查。該上落客區位於管制站地面樓層，根據運輸署觀察所得，現時旅遊巴士使用上落客區的安排可滿足相關旅客的需求，我們留意到載送內地旅行團前往管制站過關離港的旅遊巴士，主要集中在下午及晚上時段使用上落客區。上落客區停車位在這些時段的人潮和車流大致暢順，沒有造成擠塞的情況，而且上落客區有足夠的剩餘停車灣位供旅遊巴士使用，於今年農曆新年和五一黃金周亦足以滿足需求。就有關提問中建議進一步考慮容許本地旅遊巴士使用跨境巴士上落客區（設於管制站一樓樓層出境部分），由於該處的道路設計只能讓跨境巴士在落客後直接駛至車輛檢查亭辦理離境手續，並未設置車輛掉頭設施，故此未必適合供旅遊巴士使用。

一如既往，運輸署會與口岸部門在國慶節假期期間密切留意管制站的整體交通車流，以及旅遊巴士上落客區的運作情況，並會在有需要時加強人流管理措施和彈性處理旅遊巴士上落客安排，以確保整體運作暢順。

（二）為了提升通關效率及推動沙頭角一帶的發展，特區政府和深圳市政府於二○二四年達成共識，以「跨河建」的安排重建沙頭角口岸，即雙方同步建設橫跨沙頭角河的旅檢大樓，以河中心為界緊鄰布置各自的旅檢查驗通道。重建後的沙頭角口岸將成為純旅檢口岸，取消貨檢功能以配合落實跨境貨運「東進東出、西進西出」的布局，即跨境貨車須改用東部蓮塘／香園圍口岸和西部深圳灣口岸，其他陸路口岸則主力處理客運。重建後的沙頭角口岸並會實施「合作查驗、一次放行」的通關模式，進一步提升旅客過關體驗及效率。

香港特別行政區（特區）政府聘請的顧問公司正為沙頭角口岸重建項目進行工程可行性研究，有關研究預計於二○二五年內完成。研究範圍包括重建沙頭角口岸所涉及的土地範圍、道路及基礎設施、交通影響評估、環境和文物保育等事項。

我們了解深圳方正同步積極籌備沙頭角口岸重建項目的設計招標及相關可行性研究工作。特區政府會繼續與深圳市政府緊密合作，積極推進重建項目。

（三）鹿頸路彎多、路面狹窄，基於現場環境所限及交通安全的考慮，鹿頸路現時全日禁止重量超過5.5公噸的車輛、巴士、旅遊巴士及公共小型巴士（專線小巴例外）駛入。儘管如此，考慮到區內旅遊發展等出行需要，運輸署會因應交通情況發出禁區許可證，容許29座或以下的旅遊巴於非繁忙時段使用鹿頸路，以照顧一般旅客和旅行團的需求。為方便旅遊業界了解鹿頸路的交通安排，運輸署已透過香港旅遊業議會的網頁向業界發放申請禁區許可證手續等相關資訊。

按運輸署的評估，目前鹿頸路的容量足夠應付整體交通需求，包括申請禁區許可證的車輛需求，運輸署將繼續密切留意附近一帶的交通並作妥善安排。

（四）往萬宜水庫東壩的西貢萬宜路屬一條水務署的「維修用途通道」，主要供水務署和漁農自然護理署（漁護署）作日常運作及維修用途，大部分路段為單線雙程行車，並不適合大量車輛進入。現時市民及遊客可乘坐的士、新界專線小巴第9A號或預先取得漁護署許可的旅遊巴士前往東壩。

目前周末或公眾假期進出東壩的旅遊巴士配額為每天三個，可供持牌旅行社和學校團體向漁護署申請。自今年二月起至八月，水務署和漁護署接獲的配額申請總數共14宗，除兩宗申請因申請機構未有提供所需資料而未能成功獲批外，其餘已全數獲批出，可見相關配額尚未盡用。

為確保郊野公園的可持續綠色旅遊發展及優質遊客體驗，政府正探討各種可行措施，優化西貢東郊野公園管理及萬宜水庫東壩的交通安排。政府會因應東壩旅遊巴許可證的使用情況，適時檢視旅遊巴許可證的配額。

（五）自今年三月一日正式啓用後，啟德體育園已迅速成為大型體育和娛樂盛事的新據點。過去半年的運作，包括入場、離場及交通等各項安排贏得市民和旅客的正面評價。啟德體育園有限公司（營運公司）一直與政府（包括文化體育及旅遊局、運輸署和香港警務處等）和公共交通營運商保持緊密合作，一方面呼籲來往園區的觀眾盡量乘搭公共交通工具，避免駕駛或乘坐私家車；另一方面不斷優化大型活動期間的交通安排，包括早前推出啟德主場館和啟德體藝館部分泊車位的預約服務，以及為私家車使用者增設啟德青年運動場落車處等新安排。

啟德主場館內有合共約80個旅遊巴泊車位和上落客位，營運公司自開幕以來不斷調整使用泊位的安排。現時營運公司將它們分配作三類安排，首先主要提供予預先安排的跨境旅遊巴士之用。另外，營運公司會配合活動主辦方、售票平台和酒店業界為個別活動推出的旅遊產品，安排預先登記的旅遊巴士服務在該處接載旅客（包括過境或不過境旅客）。第三，營運公司也會與香港酒店業主聯會緊密合作，提供旅遊巴泊位予接駁酒店與啟德主場館的旅遊巴在大型活動開始前，並在預先預約的情況下於該處落客，以配合酒店住客需要。有關安排暢順有序。相關政府部門會聯同營運公司持續檢視運作情況，在不影響活動安排和附近交通的前提下，探討是否有空間擴大上述安排，並延伸至其他非專營巴士服務，進一步提升到訪人士的體驗。"
LCQ9: Facilitation measures for tour group transportation,2025-09-25 12:28,2025-09-25 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500551.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Yiu Pak-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  Regarding facilitation measures for tour group transportation, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the tourism industry have relayed that visitor experience is negatively affected by the congestion that often occurs at the Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point (BCP), affecting visitor experience, whether the Government has studied implementing short-term traffic mitigation measures at this BCP before the National Day holidays this year, such as allowing tour coaches carrying outbound tour groups to drop off passengers at the departure level, so as to avoid the occurrence of large crowds and vehicle congestions at the ground-level public transport interchange;

(2) as some members of the tourism industry are of the view that the daily average cross-boundary passenger traffic at the Heung Yuen Wai BCP, which is currently the preferred boundary-crossing for most tour groups, has reached three times its design flow, making it an urgent priority to expedite the redevelopment of the Sha Tau Kok BCP to facilitate boundary crossing and transportation for tour groups, and it is learnt that the redeveloped Sha Tau Kok BCP will be positioned as a passenger-only clearance point, of the specific timetable for the relevant works;

(3) given that this year marks the 80th anniversary of victory in the War of Resistance, and quite a number of members of the tourism industry have relayed that the restrictions on coach access to Luk Keng Road in the vicinity of Sha Tau Kok hinder tour groups from visiting relics of the War of Resistance, whether the authorities will expedite the improvement of the road's infrastructure facilities; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) as members of the industry have pointed out that the East Dam of High Island Reservoir in Sai Kung is very popular among visitors, but the daily quota of prohibited zone permits issued to coaches with 29 seats or less is limited to only three as the traffic control arrangement, and the application procedures are cumbersome with a very low chance of obtaining an approval on weekends and public holidays when visitor flow is relatively high, making it difficult for the industry to develop tourism products, whether the authorities will further increase the quota for tour coaches entering the East Dam, so as to facilitate the industry in planning tour group itineraries while controlling visitor flow through arrangements by travel agencies to enhance the experience of eco-tourists; and

(5) given the restrictions imposed by the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) during mega events, vehicles holding hire car permits and tour coaches (i.e. non-franchised buses with tour service (A01) endorsement) cannot enter the Main Stadium area, which is not conducive to the development of ""mega event + tourism"" products by the industry, whether the Government will relax the relevant traffic restrictions and introduce a reservation system to allow these two types of licensed vehicles to park at the coach parking spaces under the Main Stadium or other suitable locations in KTSP, thereby enhancing visitor experience?

Reply:

President,

  As the flow of travellers between the Mainland and Hong Kong becomes more frequent, the Government has been closely monitoring the flow of people and vehicles at various land boundary control points (BCPs) and various districts, including tourist hotspots, and coordinating with relevant departments and operators to facilitate crowd control and traffic management arrangements.

  In consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), Environment and Ecology Bureau, Security Bureau and the Transport Department (TD), our reply to the various parts of the question as raised by the Hon Yiu Pak-leung is as follows.

(1) Heung Yuen Wai Boundary Control Point (HYWBCP) is a BCP designed with the concept of ""direct access to people and vehicles"". Since the commissioning of passenger clearance services in February 2023, it has been well-received by cross-boundary travellers, with passenger flow continuing to rise. HYWBCP features ancillary facilities including a public transport interchange (PTI), a pick-up/drop-off (PU/DO) area for tourist coaches, a PU/DO area for cross-boundary coaches (CBCs), a private car PU/DO area, and a public car park to accommodate the different travel patterns and transport needs of cross-boundary travellers. Among others, the PU/DO area includes nine stopping places designated for domestic non-franchised buses (DNFB) (including tourist coaches).

  The TD has been monitoring the usage of the DNFB PU/DO area at the HYWBCP and conducting regular on-site inspections. Located on the ground floor of the HYWBCP, the current arrangement for coaches in using the PU/DO area meets the needs of relevant passengers based on the TD's observations. We note that tourist coaches transporting Mainland tour groups to the HYWBCP for departure primarily use the PU/DO area during afternoon and evening hours. During these periods, the flow of people and vehicles at the PU/DO area is generally smooth with no congestion. Moreover, there are sufficient spare stopping places at the PU/DO area for use by tourist coaches, which were also adequate to meet demand during the Chinese New Year and Golden Week in May this year. Regarding the suggestion in the question to further consider allowing local tourist coaches to use the CBC PU/DO area (located in the departure section on the first floor of the HYWBCP), the road design at that location only permits CBCs to proceed directly to the vehicle inspection booths for departure clearance procedures after dropping off passengers. There are no facilities for vehicles to turn around, making it unsuitable for use by tourist coaches.

  As always, the TD will closely monitor the overall traffic flow at the HYWBCP and the operation of the PU/DO area of tourist coaches during the National Day holiday period in collaboration with the port law enforcement agencies. Where necessary, measures to manage passenger flow will be strengthened and flexible arrangements for picking up/ dropping off activities of tourist coaches will be implemented to ensure smooth overall operations.

(2) To enhance clearance efficiency and promote the development of the Sha Tau Kok (STK) area, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government and the Shenzhen Municipal Government reached a consensus in 2024 on adopting a cross-river construction approach in the redevelopment of STK Control Point. Accordingly, the two sides will concurrently construct the passenger clearance building straddling the STK River and will take the centre line of the river as the boundary line to set up their respective passenger clearance channels immediately adjacent to each other. The redeveloped STK Control Point will become a passenger clearance-only control point, with the cargo clearance function being cancelled, in order to facilitate the implementation of the ""East in East out, West in West out"" planning strategy for cross-boundary goods traffic, i.e. cross-boundary goods vehicles will have to use the Liantang/Heung Yuen Wai Control Point in the east and the Shenzhen Bay Port in the west, while other land boundary control points will mainly handle passenger traffic. The redeveloped STK Control Point will also implement the collaborative inspection and joint clearance mode to enhance passenger clearance experience and efficiency.

  The engineering feasibility study for the STK Control Point redevelopment project is being undertaken by a consultancy firm engaged by the HKSAR Government and is expected to be completed within 2025. The scope of the study includes such matters as area of land involved for the redevelopment of STK Control Point, road infrastructure, traffic impact assessment, environmental assessment and heritage conservation.

  We understand Shenzhen side is in parallel actively preparing the design tendering and the related feasibility study for the STK Port redevelopment project. The HKSAR Government will continue to closely collaborate with the Shenzhen Municipal Government to actively take forward the redevelopment project.

(3) The Luk Keng Road contains many turns and is narrow. Owing to site constraints and traffic safety considerations, the Luk Keng Road is currently designated as a prohibited zone for vehicles with gross weight over 5.5 tonnes, buses, tourist coaches and public light buses (except for scheduled services). Notwithstanding the above, in view of travel needs associated with tourism development in the area, the TD may issue Prohibited Zone Permits, subject to traffic conditions, allowing tourist coaches with 29 seats or less to travel along Luk Keng Road during off-peak hours, with a view to meeting the needs of general visitors and tour groups. To facilitate the tourism industry to understand the traffic arrangements on Luk Keng Road, the TD has disseminated relevant information, including the application procedures of Prohibited Zone Permits, to the industry via the website of Travel Industry Council of Hong Kong.

  According to the TD's assessment, currently the capacity of Luk Keng Road is sufficient to meet the overall traffic demand, including the demand from vehicles to apply for Prohibited Zone Permits. The TD will continue to closely monitor the traffic conditions in the nearby area and make appropriate arrangements.

(4) The Sai Kung Man Yee Road leading to the High Island Reservoir East Dam is a maintenance access road managed by the Water Supplies Department (WSD), primarily used for daily operations and maintenance by the WSD and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). Most sections of the road are single-lane with two-way traffic, which is not fit for access by a large number of vehicles. Currently, members of the public and visitors can access the East Dam by taxis, the Green Minibus Route No. 9A, or tourist coaches that have obtained prior permission from the AFCD.

  At present, the number of tourist coaches permitted to access East Dam on weekends or public holidays is subject to a quota of three coaches per day for application by licensed travel agencies and school groups. From February to August 2025, the WSD and the AFCD received a total of 14 quota applications. Except for two applications that have been rejected due to the applicants' failure to provide necessary information, all other applications were approved in full, showing that the relevant quota has not been fully utilised yet.

  To ensure sustainable development of green tourism and high-quality visitor experience in country parks, the Government is exploring various feasible measures to enhance the management of Sai Kung East Country Park and traffic arrangements for High Island Reservoir East Dam. The Government will review the quota for tourist coaches for access to East Dam having regard to the utilisation rate of such permits.

(5) Since its official commissioning on March 1 this year, Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) has quickly become a new hub for mega sports and entertainment events. Over the past six months, various arrangements including admission of spectators, crowd dispersal and transportation. have been well-received by members of the public and visitors. The Kai Tak Sports Park Limited (the Operator) has all along been in close collaboration with the Government (including the CSTB, the TD, and the Hong Kong Police Force) and public transport operators. They encourage spectators traveling to the park to use public transport as much as possible and avoid driving or taking private cars. At the same time, they continuously optimise the transport arrangements, such as the recent launch of the pre-booking services for some of the parking spaces at the Kai Tak Stadium (KTS) and the Kai Tak Arena as well as the new designated drop-off point for private car users at the Kai Tak Youth Sports Ground.

  There are approximately 80 coach parking spaces and pick-up /drop-off points in total at the KTS. The Operator has continued fine-tuning their arrangements since the opening of the KTSP. At present, the Operator has allocated them for three types of uses, with the primary use being for pre-arranged cross-boundary coaches. Besides, the Operator will facilitate the travel products for individual events offered by event organisers, ticketing platforms and the hotel industry by arranging pre-registered coach services to pick up passengers (for both cross-boundary and non-cross boundary passengers). Thirdly, the Operator will also collaborate closely with the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel Owners to provide coach parking spaces for shuttle buses connecting hotels and the KTS before major events, allowing passengers to drop off at KTS upon prior registration to meet the needs of hotel guests. The above arrangements have been running smoothly and in an orderly manner. Relevant Government departments will continue to work with the Operator to review the operation of the above arrangements and explore the possibility of expanding the scope to cover other non-franchised bus services to further enhance visitors' experience provided that there will be no adverse impact on event arrangements and the traffic in the vicinity."
立法會十九題：攜帶海味乾貨和燕窩產品進入內地,2025-09-25 12:20,2025-09-25 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500576.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上邵家輝議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

內地農業農村部和海關總署於二○二一年修訂《中華人民共和國禁止攜帶、寄遞進境的動植物及其產品和其他檢疫物名錄》（《名錄》），當中乾製的水生動物產品不在《名錄》的禁止清單內。此外，根據《中華人民共和國限制進出境物品表》（署令第43號），海鮮乾貨如涉及瀕危和珍貴動物，均為限制進境物品，而旅客攜運行李物品進出境，應當以自用合理數量為限。可是，有本港業界人士反映，旅客攜帶海味乾貨過關到內地依然困難，而且燕窩貨品仍被禁止攜帶進入內地，因而減低訪港內地旅客購買有關貨品的意欲。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，現時過關旅客攜帶海味乾貨和燕窩貨品入境內地的實際情況為何，包括如何實施《名錄》規定，以及「自用合理數量」的具體定義；如知悉，詳情為何；如不知悉，特區政府會否向內地相關部門作詳細了解；

（二）過去五年，特區政府有否與內地當局就本港海味乾貨和燕窩貨品可獲豁免攜帶過關的安排進行磋商；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）特區政府會否與內地當局進一步磋商，包括放寬旅客攜帶海味乾貨入境的數量，以及容許旅客可攜帶經本港出售並已檢疫的燕窩貨品入境內地的方案；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

本港法例是按照《瀕危野生動植物種國際貿易公約》（《公約》）來管制動物製產品的出口。而不論是否受《公約》管制的動物製產品，政府均會提供衞生證書簽發服務，協助本地出口商符合進口國家／地方的檢疫衞生要求。

就邵家輝議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）根據內地當局於二○二一年修訂的《中華人民共和國禁止攜帶、寄遞進境的動植物及其產品和其他檢疫物名錄》（《名錄》），內地禁止攜帶或郵寄一系列動植物及其產品和其他檢疫物品入境。當中，燕窩（除經商業無菌處理的罐裝燕窩外）和水生動物產品仍被列於《名錄》內，並禁止以攜帶或郵寄方式進境內地。不涉及瀕危物種的乾製水生動物產品則不在禁止《名錄》內。現時旅客攜帶此類乾製水生動物產品往內地亦無須向政府申請許可證或衞生證書。至於個人旅客攜帶物品的限制，包括何謂「自用合理數量」，屬內地當局的事權和執法人員的判斷。

（二）及（三）就燕窩產品方面，政府和內地當局早年已經簽訂關於旅客購自香港的燕窩產品進入內地聯合檢疫管理方案。漁農自然護理署亦一直積極配合和協助燕窩業界，包括向內地當局推薦符合相關註冊要求的生產企業；以及聯同業界與內地當局舉行會議商討優化執行細節等。

政府會繼續協助本地業界出口動物製產品，並提供相關衞生證書簽發服務。至於就個人旅客攜帶物品的限制，我們亦須尊重不同地區進出口的管制和規範。政府在未來會繼續與內地當局和業界保持聯繫，積極反映業界的訴求和意見。"
LCQ19: Carrying dried seafood and bird's nest products into Mainland,2025-09-25 12:20,2025-09-25 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500581.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

In 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and the General Administration of Customs of the Mainland revised the ""Catalog of Animals and Plants, Animal and Plant Products, and Other Quarantine Objects Prohibited from Being Carried, Mailed, or Delivered into the People's Republic of China"" (the Catalog), and dried aquatic animal products are not included in the prohibited list of the Catalog. Moreover, according to the ""List of the People's Republic of China of Articles Restricted from Import and Export"" (Customs Notice No. 43), dried seafood involving endangered and precious animals are articles restricted from import, and such articles carried by visitors in their luggage for import and export should be limited to reasonable quantities for personal use. However, some members of the industry in Hong Kong have relayed that Mainland visitors still encounter difficulties in carrying dried seafood for custom clearance, and bird's nest products remain prohibited from being carried into the Mainland, dampening the desire of Mainland visitors to Hong Kong to purchase such products. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows the actual situation of visitors crossing the boundary carrying dried seafood and bird's nest products into the Mainland at present, including how the provisions of the Catalog are implemented and the specific definition of ""reasonable quantities for personal use""; if so, of the details; if not, whether the SAR Government will gain a detailed understanding from the relevant Mainland authorities;

(2) whether, in the past five years, the SAR Government has discussed with the Mainland authorities the arrangements for exempting Hong Kong dried seafood and bird's nest products from customs clearance; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether the SAR Government will further discuss with the Mainland authorities, including relaxing the quantity of dried seafood that visitors are allowed to carry into the Mainland and the proposal to allow visitors to carry quarantine bird's nest products sold in Hong Kong into the Mainland; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

Hong Kong legislation regulates the export of animal products in accordance with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). For animal products (whether regulated under CITES), the Government provides sanitary certification services to assist local exporters in meeting the quarantine and sanitary requirements of importing countries/places.

The reply to the question from the Hon Shiu Ka-fai is as follows:

(1) According to the ""Catalogue of Animals and Plants, Animal and Plant Products and other Quarantine Objects Prohibited from being Carried or Mailed into the People's Republic of China"" (the Catalogue) revised by the Mainland authorities in 2021, the Mainland prohibits the carrying or mailing of a range of animals, plants, and their products, as well as other quarantine objects into the Mainland. Among others, bird's nest (except commercially sterilised canned bird's nest products) and aquatic animal products are still listed in the Catalogue and cannot be carried or mailed into the Mainland. Dried aquatic animal products not involving endangered species are not under the prohibited Catalogue. At present, passengers carrying such dried aquatic animal products to the Mainland do not need to apply for permits or sanitary/health certificates from the HKSAR Government. As regards the restriction on personal items that individual travellers can carry, including the definition of ""reasonable quantity for personal use"", falls under the jurisdiction of the Mainland authorities and the judgment of law enforcement officers.

(2) & (3) Regarding bird's nest products, the HKSAR Government and the Mainland authorities in earlier years signed a joint quarantine management plan for bird's nest products purchased by travellers in Hong Kong and brought into the Mainland. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has been actively collaborating and assisting the trade by recommending manufacturers that meet the relevant registration requirements to the Mainland authorities, and holding meetings with the trade and the Mainland authorities to discuss optimising the implementation details.

The HKSAR Government will continue to assist the local trade in exporting animal products through our services in issuing relevant sanitary/health certificates. As regards restrictions on personal items carried by individual travellers, we need to respect the import and export control and regulations of different regions. The HKSAR Government will continue to maintain communication with the Mainland authorities and the trade, and actively convey the trade's demands and views."

Special traffic and transport arrangements for Kai Tak Stadium concerts on September 27 and 28,2025-09-25 12:15,2025-09-25 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500561.htm," The Transport Department (TD) today (September 25) said that special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to facilitate the holding of concerts at Kai Tak Stadium on the evenings of September 27 and 28. As traffic in the vicinity of the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

 The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the frequency of trains on the Tuen Ma Line. The last MTR train to Lo Wu Station via interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line will depart from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm. Franchised bus companies will provide 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (route No. SP12), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and Airport (route No. A25S), and major districts across the territory.

 Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day may also take the KTSP's cross-boundary coach services during dispersal. Passengers should purchase tickets from the operators' online platforms in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal.

 The Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (2pm to 6.30pm) and suspended for taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid the outflux of spectators, and passengers' patience is appreciated.

 Spectators are advised to heed real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application and radio and television broadcasts."
財經事務及庫務局局長結束訪問斯洛文尼亞後轉往波蘭（附圖）,2025-09-25 12:03,2025-09-25 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500393.htm,"財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇九月二十四日上午（盧布爾雅那時間）與斯洛文尼亞副總理兼財政部長Klemen Boštjančič再次會面，隨後前往波蘭繼續其歐洲訪問行程。許正宇會面時表示此次訪問成果豐碩，尤其是欣悉斯洛文尼亞政府和國會正討論優先處理與香港磋商全面性避免雙重課稅協定（全面性協定）的事宜。

「香港特別行政區政府與斯洛文尼亞政府均積極尋求早日簽訂全面性協定，減少不必要的稅務障礙，以鼓勵雙邊貿易和投資。簽署全面性協定有助香港和斯洛文尼亞建立更緊密的經濟聯繫，我相信兩地商界會對此表示歡迎。」

他補充說：「香港和斯洛文尼亞有着不少共通之處，兩地面積雖小，但同樣目光遠大，佔有重要的經濟和戰略地位。此外，兩地均擁有多元化的經濟體系，奉行開放和高效政策並具備穩定的投資環境，讓我們成為彼此的理想門戶，助力歐洲企業通過香港進入亞洲和中國巿場，與此同時，中國企業亦可由此走進歐洲巿場。」

許正宇特別向Klemen Boštjančič提到，香港正鞏固其作為國際資產和財富管理中心的地位。香港管理的資產總值在二○二四年年底達到3.81萬億歐元，按年增加13%。乘着私人銀行和私人財富管理領域亮麗的表現，行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》宣布更多便利措施，包括豐富「新資本投資者入境計劃」下的投資選項，優化基金、單一家族辦公室和附帶權益的優惠稅制，以及擴大內地與香港資本市場的互聯互通，以加大香港對家族辦公室和全球高資產淨值人士的吸引力。

他其後亦與斯洛文尼亞主管稅務、關稅及其他費用及提升公共支出效能的部長Katja Božič會面，討論日後啓動全面性協定磋商的後續工作。

SFST proceeds to Poland after concluding visit to Slovenia (with photos),2025-09-25 12:03,2025-09-25 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500394.htm,"  The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Slovenia, Mr Klemen BoštjanÄiÄ, again in the morning of September 24 (Ljubljana time) before proceeding to Poland for the second leg of his European visit. He said at the meeting that the visit was very fruitful, especially regarding the news that the Slovenian Government and National Assembly are deliberating on the decision to prioritise the Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreement (CDTA) negotiations with Hong Kong.

  ""Both the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Slovenian governments are keen to pursue a CDTA early to reduce unnecessary tax obstacles for encouraging bilateral trade and investment. The signing of the CDTA will foster closer economic ties between Hong Kong and Slovenia, and I believe that it will be welcomed by the business communities in both places.

  ""Hong Kong and Slovenia have a lot in common, both being small yet significant economically and strategically with big ambitions. We both offer a diverse economy with a stable investment environment, underpinned by openness and efficiency. That makes us each perfect gateways for each other, enabling European enterprises to enter Asian and Mainland markets through Hong Kong, and Slovenia a place through which Mainland companies can access Europe,"" he added.

  Mr Hui also highlighted to Mr BoštjanÄiÄ that Hong Kong is consolidating its status as an international asset and wealth management centre. The total assets under management in Hong Kong grew by 13 per cent year on year, reaching EUR3.81 trillion by the end of 2024. Riding on the particularly stellar performance in the private banking and private wealth management sector, more facilitation measures have been announced by the Chief Executive in his 2025 Policy Address to make Hong Kong even more attractive to family offices and global high-net-worth individuals. These measures include enriching the investment options under the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme, enhancing the preferential tax regimes for funds, single family offices and carried interest, as well as expanding the mutual access between capital markets of the Mainland and Hong Kong.

  He also met with the State Secretary responsible for Taxes, Customs Duties and Other Charges and for Improving the Efficiency of Public Spending of Slovenia, Ms Katja BoÅ¾iÄ, to discuss the next steps in the process of commencing the negotiations on the CDTA.

  In the afternoon, Mr Hui started his itinerary in Warsaw, Poland, where he visited Lenovo Technology and met with its General Manager at Lenovo Poland, Mr Wojciech Zaskorski, and other senior members of the company to learn more about the macroeconomic situation and digitalisation of Poland, as well as the needs of Mainland companies in their expansion overseas.

  Mr Hui stated that Hong Kong is striving to be the perfect platform to support Mainland companies going global. A Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global will be set up to encourage Mainland enterprises to utilise Hong Kong in expanding their businesses overseas. Hong Kong will facilitate the establishment in the city of more corporate treasury centres by Mainland companies and regional headquarters by the banking sector, particularly by Mainland banks. Hong Kong will also promote the development of carbon audit services to assist enterprises going global to meet international requirements and standards on green trade in respect of carbon emission reduction.

  He reiterated that Hong Kong has an extensive pool of professionals to serve Mainland companies on their journey towards global market expansion. Using the accounting sector as an example, he said that the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has compiled the List of accounting firms helping Mainland enterprises go global to help Mainland companies to tackle thechallenges of venturing abroad. As at mid-August, the list includes 83 Hong Kong accounting firms.

  Mr Hui will visit the Warsaw Stock Exchange on September 25 (Warsaw time) and meet with Polish government officials and members of the business sector."
Fifth cohort of School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme opens for applications in October,2025-09-25 12:00,2025-09-25 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500500.htm,"  The Education Bureau (EDB) today (September 25) announced that the fifth cohort of the School Nominations Direct Admission Scheme (SNDAS) will be open for applications by local Secondary Six students who will be taking the 2026 Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination and commencing their undergraduate studies in September 2026.

A spokesman for the EDB said, ""Launched in the 2022/23 academic year, the SNDAS is a scheme that recognises the exceptional talents of students in specific disciplines that may not be fully assessed by the HKDSE Examination by allowing students with special and diversified talents to be matched with programmes that suit their potential. It provides opportunities for these students to be considered for direct admission to local universities.""

The nomination period for the fifth cohort of the SNDAS will run from October 9 to December 3, 2025. Students who intend to apply for their preferred programmes through the SNDAS must be nominated by their secondary schools. Each local secondary school can nominate two students with exceptional talents and interests in specific disciplines/areas, and each student nominee can apply for admission to one designated University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded undergraduate programme participating in the SNDAS.

Participating universities will arrange interviews for all students nominated for the SNDAS and make firm offers to successful students prior to the release of the 2026 HKDSE Examination results.

The eight UGC-funded universities have designated over 300 publicly funded undergraduate programmes to participate in the fifth cohort of the SNDAS and set admission criteria that are not based on HKDSE Examination results for individual programmes. Details of the SNDAS and specific admission requirements of the participating programmes have been uploaded to the scheme's website (www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/postsecondary/policy-doc/SNDAS/index.html).

The EDB adds that the SNDAS was introduced to provide an additional pathway to university for students with exceptional talents. Those nominated for the SNDAS, like other Secondary Six students, are required to apply for admission to universities through the Joint University Programmes Admissions System in parallel and to sit for the HKDSE Examinations, ensuring they do not limit their opportunities for further studies.

  To promote a culture of multifaceted excellence, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau launched the Multi-talent Development Scholarship (MDS) in the 2025/26 academic year, funded by the Board of Management of the Chinese Permanent Cemeteries, for admittees of the SNDAS demonstrating outstanding achievements in arts, sports and/or community service on top of the firm offers made under the SNDAS. Among the students being formally admitted to their respective universities under the SNDAS, each of the eight UGC-funded universities will be invited to nominate SNDAS admittees demonstrating outstanding performance in arts, sports and/or community service for the award of the scholarships in addition to the firm offers made. The quotas of scholarship nominations will be distributed proportionally, having regard to the number of students admitted to each university by the SNDAS. Each awardee, not subject to means testing, will be granted a scholarship of $10,000 per year across his/her four-year tuition period. The universities shall enjoy the autonomy to select and nominate awardees for the MDS.

The EDB set up the Task Force on Review of School Curriculum in November 2017 to holistically review the primary and secondary curricula. The review report submitted by the Task Force to the EDB in September 2020 put forward six directional recommendations, including the implementation of a new direct admission scheme to enhance flexibility in university admissions. The EDB accepted the recommendation and introduced the SNDAS starting with the 2022/23 academic year."
​第五屆學校推薦直接錄取計劃十月接受報名,2025-09-25 12:00,2025-09-25 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500493.htm,"教育局今日（九月二十五日）宣布，第五屆學校推薦直接錄取計劃（直接錄取計劃）將開放予將應考二○二六年香港中學文憑考試（文憑試），並於同年九月升讀學士學位課程的本地中六學生報名參加。

教育局發言人說：「直接錄取計劃自二○二二／二三學年起推行，旨在認同一些在特定範疇具有過人才能，而有關才能未必能透過文憑試獲全面評核的學生。計劃讓具特殊或多元才華的學生與切合他們潛能的課程互相配對，提供機會讓本港大學考慮直接錄取。」

第五屆直接錄取計劃的提名期為二○二五年十月九日至十二月三日，有意透過計劃報讀心儀學科的學生須獲其就讀中學推薦。每間本地中學可推薦兩名在個別學科／範疇具有特殊才華及興趣的學生參與計劃。每名獲推薦的學生可報讀一個參與計劃的指定大學教育資助委員會（教資會）資助學士學位課程。

參與直接錄取計劃的大學將會為所有獲推薦的學生安排面試，並於二○二六年文憑試成績公布前，向成功申請的學生發出「直接錄取」通知。

八所教資會資助大學已指定超過300個公帑資助學士學位課程參與第五屆直接錄取計劃，並為個別課程訂下不以文憑試成績為基礎的收生準則。有關直接錄取計劃的詳情及個別參與課程的具體入讀要求，已上載至計劃網頁（www.edb.gov.hk/tc/edu-system/postsecondary/policy-doc/SNDAS/index.html）。

教育局補充，直接錄取計劃旨在為具有特定過人才能的學生提供多一個升讀大學的途徑。獲推薦參與直接錄取計劃的學生須與一般中六學生一樣，同時循一般途徑透過大學聯合招生辦法報讀大學課程，並如期赴考文憑試，以免限制升學機會。

 為提倡多元卓越文化，民政及青年事務局由二○二五／二六學年起推行多元發展獎學金，由華人永遠墳場管理委員會贊助，獎勵於直接錄取計劃下獲大學錄取且在藝術、體育及╱或社會服務方面表現傑出的學生。八所教資會資助大學除了對各自經直接錄取計劃正式錄取的學生發出「直接錄取」通知外，亦可提名當中在藝術、體育及／或社會服務方面表現超卓者獲取獎學金。提名名額將根據各大學於直接錄取計劃下的收生人數按比例分配。每名獲獎者可無須通過經濟狀況審查而在四年修業期內每年獲發放10,000元獎學金。大學可自行甄選並提名獎學金計劃的獲獎者。

教育局於二○一七年十一月成立學校課程檢討專責小組，整體檢視中小學課程。專責小組於二○二○年九月向教育局提交的檢討報告中提出六個方向性建議，當中包括推行全新的直接錄取計劃，以提高大學收生靈活度。教育局接納了專責小組的建議，並由二○二二／二三學年起推行直接錄取計劃。"

Good morning.It is my pleasure to join you today at the very firstHong KongFixed Income and Currency Forum. While the inclement weather has brought us together in a virtual setting, I am confident that the quality of discussionsandexchangeof ideaswill be no less engaging. This conference promises to be both inspiring and productive.

A Strong Foundationamid Global Shifts

Hostingthis forumin HongKongis very timely.This year, Hong Kong has once again captured the attention of globalinvestors. In a world marked bygeopoliticaltensions and rising unilateralism, international investors are increasingly seeking to diversify their asset allocations. At the same time, Chinesetechenterpriseslike Deep Seekhave inspired renewed optimism about theregion'stechnological prowessandinvestment prospects. Capital is flowinginbecauseHong Kong isbothasafe heaven and a market offering superior returns.Our stock marketisreflectingthis momentum.

Yet, what is often less highlighted is our fixed income and currency (FIC) market, which also offerscompelling prospects. In fact,the Asianinternational bond market has been flourishing inrecent years, with issuance volumes growingon averageat 16 per cent per annumover the past 15 years. This far outpaces the global average of less than 4 per cent.

Hong Kong is a leaderinthisspace.Last year, international bond issuance here exceeded US$130 billion.In fact,in 9 out ofthe past10 years, Hong Kong toppedAsiaandcapturednearly 30%ofthe regionalmarket.Even more impressively, 45% of the region's green and sustainable bondswere arranged by us.

It helps that Hong Kong is the world's largest offshore RMB hub.We processedover RMB 3 trillioninpaymentsdailyin 2024, andmaintain the deepest RMB liquidity pool outside the Chinese Mainland. Thisis becoming a key pillarof Hong Kong's vibrant foreign exchange market, which now ranks fourth globally.

As RMB gains traction as a trade,investment andreserve currency, global investors are seeking more investmentproductsand risk managementtoolsdenominated in RMB. Hong Kong isactively seizing these opportunities.

With the strong support from the Central Authorities, Hong Kong has become the offshorecentrefor RMB sovereign bonds. The Ministry of Finance has issued RMB sovereign bonds in Hong Kong for 17 years in a row, with cumulativevalue exceeding RMB 410 billion. Moreover,Mainlandprovinces and municipalities, such as Hainan,Guangdongand Shenzhen, have also issued bonds here to support their sustainable development. The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is also increasing theissuanceof RMB-denominated bonds, which account for more than 20% of all bondsthatwe have issued thus far.

The dim sum bond marketin Hong Kongis also thriving, reachingRMB 1 trillion last year, doublingthatof2021.In addition, the diversity of issuers is expanding. A notable example is the RMB 2 billion3-year bondissuedby the Development Bank of Kazakhstanearlier this month. It is the first of its kind by a government in Central Asia.

These encouraging developments areenriching Hong Kong’s fixed income ecosystem, including the growth of products like fixed income ETFs, the product suiteof whichisalsoexpanding, providing exposure to US Treasuries, Chinese government bonds, Asian bonds,green bonds, and more.

Above all, Hong Kong'sFICmarketoffers a uniquevalue preposition. Under the""one country, two systems"" framework, we uphold the free flow of capital and information.Our currencyispegged to the US dollarwith a relatively stable exchange rate, and itis freely convertible.At the same time,we have establishedmutual market access arrangements with the Chinese Mainland. Together, these strengthsgiveglobal issuers and investorsaccess to deep liquidity in an efficient, familiar and trusted environment.

Breaking New Groundin a Changing Landscape

Looking ahead, Hong Kong is committed to building an even more vibrant FIC ecosystem,one that creates lastingvalue and new opportunities for international issuers and investors.Tothis end, we are driving forwardon threefronts.

First,we areenhancing market infrastructure. This includes strengthening the platforms for custody, management and trading of FIC products, while deepening our connectivity with global financial partners.

As announced in the Policy Address last week, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will collaborate to explorecentralisedasset management and cross-collateralisationof assets on a single platform. Our goal is to develop a globally competitive, multi-asset class custodial infrastructure, presenting investors with the opportunity to better manage their assets andoptimisetheir value. For example, such assets could becollateralisedto provide liquidity and enable derivative products to be developed. This arrangementwill bemadeavailable also to assets under the various mutual market access schemes.

In parallel, theSecurities and Futures Commissionisexploring the feasibility ofcreating anelectronic bond trading platformto bebuilt and operated by market participants. It is aimed at broadeningparticipation andenhancingmarketefficiency, transparency and resilience.

On the international front, we are actively seeking cross-border collaboration on debt securities depository and settlementwith more global partners, including the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Switzerland.

Second,we arestrengthening market liquidity and expanding productofferings. We are committed to broadening theFIC productissuer base and encouraging more corporates to raisefundsthroughHong Kong's bond market.

Oneexampleisthe establishmentofacommercial repo market and a central counterparty regime, both of which willenhancesecondary market liquidity.We are also working to expand the use of offshore Chinese Government bonds as collateral across different clearing houses. In this connection, the HKMA and the SFC will jointly promote the development of a market-based CNH yield curve, particularly at the long end.

The offshore RMB market continues to present significant potential. We are activelyproviding liquidity support,exploringmore use cases of RMB and encouraging the development of RMB-denominated investment and risk management products. As part ofsuchefforts,the HKMA is providingbanks in Hong Kong witha trade finance liquidity facilityofRMB 100 billion.We willalsocontinue toexpand anddeepen mutual market access schemes with theMainland. This willfurther enrich the product offerings available to both Mainland and international investors.

Third, embracingfinancialinnovation.Tokenisationof real-world assets, including bonds and other financial instruments, isopening up exciting new frontiers in the FIC market.

We are leading by example. Over the past two years, the Government has issued two pioneering tranches oftokenisedgreen bonds, making us the first government in the world to do so. Preparation for a third tranche isalreadyunder wayandwe plan toregularisethis.

Another example, of course, istheHKMA's Project Ensemble, which provides a sandbox to test thetokenisationof traditional financial products, including money market funds and others. The SFC hasalsobeen working with the HKMA to promote the wider adoption oftokenisationin the asset management industry.

On the private market side, the SFCauthorisedAsia's first batch of threetokenisedretail money market funds earlier this year.As of June this year, these three funds reached a combined AUM of US$350 million,with a74% quarter-on-quarter growth.In July, two moretokenisedretail money market funds were approved, further demonstrating the market's growing appetite forsuch products.

The Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap

Ladies and gentlemen, later today, the SFC and the HKMA will jointly release the Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap, which outlines10initiatives across four focus areas: boosting primary market issuance, enhancing secondary market liquidity, expanding offshore RMB business, and building next-generation market infrastructure.

This roadmaprepresents a shared commitmentbetween the public and private sectors to reinforce Hong Kong's role as a premier FIC hub, ensuring that our markets remain competitive, inclusive, and globally connected.

A Call to Collaboration

The journey to building a world-class, globally competitive FIC market cannot be undertaken by any one party alone. While the Government and regulators can lay the foundation, it is the market—issuers, investors, and intermediaries—that must bring it to life.

So today, I invite all of you to join us on this journey. Let us work together to unlock the full potential of Hong Kong's FICmarkets, and to shape the future of finance in the region and beyond.

Thank you once again for joining us at this inaugural FIC Forum. I wish you all a productive, insightful, and rewarding event, and the best of business and health in the time ahead."

Above all, Hong Kong'sFICmarketoffers a uniquevalue preposition. Under the""one country, two systems"" framework, we uphold the free flow of capital and information.Our currencyispegged to the US dollarwith a relatively stable exchange rate, and itis freely convertible.At the same time,we have establishedmutual market access arrangements with the Chinese Mainland. Together, these strengthsgiveglobal issuers and investorsaccess to deep liquidity in an efficient, familiar and trusted environment.

Breaking New Groundin a Changing Landscape

Looking ahead, Hong Kong is committed to building an even more vibrant FIC ecosystem,one that creates lastingvalue and new opportunities for international issuers and investors.Tothis end, we are driving forwardon threefronts.

First,we areenhancing market infrastructure. This includes strengthening the platforms for custody, management and trading of FIC products, while deepening our connectivity with global financial partners.

As announced in the Policy Address last week, the HKMA and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will collaborate to explorecentralisedasset management and cross-collateralisationof assets on a single platform. Our goal is to develop a globally competitive, multi-asset class custodial infrastructure, presenting investors with the opportunity to better manage their assets andoptimisetheir value. For example, such assets could becollateralisedto provide liquidity and enable derivative products to be developed. This arrangementwill bemadeavailable also to assets under the various mutual market access schemes.

In parallel, theSecurities and Futures Commissionisexploring the feasibility ofcreating anelectronic bond trading platformto bebuilt and operated by market participants. It is aimed at broadeningparticipation andenhancingmarketefficiency, transparency and resilience.

On the international front, we are actively seeking cross-border collaboration on debt securities depository and settlementwith more global partners, including the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and Switzerland.

Second,we arestrengthening market liquidity and expanding productofferings. We are committed to broadening theFIC productissuer base and encouraging more corporates to raisefundsthroughHong Kong's bond market.

Oneexampleisthe establishmentofacommercial repo market and a central counterparty regime, both of which willenhancesecondary market liquidity.We are also working to expand the use of offshore Chinese Government bonds as collateral across different clearing houses. In this connection, the HKMA and the SFC will jointly promote the development of a market-based CNH yield curve, particularly at the long end.

The offshore RMB market continues to present significant potential. We are activelyproviding liquidity support,exploringmore use cases of RMB and encouraging the development of RMB-denominated investment and risk management products. As part ofsuchefforts,the HKMA is providingbanks in Hong Kong witha trade finance liquidity facilityofRMB 100 billion.We willalsocontinue toexpand anddeepen mutual market access schemes with theMainland. This willfurther enrich the product offerings available to both Mainland and international investors.

Third, embracingfinancialinnovation.Tokenisationof real-world assets, including bonds and other financial instruments, isopening up exciting new frontiers in the FIC market.

We are leading by example. Over the past two years, the Government has issued two pioneering tranches oftokenisedgreen bonds, making us the first government in the world to do so. Preparation for a third tranche isalreadyunder wayandwe plan toregularisethis.

Another example, of course, istheHKMA's Project Ensemble, which provides a sandbox to test thetokenisationof traditional financial products, including money market funds and others. The SFC hasalsobeen working with the HKMA to promote the wider adoption oftokenisationin the asset management industry.

On the private market side, the SFCauthorisedAsia's first batch of threetokenisedretail money market funds earlier this year.As of June this year, these three funds reached a combined AUM of US$350 million,with a74% quarter-on-quarter growth.In July, two moretokenisedretail money market funds were approved, further demonstrating the market's growing appetite forsuch products.

The Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap

Ladies and gentlemen, later today, the SFC and the HKMA will jointly release the Fixed Income and Currency Roadmap, which outlines10initiatives across four focus areas: boosting primary market issuance, enhancing secondary market liquidity, expanding offshore RMB business, and building next-generation market infrastructure.

This roadmaprepresents a shared commitmentbetween the public and private sectors to reinforce Hong Kong's role as a premier FIC hub, ensuring that our markets remain competitive, inclusive, and globally connected.

A Call to Collaboration

The journey to building a world-class, globally competitive FIC market cannot be undertaken by any one party alone. While the Government and regulators can lay the foundation, it is the market—issuers, investors, and intermediaries—that must bring it to life.

So today, I invite all of you to join us on this journey. Let us work together to unlock the full potential of Hong Kong's FICmarkets, and to shape the future of finance in the region and beyond.

Thank you once again for joining us at this inaugural FIC Forum. I wish you all a productive, insightful, and rewarding event, and the best of business and health in the time ahead."

答覆：

主席：

就邱達根議員的提問，經諮詢相關決策局後，我現回覆如下。

（一）及（二）香港積極建設蓬勃的人工智能（AI）生態，在過去數年進行了周密布局及落實全方位措施。

繼去年提出「人工智能+」行動，國家在今年八月發布《關於深入實施「人工智能+」行動的意見》（《意見》），推動與經濟社會各行業及領域的深度融合。

為了推進本港AI+發展，二○二五年《施政報告》大力拓展AI應用，賦能產業，同時鞏固香港在AI科研、人才、資金、數據等方面的優勢。譬如在科研方面，我們正爭取立法會撥款10億元，於二○二六年成立「香港人工智能研發院」，促進AI上游研發、中下游成果轉化及開拓應用場景。為數30億元的「前沿科技研究支援計劃」亦即將推出，支持本地資助院校吸引AI等方面的國際科研頂尖人物來港。

在資金方面，我們將啓動「創科產業引導基金」，積極引導市場投資包括AI在內的策略性新興和未來產業；而港投公司（香港投資管理有限公司）作為政府全資擁有的「耐心資本」機構，亦會繼續投資AI企業，支持AI產業發展。

至於算力設施，數碼港人工智能超算中心將提升算力，而30億元人工智能資助計劃亦已批出十多個項目，推動科研和大規模AI應用。我們亦會於短期內推出北區沙嶺約10公頃數據園區發展用地作市場招標，提供先進算力設施，推動AI相關產業發展。

在人才培訓方面，政府在「優質教育基金」下預留20億元支援中小學數字教育，並會制定數字教育藍圖，包括訂定「AI素養」學習架構。政府亦會聯同專業團體推行AI教育先導計劃，加強教師AI培訓，並陸續推出「電子學習配套計劃」，向學校提供包括AI的數字平台及工具。

AI應用是推動「AI+」行動的重中之重。除了在公務及不同界別開拓更多AI應用場景外，我們亦會優化「數碼轉型支援先導計劃」，資助中小企應用AI方案，促進「AI產業化、產業AI化」。

（三）AI發展須以安全為舵，以應用為帆。數據作為AI技術的核心要素，其安全、開放和共享是「AI+」發展的先決條件。

我們的政策目標是促進數據「管」、「用」有機結合，平衡數據為本的AI發展的需要和風險。數字政策辦公室已發布《人工智能道德框架》、《數據治理原則》，以及《香港生成式人工智能技術及應用指引》，為開發、設計、處理及安全使用AI服務提供指引及建議，並提倡數據流通及安全應用。

針對跨境數據，我們在《促進粵港澳大灣區數據跨境流動的合作備忘錄》的基礎上推出了「標準合同」便利措施，促進數據安全有序跨境流動。我們也會積極探討內地數據合規安全流動到河套香港園區用於科研，助力AI創新。

因應AI的發展，個人資料私隱專員公署發布了各項指引，提供有關AI管治和保障個人資料私隱的建議。律政司亦將成立跨部門工作小組，檢視更廣泛應用AI所需的法律配套。

政府會繼續留意AI的發展趨勢和香港所需，採取多軌並行的策略，優化本港的數據治理，在確保安全的前提下，充分發揮AI+的發展潛力。"
LCQ2: Alignment with country's efforts in promoting artificial intelligence development,2025-09-25 11:45,2025-09-25 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500554.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Duncan Chiu and a reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  The Opinions on Deeply Implementing the ""AI+"" Initiative (""the Opinions"") issued last month by the State Council proposed accelerating implementation of six key actions and reinforcing eight fundamental support capabilities in order to enable all the people to share in the dividends of artificial intelligence (""AI"") development. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it will study in depth the specific content of the Opinions and the ensuing opportunities and challenges for Hong Kong, and explore how Hong Kong should align and dovetail with the actions proposed in the Opinions, as well as its proposed drive towards reinforcing fundamental support capabilities, including formulation of specific plans and timetables, so as to support the country in achieving the objectives set out in the Opinions;

(2) whether it has reviewed Hong Kong's strategy, as well as its effectiveness, in promoting AI development, including areas requiring enhancement and optimisation in terms of policy support, technological innovation, talent training, capital chain, application scenario, community awareness and so on; and

(3) whether it will formulate comprehensive regulations for data protection and governance, including data security legislation, to ensure the secure and effective access, transmission and use of data, particularly cross-boundary data exchange and flow, and establish an internationally aligned data flow mechanism to realise Hong Kong's goal of becoming an international data hub?

Reply:

President,

Having consulted the relevant bureaux, my reply to the questions raised by the Hon Duncan Chiu is as follows:

(1) & (2) Hong Kong has been taking proactive steps to build a vibrant artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem, having conducted meticulous planning and implemented comprehensive measures over the past few years.

Following the launch of the ""AI Plus"" initiative last year, our motherland issued in August this year the ""Opinions on Deepening the Implementation of the 'AI Plus' Initiative"" (the Opinions), with a view to promoting the close integration of AI with various industries and sectors of the economy and society.

To advance Hong Kong's ""AI Plus"" development, the 2025 Policy Address advocates the broadening of AI applications to empower industries while consolidating Hong Kong's strengths in AI research, talent, funding and data, etc.For example, in terms of research, we are seeking a provision of $1 billion from the Legislative Council for the establishment of the Hong Kong Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Institute (AIRDI) in 2026, which will facilitate upstream AI research and development (R&D), midstream and downstream transformation of R&D outcomes, as well as expansion of use cases. The $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme will also be launched shortly to help local subsidised institutions in attracting top-notch international scientific researchers in areas such as AI to Hong Kong.

In respect of financing, the Government will launch the Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund to proactively channel market capital to invest in emerging and future industries of strategic importance including AI. The Hong Kong Investment Corporation Limited as a wholly government-owned ""patient capital"" institution will continue to invest in AI enterprises to support the development of the AI industry.

As regards computing facilities, Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre will enhance its computing power, and the $3 billion AI Subsidy Scheme has already approved over ten projects to fuel scientific research and large-scale AI applications. We will also put up for tender a site of about 10 hectares at Sandy Ridge in the North District soon for the development of a data facility cluster, providing advanced computing power facilities and promoting the development of AI-related industries.

Regarding talent development, in addition to setting aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund to support digital education for primary and secondary schools, the Government will formulate a Blueprint for Digital Education, including establishing an ""AI literacy"" learning framework. Besides, the Government will collaborate with professional bodies to roll out pilot schemes on AI education and enhance AI-related training for teachers. Digital platforms and tools equipped with AI will also be launched progressively under the e-Learning Ancillary Facilities Programme for schools.

AI application is key in taking forward the ""AI Plus"" initiative. In addition to expanding AI application scenarios in public services and various sectors, we will also enhance the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme to provide small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with subsidies to apply AI solutions, thereby promoting ""industries for AI"" and ""AI for industries"".

(3) The development of AI must be steered by safety and driven by application. As the core element of AI technology, the security, openness and sharing of data are pre-requisites for ""AI Plus"" development.

Our policy objective is to foster proper data management and data usage, balancing the needs and risks of data-driven AI development. The Digital Policy Office has released the Ethical AI Framework, the Principles of Data Governance and the Hong Kong Generative AI Technical and Application Guideline, providing guidance and recommendations for the development, design, processing and secure use of AI services, while advocating data flow and secure application.

Regarding cross-boundary data, we have introduced the ""Standard Contract"" facilitation measure based on the ""Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" to facilitate the safe and orderly cross-boundary flow of data. We will also proactively explore the compliant and secure flow of Mainland data to the Hong Kong Park in the Loop for scientific research purposes, supporting AI application testing and innovation.

In view of the AI development, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has released various guidelines, providing recommendations on AI governance and personal data privacy protection. The Department of Justice will also establish an inter-departmental working group to review the legislation needed to support a wider application of AI.

The Government will continue to monitor AI development trends and the needs of Hong Kong, adopting a multi-pronged strategy to enhance the data governance of Hong Kong, thereby fully unleashing the development potential of ""AI Plus"" on the premise of ensuring safety."

​立法會二十二題：推廣應用學習科目,2025-09-25 11:34,2025-09-25 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500466.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上梁文廣議員的提問和教育局局長蔡若蓮博士的書面答覆︰

問題：

應用學習作為高中課程的選修科目之一，着重實用性和與不同職業領域聯繫的學習元素，是本港中學課程連接及推動職業專才（職專）教育的重要組成部分。有意見認為，隨着國家與特區政府越來越重視職專教育，加上第二所應用科學大學（應科大）已於去年十一月成立，高中的應用學習科目與應科大有更好的結合。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）二○二五年香港中學文憑考試（文憑試）的應用學習科目考試的總報考人數為7 891人，但各科目的考生人數分布極不平均，其中最受歡迎的「甜品及咖啡店營運」考生接近1 000人，惟超過一半科目的考生人數不足100人，其中「電腦鑑證科技」更無人報考，當局有否評估某些科目較受考生歡迎或不受歡迎的原因為何；

（二）自應用學習科目設立至今，當局如何評估該科目的成效；除了其在文憑試中的報考人數外，當局有否制訂其他績效指標；

（三）當局會否考慮重新檢視應用學習科目的成效，例如該科目能否實質提升學生的求職技能，以進一步整合該科目和現有資源，從而提升課程質素；

（四）鑑於有意見認為，應用學習科目在文憑試的評核較甲類高中科目簡單，當局有否考慮應用學習科目的評核採用甲類高中科目的水平參照模式，透過五個等級（即第一至五級，第五級再細分為5*及5**）區分頂尖表現的考生；

（五）據悉本港大學在收生時對應用學習科目的比重較低或不予考慮其文憑試的成績，令該科目被視為考生的次等選擇，甚至被認為是成績較差的考生才會選擇，當局有何方法增加該科目的認受性；

（六）據悉澳洲高中生在高中職專課程中獲得的學分，可直接轉入部分大學課程，以增加學生選擇修讀職專課程的誘因，隨着新應科大的成立，當局會否考慮促進大學與中學的合作，增強應用學習科目與大學課程的銜接；及

（七）當局在應科大聯盟於去年十一月成立後，有何新的政策措施進一步推動應科大課程與行業的深度結合？

答覆：

主席：

就梁文廣議員的提問，教育局回覆如下：

（一）至（三）應用學習是有價值的高中選修科目，屬香港中學文憑考試（文憑試）乙類科目，與高中甲類（學習領域科目）和丙類（其他語言課程）科目相輔相成，豐富學生的科目選擇。應用學習課程理論與實踐並重，與職業和專業領域連繫，有助學生加深認識職業專才教育，為未來升學及就業作好準備。

應用學習由最初30個課程發展至目前近60個課程（課程一覽表見教育局網頁www.edb.gov.hk/apl/courselist2028HKDSE），涵蓋六個學習範疇，包括：
（1）創意學習；
（2）媒體及傳意；
（3）商業、管理及法律；
（4）服務；
（5）應用科學；及
（6）工程及生產。

學生可因應自身興趣、志向和能力，選修合適的課程。由於學生的學習興趣、志向和能力各有不同，不同應用學習課程的修讀人數出現差異實屬正常。

課程規劃方面，教育局秉持專業原則，綜合考慮學生需要、社會發展、資源等因素，而非僅以修讀人數作為規劃依據。教育局開辦多元化的課程，以照顧學生的不同能力、興趣和職業志向。為保證課程質素，教育局設有由課程發展議會應用學習委員會、香港學術及職業資歷評審局和香港考試及評核局（考評局）共同參與的質素保證機制，務求課程設計、教學實施及學習成果均符合既定標準。

教育局持續收集不同數據及持份者意見，以檢視應用學習課程推行成效。文憑試應用學習科目報考人數在過去五年持續上升，由二○二一年3430人大幅增加至二○二五年7891人，整體考生百分比由二○二一年佔6.6%上升至二○二五年佔14.1%（詳見附錄）。約九成考生獲得「達標」或以上成績，而考獲「達標並表現優異」（包括「達標並表現優異（I）」及「達標並表現優異（II）」）的考生百分比介乎26%至32%。此外，學校、學生、家長及課程提供機構等持份者均對應用學習表示非常滿意，認同應用學習對學生的個人成長、共通能力、行業知識和未來發展等均具正面影響。數據顯示，超過九成應用學習畢業生繼續升學，銜接不同課程，約5%投身全職或兼職工作。整體而言，應用學習的修讀人數呈上升趨勢，考生表現平穩，有助探索未來。

教育局會持續檢視及更新應用學習課程，透過與業界和學界緊密溝通，收集持份者意見，定期與課程提供機構交流，從而發展多元化且與時並進的應用學習課程，如在本年度開設與生成式人工智能、低空經濟相關的新課程，豐富學生的科目選擇。

（四）應用學習科目的課時為180小時，學習內容着重實用的學習元素，理論與實踐並重，與職業和專業領域連繫，不設公開考試，評核工作由個別課程提供機構負責。應用學習與甲類科目的課時、學習內容和評估方式不同，兩者不宜直接比較。至於應用學習的評級，教育局現正向持份者收集意見，並與考評局展開討論，探討優化應用學習成績匯報的可行性。

（五）至（七）大學收生一直按院校自主原則進行。個別院校、學系或課程將應用學習科目視為選修科目、給予額外分數或作為額外的輔助資料。以應用科學大學的應用學位課程為例，大部分課程將應用學習科目視為選修科目。教育局會繼續與專上院校溝通，推廣應用學習，以增加院校對應用學習的了解。教育局亦透過不同宣傳方式及渠道，包括舉辦課程展覽、播放電視宣傳短片和應用學習畢業生成功故事短片及舉辦家長講座等（有關資訊亦已上載教育局網頁www.edb.gov.hk/apl/ref-and-resources），加深持份者及公眾對應用學習的認識，藉以提高應用學習的認受性。

事實上，政府一直採用「職學聯通、多元發展」的策略，致力推廣職業專才教育（職專教育），並鼓勵年輕人按自己的能力和興趣選擇升學出路及加入不同行業。當中，為強化職專進階路徑，提升職專教育在學位程度的地位，政府於二○二四年二月公布成為應用科學大學的條件。其後，政府分別在二○二四年三月及十一月公布香港都會大學及聖方濟各大學，分別通過嚴謹程序及評審，成功成爲香港首兩所應用科學大學。政府會繼續推動應用科學大學發展，支持更多有能力並具決心朝應用科學大學方向發展的專上院校作出規劃，並通過在二○二四年十一月正式成立的應用科學大學聯盟，推動專上院校與業界及學界進行聯動推廣，以為不同背景的學生提供多元出路。

此外，職業訓練局（職訓局）在教育局支持下，在二○二三／二四學年起於中學推出創新概念的職專教育文憑（高中課程）先導計劃，讓高中學生在文憑試的框架下，同步修讀職專教育相關課程。先導計劃將職專元素融入文憑試的框架當中，課程內容包括職業英語和職業中文、加入延伸學習時數的相關文憑試甲類選修科、應用學習課程及其他學習經歷。學生在修畢課程後，可同時取得文憑試證書及資歷架構第三級的職專教育文憑，銜接職訓局的相關高級文憑課程，從而完善職專教育升學路徑。二○二五／二六學年的先導計劃涉及「酒店及旅遊」和「資訊科技」兩個學科範疇，共有六間中學約120名學生參與。教育局會繼續支持有關工作。"
LCQ22: Promoting Applied Learning subjects,2025-09-25 11:34,2025-09-25 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500467.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Leung Man-kwong and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 Applied Learning (ApL), as an elective in the senior secondary curriculum, emphasises practicality and focuses on learning elements linked to different vocational fields. It serves as a key component in the interface between local secondary education and vocational and professional education and training (VPET) as well as the promotion of VPET. There are views that, given the increasing emphasis placed on VPET by both our country and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, coupled with the establishment of the second university of applied sciences (UAS) in November last year, there will be better integration between ApL subjects in senior secondary education and UAS. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that, among the 7 891 candidates sitting for ApL subjects in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) 2025, the distribution of candidates across subjects was highly uneven, in which the most popular subject ""Pâtisserie and Café Operations"" attracted nearly 1 000 candidates, while more than half of the subjects recorded fewer than 100 candidates and nobody sat for the subject ""Computer Forensic Technology"", whether the authorities have assessed the reasons for the popularity or unpopularity of certain subjects among candidates;

(2) since the establishment of ApL subjects, how the authorities assess their effectiveness; apart from the number of candidates sitting for these subjects in the HKDSE, whether the authorities have formulated other performance indicators;

(3) whether the authorities will consider reviewing afresh the effectiveness of ApL subjects, such as whether the subjects can bring tangible benefits to students by enhancing their job-seeking skills, in order to further consolidate the subjects as well as the existing resources, and thereby improving the quality of the courses;

(4) as there are views that a relatively simple assessment approach is adopted for ApL subjects in the HKDSE than that of the Category A Senior Secondary subjects, whether the authorities have considered adopting the standard-referenced approach used for Category A Senior Secondary subjects in the assessment of ApL subjects and differentiating candidates with outstanding performance through five grades (i.e. level 1 to level 5, with level 5 further subdivided into 5* and 5**);

(5) as it is learnt that local universities attach relatively little importance to ApL subjects in consideration of student admission or simply disregard the results of such subjects in the HKDSE, ApL subjects are considered as an inferior option for candidates, or even be regarded as options for those with weaker academic performance, of the means through which the authorities enhance the recognition of the subjects;

(6) as it is learnt that credits earned by Australian high school students in VPET courses at upper secondary level can be directly transferred to certain university programmes, thereby increasing the incentives for students to pursue VPET education, following the establishment of the new UAS, whether the authorities will consider promoting collaboration between universities and secondary schools to strengthen articulation between ApL subjects and university programmes; and

(7) following the establishment of the UAS Alliance in November last year, of new policy initiatives put in place by the authorities to further promote the deep integration of UAS programmes with the industries concerned?

Reply:

President,

 The reply to the questions raised by the Hon Leung Man-kwong is as follows:

(1) to (3) Applied Learning (ApL) is a valued senior secondary elective subject under Category B of the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE). It complements senior secondary subjects under Category A (subjects under the Key Learning Areas) and Category C (Other Languages courses), enriching students' subject choices. ApL, putting dual emphasis on theory and practice, is linked to vocational and professional fields. It helps students enhance their understanding of vocational and professional education and training (VPET), and prepares them for further studies and career pursuits in the future.

 ApL has expanded from 30 courses at its inception to nearly 60 courses at present (please refer to the Education Bureau (EDB) website at www.edb.gov.hk/apl/courselist2028HKDSE for the list of courses). It covers six Areas of Studies, namely:
(1) Creative Studies;
(2) Media and Communication;
(3) Business, Management and Law;
(4) Services;
(5) Applied Science; and
(6) Engineering and Production.

 Students may choose to take suitable courses based on their interests, aspirations and abilities. As students' learning interests, aspirations and abilities vary, it is normal for variance in enrolment figures across different ApL courses.

 In curriculum planning, the EDB uphold professional principles and holistically consider factors such as student needs, social development and resources, rather than relying solely on the enrolment figures as the basis for planning. A variety of courses are offered to cater for students with diverse abilities, interests and career aspirations. To assure course quality, the EDB has established a quality assurance mechanism involving the Curriculum Development Council Committee on ApL, the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications, and the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority (HKEAA). This ensures that the course design, implementation and learning outcomes meet the set standards.

 The EDB continuously collects data and feedback from stakeholders to review the effectiveness of the implementation of ApL courses. The number of candidates entering for the HKDSE ApL subjects has continued to increase over the past five years, showing a notable increase from 3 430 in 2021 to 7 891 in 2025. The percentage of candidates taking ApL subjects has risen from 6.6 per cent in 2021 to 14.1 per cent in 2025 (see Annex for details). Approximately 90 per cent of the candidates achieved ""Attained"" or above, and the percentage of candidates achieving ""Attained with Distinction"" (including ""Attained with Distinction (I)"" and ""Attained with Distinction (II)"") ranged from 26 per cent to 32 per cent. In addition, stakeholders including schools, students, parents and course providers express high satisfaction with ApL and agree on ApL's positive impact on students' personal growth, generic skills, industry knowledge, and future development. Data shows that over 90 per cent of ApL graduates have pursued further studies, articulating to different programmes, while about 5 per cent have taken up full-time or part-time employment. Overall, the enrolment of ApL shows an upward trend; candidate performance remains stable; and the courses help students explore future pathways.

 The EDB will continue to review and renew ApL courses, gauge stakeholders' views by engaging the industry and the education sectors in close communication, and maintain regular exchanges with course providers, so as to develop diversified and up-to-date ApL courses, such as the new courses related to generative artificial intelligence and low-altitude economy introduced this year, to enrich students' subject choices.

(4) The duration of each ApL subject is 180 contact hours. The learning content focuses on practical learning elements with dual emphasis on theory and practice linked to vocational and professional fields. There is no public examination, and the assessment is administered by the respective course providers. ApL and Category A subjects differ in terms of course duration, learning content and assessment, hence making direct comparisons between the two is not appropriate. As for the grading of ApL, the EDB are collecting views from stakeholders and in discussion with the HKEAA to explore the feasibility of optimising the results reporting of ApL.

(5) to (7) University admission has been following the principle of institutional autonomy. Individual institutions, faculties or programmes may consider ApL subjects as electives, or subjects for award of extra bonus or additional information. Taking the applied degree programmes of universities of applied sciences (UAS) as an example, ApL subjects are considered as elective subjects for most of these programmes. The EDB will continue to communicate with post-secondary institutions to promote ApL and deepen their understanding of ApL. The EDB also publicise through different means and channels, including organising course exhibitions, broadcasting television announcements of public interest and videos on ApL graduates' success stories as well as arranging parent seminars (relevant information has been uploaded onto the EDB website at www.edb.gov.hk/en/apl/ref-and-resources), to deepen the understanding of ApL among stakeholders and the public, thereby enhancing the recognition of ApL.

 In fact, the Government has been promoting VPET through the strategy of fostering industry-institution collaboration and diversified development, encouraging young people to choose their articulation pathways and join different industries based on their abilities and interests. Specifically, in order to strengthen the VPET articulation pathway and enhance the status of VPET at degree level, the Government promulgated the criteria for qualifying as UAS in February 2024. Subsequently, the Government announced that the Hong Kong Metropolitan University and Saint Francis University had undergone stringent procedures and reviews and qualified as the first two UAS in Hong Kong in March and November 2024 respectively. The Government will continue to promote the development of UAS and support more post-secondary institutions that are capable and aspire to become UAS to develop along that direction and make relevant planning. Through the Alliance of UAS established in November 2024, the Government will also encourage post-secondary institutions to carry out joint promotion with the industries and the school sector to provide diversified pathways for students of different backgrounds.

 In addition, with the support from the EDB, the Vocational Training Council (VTC) has launched in secondary schools an innovative pilot project, the Diploma of Vocational Education (Senior Secondary Curriculum) (DVE(SSC)), starting from the 2023/24 academic year, to allow senior secondary school students to pursue VPET-related programmes embedded in the HKDSE curriculum. The pilot project integrates VPET elements into the HKDSE framework, covering Vocational English and Vocational Chinese, relevant Category A elective subjects of the HKDSE with additional lesson hours of extended learning, ApL courses and Other Learning Experiences. Upon completion of the programme, students will be awarded, alongside their HKDSE qualification, a DVE(SSC) at Qualifications Framework Level 3 and may articulate to relevant Higher Diploma programmes of VTC, thereby enhancing the VPET articulation pathway. In the 2025/26 academic year, the pilot project covers two subject areas, namely "" Hospitality"" and ""Information Technology"", with around 120 participating students from six secondary schools. The EDB will continue to support the relevant work."
"LCQ3: Regulating ""premade dishes""",2025-09-25 11:33,2025-09-25 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500522.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Edmund Wong and a reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  It is learnt that in recent years, many restaurants have purchased ""premade dishes"" from external sources or produced them in-house to enhance efficiency and reduce operating costs. However, Hong Kong currently has no dedicated legislation governing the production, transportation and sale of premade dishes, and protecting the relevant consumer rights. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of cases involving food safety problems in restaurants received by the Government in each of the past three years and, among them, the number of those involving premade dishes;

(2) as the State Administration for Market Regulation and five other ministries jointly issued the Notice of Strengthening the Regulation of the Food Safety of Premade Dishes and Promoting the High-Quality Development of the Industry last year, which for the first time clearly defines premade dishes and their scope and enhances the regulation of the food safety of premade dishes, whether the authorities will make reference to such practices in order to strengthen the regulation of premade dishes; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as some consumers are of the view that they have the right to know whether the food provided by restaurants is a premade dish before patronizing them, whether the authorities will consider requiring restaurants to label food that is a premade dish; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  ""Prepared dishes"" is a relatively new term which has yet to have a standardised international definition. Interpretations of what constitutes ""prepared dishes"" can vary among different members of the trade and consumers. Generally, ""prepared dishes"" refer to finished or semi-finished foods upon processing and cooking, including dishes that only require reheating before consumption.

  From the perspective of food safety, all food items sold in Hong Kong, regardless of whether they are ""prepared dishes"" or not, are subject to stringent regulation and they must comply with the requirements as set out in food safety legislation. Local food factories must obtain a food factory licence from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) under the Food Business Regulation. For foods not produced locally, the Food Safety Ordinance stipulates that food importers and distributors shall keep food records to ensure that the Government can trace the source of food items quickly and effectively for appropriate follow-up actions.

  Certain high-risk imported foods are subject to specific legislation and must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by the competent authority of the place of origin and an import permission issued by the FEHD. Restaurants must comply with all relevant legislation and licencing requirements when serving food. In the event of food safety complaints or incidents, the FEHD will conduct investigations and institute prosecutions under the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance.

  In other words, different types of food, including ""prepared dishes"", are regulated by existing food safety legislation at all stages from production and import to sale. To assist the trade in understanding the pertinent requirements, the FEHD published the Food Hygiene Code, which spells out the food hygiene and safety standards that food premises must follow based on statutory and licencing conditions. The Code covers various aspects of production, handling, delivery, storage, and sale of different types of food, and offers recommendations and guidelines for meeting these standards.

  Regarding the questions raised by the Hon Wong, my reply is as follows:

(1) From 2023 until August of this year, the FEHD performed over 446000 inspections at licensed/permitted food premises and instituted a total of 4 215 prosecutions involving various food safety irregularities. As food premises serving or not serving ""prepared dishes"" shall meet the same food safety and environmental hygiene conditions, the FEHD does not keep separate prosecution figures specifically related to ""prepared dishes"".

  Besides, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) collects food samples for testing at import, wholesale and retail levels under a risk-based principle on an ongoing basis. During the same period, the CFS tested about 1 350 prepackaged food samples for chemical, microbiological, and radiation levels. Except for one sample with unsatisfactory result in the microbiological test, the results of all other samples were satisfactory. The satisfactory rate is comparable with the overall rate for CFS's Food Surveillance Programme.

(2) The Mainland authorities issued the Notice of Strengthening the Regulation of the Food Safety of Premade Dishes and Promoting the High-Quality Development of the Industry in March last year. The Notice proposed the formulation of food safety standards for ""prepared dishes"", along with various measures to strengthen the regulation of the food safety of ""prepared dishes"" and promote the high-quality development of the ""prepared dishes"" industry. In June this year, the CFS also released Prepared Dishes - Food Safety Advice for Food Businesses and Consumers to assist the trade in taking appropriate measures for producing and supplying safe and hygienic ""prepared dishes"". For instance, the food trade is reminded to cook and reheat ""prepared dishes"" thoroughly, and make sure that the cold chain is well maintained during transportation and storage to prevent ""prepared dishes"" from being exposed to the ""Temperature Danger Zone"" (i.e. between 4°C and 60°C), etc.

(3) The Notice issued by the Mainland authorities calls for stepping up the promotion of explicit labelling of ""prepared dishes"" in the catering sector, yet such a recommendation is an encouragement by nature. It is not mandatory with any binding effect. From the perspective of food safety, the safety of food served in restaurants does not depend on whether or not prepared ingredients are used. Imposing a mandatory labelling requirement on restaurants will not lead to further improvement in food safety.

  As for consumers who wish to know whether a restaurant serves ""prepared dishes"" before visiting, as mentioned earlier, the understanding and expectations of individuals regarding what constitutes ""prepared dishes"" differ. For instance, should any dish containing prepared ingredients be regarded as a ""prepared dish""? In some cases where only certain ingredients are prepared while the rest are made freshly on-site, should the dish still be classified as a ""prepared dish""? Is it reasonable and practical to require restaurants to list the prepared ingredients of each dish separately? These are factors that we have to take into account.

  In reality, given the wide variety of ingredients and cooking methods, it is challenging to establish a precise and clear definition of ""prepared dishes"". If a mandatory labelling requirement for ""prepared dishes"" is imposed on ""prepared dishes"", not only would it present enforcement challenges, but also potentially give rise to disagreements between restaurants and consumers.

  President, with advancements in processing and packaging technologies, prepared foods and ingredients have continued to become better in various aspects of preservation, sterilisation, quality and taste. We support the food trade's endeavours to innovate and change to meet market demands as well as to keep optimising the food supply chain.

  As I mentioned earlier, the term ""prepared dishes"" is relatively recent, and the Mainland is researching the establishment of national standards for the food safety of these dishes. There are also media reports on an upcoming plan by the National Health Commission to solicit public views on its draft legislation on National Standards for the Food Safety of Premade Dishes. We will closely monitor the development of ""prepared dishes"" both on the Mainland and locally, as well as implement suitable measures to safeguard public health and promote high-quality development of the food trade.

  Thank you, President."
立法會三題：監管「預製菜」食品,2025-09-25 11:33,2025-09-25 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500517.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上黃俊碩議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的答覆︰

問題：

據悉近年不少食肆為了提升效率及降低營運成本，向外採購或自行生產「預製菜」以供顧客享用。然而，現時香港並無專門監管製作、運輸和銷售預製菜，以及保障消費者相關權益的法例。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年政府接獲多少宗涉及食肆出現食物安全問題的個案，以及當中涉及預製菜食品的數目為何；

（二）鑑於國家市場監管總局等六個部門於去年聯合發布《關於加強預製菜食品安全監管促進產業高質量發展通知》，首次明確預製菜定義及範圍，強化預製菜食品安全監管，當局會否參考有關做法以加強監管預製菜食品；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有消費者認為，他們有權利在光顧食肆前知悉食肆所提供的食物是否屬預製菜，當局會否考慮規定食肆須標明屬於預製菜的食物；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

「預製菜」是一個比較新的詞語，在國際間還沒有劃一的定義，不同業界人士與消費者對何謂「預製菜」都可能有不同理解和期望。一般來說，「預製菜」泛指經加工和配製後成為製成品或半製成品的食物，包括只需翻熱即可食用的菜式。

從食物安全角度看，不論是否「預製菜」，所有在香港出售的食物都受到嚴格規管，必須符合食物安全法例的要求。本港的食物生產工場必須持有食物環境衞生署（食環署）根據《食物業規例》發出的食物製造廠牌照。若食物並非在香港生產，《食物安全條例》亦規定食物進口商和分銷商必須備存食物紀錄，確保當局能快速有效追蹤食物來源和採取相應跟進行動。

一些風險較高的進口食物會受特定法例規管，必須附有由來源地有關當局發出的衞生證明書及食環署發出的進口准許。食肆供應食物均必須符合相關法例和發牌要求。如有任何涉及食物安全的投訴或事故，食環署會按《公眾衞生及市政條例》作出調查及提出檢控。

換言之，不同種類的食品，包括一般概念的「預製菜」，從生產、進口到售賣的各個環節，均受到現行食物安全法例的監管。而為了協助業界明白有關要求，食環署出版了《食物衞生守則》，說明食物業處所根據法例和牌照條件須遵守的各項食物衞生及安全標準。該《守則》涵蓋不同種類食物的製作、處理、運送、貯存及銷售等各個範疇，並就如何符合標準提供建議和指引。

就黃議員的提問，我現回覆如下：

（一）由二○二三年至今年八月，食環署對持牌／持證食物業處所進行了超過446 000次巡查，並就各類涉及食物安全的違規情況提出共4 215宗檢控。由於食物業處所需要符合的食物安全和環境衞生條件不會因為它是否售賣「預製菜」而有所分別，所以署方並無備存涉及「預製菜」的檢控分項數字。

此外，食物安全中心（食安中心）一直按風險為本的原則在進口、批發及零售層面抽檢食物樣本。同期，食安中心共抽取逾1 350個預製食品樣本作化學、微生物及輻射檢測，當中除一個樣本的微生物檢測結果不合格外，其餘均測試合格，合格率與食物監測計劃的整體數字相若。

（二）內地相關當局去年三月發布《關於加強預製菜食品安全監管促進產業高質量發展的通知》，提出研究制定「預製菜」食品安全標準，以及多項有關加強「預製菜」食品安全監管和促進「預製菜」產業高質量發展的工作。特區政府食安中心也於今年六月發布了《預製菜—給食物業及消費者的食物安全建議》，協助業界採取適當措施，製作和供應安全衞生的「預製菜」，例如提醒食物業應徹底烹煮及翻熱「預製菜」，並在運輸及貯存過程中保持良好的冷鏈系統，避免「預製菜」暴露於「危險溫度範圍」（即攝氏4度至60度）等。

（三）內地當局的《通知》提出大力推廣餐飲環節使用「預製菜」明示，不過這方面的建議並非強制性，而是鼓勵性質，不具約束力。從食物安全的角度來說，食肆出售的食物是否安全，與是否採用預製食材沒有關係，強制食肆為此作出標示並不會進一步改善食物安全。

至於有消費者希望在光顧食肆前知悉食肆所提供的食物是否屬「預製菜」，如前述，社會上不同人對甚麼是「預製菜」會有不同理解和期望。例如是否任何包含預製食材製作的菜式都是「預製菜」？如果一道菜式只有部分材料是預製，而其他部分都是現場即製，又是否將其歸類為「預製菜」？如果要求食肆把每道菜式的預製成分都要分列出來，又是否合理和現實上可行？這些都是我們需要考慮的因素。

事實上，食材的種類眾多，烹調方法也五花八門，並不容易為「預製菜」訂出準確清晰的定義。假如硬性規定食肆須標明屬於「預製菜」的食物，不但會難以執行，也容易引發食肆和消費者之間的爭拗。

主席，隨着加工和包裝技術進步，預製食品和食材在保鮮、殺菌、品質和口感各方面都在不斷改良。我們支持食物業界求變創新，配合市場需要，持續優化食物供應鏈。

正如我剛才所說，「預製菜」是比較新的概念，內地亦正就制定「預製菜」食品安全國家標準作出研究。有報道指國家衞健委（國家衞生健康委員會）即將就其主導的《預製菜食品安全國家標準》草案向社會公開徵求意見。我們會密切留意內地及本地有關「預製菜」的發展情況，有需要時會採取相應措施，保障市民健康及推動業界高質量發展。

多謝主席。"

立法會二十一題：車輛運載貨物的規管,2025-09-25 11:25,2025-09-25 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092300520.htm,"​以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上陳健波議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

根據《道路交通（交通管制）規例》（第374G章），司機須確保負載物適當地固定或盛載在車輛上，而負載物的重量和其擺放的方法，均不可對任何人士造成危險。然而，據報不時有貨車運載的建築材料或沙石墜落路面，以致行駛車輛的擋風玻璃被捲起沙石擊中的意外發生，危及道路使用者的安全。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年政府根據第374G章就違反規管車輛運載貨物條文的執法數目，以及提出的檢控個案宗數為何；

（二）鑑於有保險業界人士反映，涉及行經屯門至赤鱲角連接路、吐露港公路及元朗公路車輛的擋風玻璃損壞索償個案數量較多，當局會否考慮要求承辦商增加該三個路段的清掃頻率，以確保路面沙石或障礙物盡快獲得清理，從而減少車輛損壞的機會；及

（三）會否安排香港警務處、路政署、食物環境衞生署等相關政府部門展開聯合行動，加強打擊車輛運載物件跌出車外及散落路面，以及超載貨物等違規行為；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直非常關注道路安全，以及車輛在行車時未有適當盛載或固定負載物而產生的道路安全問題。就陳健波議員的提問，經諮詢香港警務處（警務處）、路政署及運輸署後，我現回覆如下：

（一）根據《道路交通（交通管制）規例》（第374G章），司機須確保負載物適當地固定或盛載在車輛上，而負載物的重量和其擺放的方法，均不可對任何人士造成危險。司機違反有關規例，如屬首次定罪，最高可處罰款五千元及監禁三個月。如屬第二次被定罪或隨後再次被定罪，最高可處罰款一萬元及監禁六個月。警務處負責就有關違規事項執法。

此外，運輸署亦根據上述規例，以及《行車隧道（政府）規例》（第368A章）、《青馬管制區（一般）規例》（第498B章）及《青沙管制區（一般）規例》（第594A章），於政府隧道、青馬管制區及青沙管制區範圍內就未有穩妥固定負載物的車輛執法。這三項附屬法例的規定和罰則，與上述第374G章所訂的大致相若。

在二○二二、二○二三及二○二四年，涉及有關載貨不穩的檢控數字分別為844宗、705宗及588宗。

（二）現時，路政署委聘承辦商每日巡查及清掃轄下快速道路（包括問題所指的吐露港公路、元朗公路和順朗路（即屯門至赤鱲角連接路南段）等），以減低路面障礙物對道路使用者造成的風險。

承辦商採用專用道路清掃車，以吸力或滾刷設備收集塵土、沙石及其他碎屑。若遇上障礙物或建築物料散落路面的情況，承辦商會即時調派額外人手和設備，以加快清理進度。路政署除定期審視承辦商的工作紀錄外，主管人員亦會不時到現場巡查，抽查清掃效果，包括路面清潔程度、沙石殘留情況及交通安全安排。路政署為清理快速道路上的障礙物訂立服務承諾，確保承辦商能迅速處理有關情況；根據紀錄，過去三年的個案全部達標。上述的處理機制，包括每日恆常巡查和清掃，以及因應實際情況即時作出清理安排，已能有效地清掃路面及清理障礙物。路政署會繼續密切監察承辦商的服務表現，提升路面清潔程度。

此外，運輸署委聘營辦商負責政府隧道的管理、營運及維修工作。在隧道範圍內的道路，例如屯門──赤鱲角隧道（即屯門至赤鱲角連接路北段），營辦商除定期清理行車道上的障礙物並以機動掃街車清掃路面外，亦會在例行巡邏期間或接獲報告時，即時處理路面障礙物或積聚沙石。營辦商近年已增加清理路面的次數。運輸署會繼續密切監察承辦商的服務表現，以保障道路安全。

（三）政府相關部門一直非常關注汽車負載物不穩固及超載，交換資訊並合作提升處理有關問題。警務處特別留意各類型貨車的違規情況，通過宣傳、教育及執法改變駕駛者的不負責任行為，保障道路使用者安全。警務處亦持續監察嚴重及致命交通意外的數據，並因應事故成因及趨勢，展開全港性專題執法行動，包括於今年九月進行的「打擊貨車違例行為」行動，以提升整體道路安全水平。

運輸署亦一直透過不同渠道進行宣傳和教育，加強貨車業界對載貨安全的認識。例如，根據《道路交通條例》（第374章）制訂《車輛載貨守則》，就載貨安全的不同範疇提供指引，包括選用適當車輛運載貨物、車上貨物擺放的正確方法等；出版《貨車運輸通訊》和與貨車業界舉行定期會議；在交通燈控制器上張貼宣傳畫貼，宣傳有關道路安全信息，提醒司機必須採取適當措施運載貨物；以及由隧道營辦商透過隧道區內可變信息顯示屏提醒司機採取適當措施，確保貨物穩妥繫牢等。

運輸署及警務處亦持續合作積極探索應用新科技，提升執法效率及加強道路安全。最近，警務處首次在非市區路段試驗使用無人機作交通錄影執法，打擊危險駕駛行為。警務處將會檢討成效，考慮擴展至其他地區或違例項目的可行性，例如負載物不穩固及超載等。

運輸署及警務處會繼續協力，聯同道路安全議會進行不同的宣傳及教育，例如出版和派發《道路安全通訊》及透過社交媒體平台發放資訊等，加強道路使用者的安全意識，提升載貨安全。"
LCQ21: Regulating use of vehicles for carriage of loads,2025-09-25 11:25,2025-09-25 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092300502.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Chan Kin-por and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

Under the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations (Cap. 374G), a driver shall ensure that any load is properly secured to or contained on the vehicle and that its weight and the manner in which it is placed shall not cause danger to any person. However, it has been reported that construction materials or rubble carried by goods vehicles fall onto the ground from time to time, causing accidents where the windshields of moving vehicles are hit by the rubble stirred up, endangering the safety of road users. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of enforcement actions taken by the Government under Cap. 374G against breaches of the provisions governing use of vehicles for carriage of loads, and the number of prosecutions instituted, in each of the past three years;

(2) as some members of the insurance industry have relayed that there are a relatively large number of windshield damage claims involving vehicles passing through the Tuen Mun - Chek Lap Kok Link, Tolo Highway, and Yuen Long Highway, whether the authorities will consider requiring contractors to increase the frequency of cleaning on these three roads to ensure that rubble or obstacles on the ground are cleared expeditiously, thereby reducing the chances of vehicle damage; and

(3) whether it will arrange for relevant government departments, such as the Hong Kong Police Force, Highways Department, and Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, to carry out joint operations to step up efforts in combating illegal acts such as falling and scattering of objects from vehicles on the ground, as well as overloading of loads; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

The Government all along attaches great importance to road safety and the road safety issues caused by moving vehicles with loads which are not properly contained or secured. Having consulted the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF), the Highways Department (HyD) and the Transport Department (TD), my response to the question raised by the Hon Chan Kin-por is as follows:

(1) Under the Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations (Cap. 374G), the driver shall ensure that any load is properly secured to or contained inside the vehicle and that its weight and manner in which it is placed in the vehicle shall not cause danger to any person. Any driver who contravenes the relevant regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for three months on first conviction; and to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for six months on second or subsequent convictions. The HKPF is responsible for law enforcement on related contraventions.

Moreover, according to the aforementioned regulations, as well as the Road Tunnels (Government) Regulations (Cap. 368A), the Tsing Ma Control Area (General) Regulation (Cap. 498B) and the Tsing Sha Control Area (General) Regulation (Cap. 594A), the TD takes enforcement actions against vehicles failing to properly secure their loads in the area of government tunnels, the Tsing Ma Control Area and the Tsing Sha Control Area. The requirements and penalties under these three pieces of subsidiary legislation are on par with those stipulated in the aforementioned Cap. 374G.

In 2022, 2023 and 2024, the number of prosecutions for insecure loading was 844, 705 and 588 respectively.

(2) Currently, the HyD engages contractors to carry out inspections and conduct road cleaning on expressways (including the Tolo Highway, Yuen Long Highway and Shun Long Road (i.e. the southern section of the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link) referred to in the question) on a daily basis to minimise the risks posed by obstacles on road surface to road users.

The contractors use specialised road sweepers equipped with suction or roller brushes to collect dust, gravel and other debris. In case obstacles or construction materials are found scattered on the road surface, the contractors will immediately deploy additional manpower and equipment to expedite the clearance process. In addition to regular review of contractors' work records, the HyD supervisory staff conduct frequent on-site inspections to assess cleaning effectiveness, including road surface cleanliness, residual sand and gravel, and road safety arrangements. The HyD also establishes performance pledges for clearing obstacles on expressways to ensure prompt contractor response. Records indicate that all cases over the past three years have met this standard. The aforementioned mechanism, consisting of daily routine inspections and cleaning, and immediate clearance arrangements in response to actual situations, is effective in cleaning road surfaces and removing obstacles. The HyD will continue to closely monitor contractors' performance to enhance road surface cleanliness.

Moreover, the TD engages operators to manage, operate, and maintain government tunnels. For road sections within tunnel areas, such as the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Tunnel (i.e. the northern section of the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link), the operator removes obstacles from carriageways and sweeps road surfaces with mechanical street sweepers regularly, and also clears road obstacles or accumulated gravel during routine patrols or upon receiving reports. The operator has increased the frequency of road surface cleaning in the recent years. The TD will continue to closely monitor the contractor's performance to ensure road safety.

(3) The relevant government departments have expressed significant concern over insecure vehicle loads and overloading, and are actively collaborating and sharing information to improve the management of these issues. The HKPF has been paying particular attention to such violations, especially those involving various types of goods vehicles, and seeks to change irresponsible driving behaviour through publicity, education and enforcement, with a view to safeguarding the safety of road users. The HKPF also continuously monitors data on serious and fatal traffic accidents and conducts territory-wide enforcement operations in response to accident causes and emerging trends. These include the ""Crackdown on Lorry Offences"" operation conducted in September this year, with the aim of enhancing overall road safety.

The TD has been conducting publicity and educational activities through various channels to enhance the goods vehicle trade's awareness of safe loading. For example, a Code of Practice for the Loading of Vehicles is compiled in accordance with the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374), which provides guidelines covering various areas of safe loading, including the use of suitable vehicles for carrying loads, proper methods of placing loads inside vehicles, etc. The TD also issues the Goods Vehicle Trade Newsletter and holds regular meetings with the goods vehicle trade. Posters are affixed on traffic signal controllers to promote road safety and remind drivers to adopt appropriate measures to secure loads. The tunnel operators display messages on variable message signs to remind drivers to secure the loads properly.

The TD and the HKPF will continue to collaborate proactively in exploring the application of new technologies to enhance enforcement efficiency and strengthen road safety. Recently, the HKPF conducted the first trial of drone-assisted traffic enforcement on non-urban road sections to combat dangerous driving. The HKPF will review the effectiveness of the trial and consider the feasibility of extending the initiative to other areas or offence types, including insecure vehicle loads and overloading.

The TD and the HKPF will continue to work with the Road Safety Council to conduct various publicity and educational programmes, such as publishing and distributing the Road Safety Bulletin, and disseminating information through social media platforms, to enhance road users' awareness of safety and safe loading."
立法會五題：保障惡劣天氣下僱員的安全和權益,2025-09-25 11:24,2025-09-25 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500512.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上郭偉强議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

有意見認為，現時勞工處制訂的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》（《守則》）欠缺法律效力，對「指定人員」的定義模糊，不利於保障僱員安全和權益。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，勞工處接獲僱員因惡劣天氣或「極端情況」，以致未能或及時返回工作崗位而被解僱、扣減工資、勤工獎、津貼、年假、法定假日或休息日，又或被要求以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工時的求助及投訴個案數目為何；

（二）會否就《守則》下的指定人員訂定清晰定義，要求僱主在招聘「指定人員」時清晰告知其工作安排，以及在惡劣天氣及「極端情況」出現時對工作環境作風險評估，並為仍須上班的指定人員提供膳食和交通津貼；及

（三）會否立法訂明惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下的停工安排，規定非緊急服務工種無須上班，並要求僱主不得對因該等情況缺勤或遲到的僱員扣薪或扣假；如會，立法詳情及時間表為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

一直以來，勞工處呼籲僱主應因應行業的實際運作需要、僱員工作及往返工作地點的安全等因素，預先和僱員制定在惡劣天氣下的工作安排和應變措施。勞工處發布的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》（《守則》），已就熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及「極端情況」發出時的工作安排，包括僱員上班、提早下班、復工及遙距工作等，為僱主和僱員提供實務指引和參考示例。

《守則》提醒僱主制定有關工作安排和應變措施時，須參照以下的基本原則，包括要充分諮詢及考慮員工的意見、必須履行勞工法例下的責任及規定、以僱員的安全為首要考慮、將在工作地點當值的人數減至最少，以及體諒僱員的實際困難和需要，以情理兼備及彈性的方式處理僱員的出勤情況。

就議員提問的綜合回答如下：

在上班安排方面，僱主須按剛才所述的基本原則，訂定在惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下需要返回工作地點當值的員工，即「指定人員」。《守則》已提醒僱主須就「指定人員」的安全、交通及膳食等預早作好安排。

由於各行業職位的工作性質和營運模式，以至機構的人手調配各有不同，僱員是否需要返回工作地點或以其他方式候命及當值，須視乎實際情況。不少緊急以及與民生需要密切相關的服務，在惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下仍需維持運作及作出靈活調動，「一刀切」列明需要返回工作地點當值的工種和「指定人員」類別，實際操作上並不可行。

不同行業及工種亦有其相聯性或供應鏈的關係，環環緊扣，不能單純以個別行業及工種的一般性質決定是否屬於緊急服務。例如為醫院或院舍提供膳食的機構，假如其僱員停工，對醫院或院舍的運作可能帶來嚴重影響。另外，惡劣天氣或「極端情況」對僱員往返其工作和居住地區的影響程度各有不同。以立法方式規定在惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下的停工安排，對維持社會有效運作及盡早復常帶來負面影響，並削弱勞資雙方在工作安排上的靈活性，因此並不合適。

如僱員需要在惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下工作，根據《僱員補償條例》，在指明的惡劣天氣或「極端情況」生效期間，如僱員在其該日工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由居所前往工作地點途中，或在下班後由工作地點返回居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。另外，僱主須預先評估潛在的風險，並採取措施包括提供和維持安全的工作系統，把工作危險減至最低。如違反規定，最高可處罰款一千萬元及監禁兩年。

《僱傭條例》亦已有清晰條文保障僱員的權益。其中，僱主不可用僱員在該條例下的年假、法定假日或休息日，抵銷因惡劣天氣或「極端情況」下僱員未能上班工作的時間。僱主如無合理辯解而不遵守條例的相關規定，即屬違法。如僱員由於惡劣天氣或不受控制的環境因素影響而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位復工，僱主應體諒員工，不應因此扣薪。

勞工處目前雖沒有備存關於僱員因惡劣天氣或「極端情況」而引起的求助及投訴數字，僱傭雙方如有爭議，或僱員因惡劣天氣或「極端情況」遭遇不合理對待或合法權益受損，可向勞工處求助及申訴，勞工處勞資關係科會提供適切協助，致力調停或跟進調查。

多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Safeguarding employees' safety and interests in times of adverse weather,2025-09-25 11:24,2025-09-25 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500526.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kwok Wai-keung and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

  There are views that the existing ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" (the Code) formulated by the Labour Department (LD) lacks a legally binding effect and contains an ambiguous definition of ""designated staff"", which is not conducive to safeguarding employees' safety and interests. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of requests for assistance and complaints received by the LD over the past three years from employees who were dismissed, had their wages, good attendance bonus, allowances, annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days deducted owing to their inability to resume duty or inability to resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, or were asked for additional hours of work to compensate for the loss of working hours when they were unable to report for duty;

(2) whether it will provide a clear definition of designated staff under the Code, requiring employers to clearly inform these staff members of their work arrangements upon recruitment, conduct risk assessments on the working environment in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions, and provide meal and travel allowances to designated staff who are still required to report for duty; and

(3) whether it will legislate for work suspension arrangements in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions, stipulating that employees providing non-urgent services are not required to report for duty, and requiring employers not to deduct the salary or leave entitlements of employees who are absent from or late for work under such circumstances; if so, of the legislative details and timetable; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Labour Department (LD) has all along called on employers to formulate work arrangements and contingency measures under adverse weather together with their employees in advance, having regard to factors such as the actual operational needs of their industries, the safety of their employees both at work and during commuting to and from the workplaces, etc. The ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" (CoP), published by the LD, has provided practical guidelines and reference examples for employers and employees on work arrangements when tropical cyclones, rainstorm warnings and ""extreme conditions"" are in force, including reporting for duty, early release from work, resumption of work and remote work.

  The CoP reminds employers that they shall make reference to the following basic principles when formulating relevant work arrangements and contingency measures. The basic principles include fully consulting and considering employees' views, fulfilling obligations and requirements under the labour legislation, giving prime consideration to the safety of employees, keeping the number of staff required to report for duty at workplaces to the minimum, as well as taking into account employees' practical difficulties and needs, so as to handle employees' attendance matters in a considerate, sympathetic and flexible manner.

  The consolidated reply to the Member's question is as follows:

  With respect to arrangements for reporting for duty, employers shall specify employees who are required to report for duty at workplaces in times of adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"", i.e. ""designated staff"", in accordance with the aforesaid basic principles. The CoP has reminded employers that they shall make proper arrangements in respect of safety, transportation and meals, etc. for ""designated staff"" in advance.

  Owing to the diverse work nature and modes of operation of job categories across various industries and hence the differences in organisations' manpower deployment, whether employees need to return to their workplaces or remain on standby and duty in other ways depends on the actual circumstances. Many emergency services and services closely related to the livelihood need to maintain operation and make flexible adjustments during adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"". It is operationally impracticable to adopt a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach in specifying which job categories and types of ""designated staff"" should return to their workplaces to report for duty.

  Moreover, different industries and job categories have interrelated or supply chain relationships that are closely linked. It is infeasible to determine whether a service is an emergency service solely based on the general nature of an individual industry or job category. For example, the operation of hospitals or residential care homes may be severely impacted if employees of organisations providing meals to them suspend work. In addition, the impact of adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"" on employees commuting between their workplaces and residence varies. Legislating for work suspension arrangements under adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"" would pose adverse impact on maintaining the effective functioning of the society and the early resumption of normalcy, and would undermine the flexibility in work arrangements for both employers and employees. It is hence inappropriate to take the legislative approach.

  If employees have to work in times of adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"", pursuant to the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths occurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplaces, or from their workplaces back to their residence after work, within a period of four hours before or after the working hours on a day when the specified adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"" is in force. Besides, employers shall assess the potential risks in advance and implement measures, including the provision and maintenance of safe systems of work, to reduce the risks to the minimum. Contravention of the provisions is liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for two years.

  The Employment Ordinance also stipulates clear provisions to safeguard the rights of employees. Among them, employers are not allowed to use employees' annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Ordinance to offset the time when employees are unable to work due to adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"". An employer who without reasonable excuse fails to comply with relevant provisions of the Ordinance is in breach of the law. If employees are unable to report for duty at workplaces or resume work on time due to adverse weather or environmental factors beyond their control, the employers should be considerate towards the employees and should not consequently deduct their wages.

  While the LD currently does not keep figures on requests for assistance or complaints from employees arising from adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"", if there are disputes between employers and employees, or if employees encounter unreasonable treatment or infringement of their legal rights arising from adverse weather or ""extreme conditions"", they can seek help and lodge complaints with the LD. The Labour Relations Division of the LD will provide appropriate assistance, endeavouring to conciliate or conduct follow-up investigation.

  Thank you, President."

問題：

政府早前公布，截至今年七月三十一日，首批約13 000名簽證到期的「高端人才通行證計劃」（高才通計劃）人才中，近半未有申請續簽。此外，勞工及福利局局長早前接受傳媒採訪時指出，高才通計劃人才若未能成功續簽，其子女受養人便須退學離港。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）上述未有申請續簽的高才通計劃人才的在港就學子女受養人數目，以及當中已辦理退學申請的數目為何；

（二）政府有否設立機制，讓相關政府部門在確定高才通計劃人才未有提交續簽申請或不獲續簽後，通報其他政府部門處理有關子女受養人的就學安排；及

（三）有否考慮讓未有申請續簽的高才通計劃人才的子女保留學位，以非本地生身分繼續在港就學？

答覆：

主席：

在「一國兩制」制度優勢下，香港進出自由，一直是人才匯聚、探索機遇、洽商及交流的國際城市，而香港多元和優質的教育亦是吸引人才來港的因素之一。透過不同的人才入境計劃（包括「高端人才通行證計劃」（高才通計劃））來港人士的子女若符合入境事務處（入境處）訂明的條件，可以受養人身分申請並獲發簽證來港居留。根據現行教育政策，適齡的受養人亦合資格入讀公營學校，接受免費的中小學教育，或入讀其他學校（包括直接資助計劃學校和國際學校）。

根據《入境條例》（第115章），凡獲准在香港入境或留在香港的人士，入境處可向他們施加逗留期限及其他逗留條件。他們在留港期間須遵守入境處向其施加的逗留條件，並須於逗留期限屆滿當日或之前離開香港。受養人在香港的逗留期限一般會與其保證人的逗留期限掛鈎，若保證人不再申請或不獲准延長逗留期限，受養人就不再符合居港資格，並必須與其保證人一同於逗留期限屆滿前離港。

就議員的提問，經諮詢勞工及福利局、保安局及入境處後，現綜合回覆如下：

（一）及（二）根據現行安排，獲准以受養人身分來港居住的人士（包括但不限於各項人才入境計劃的成功申請人的受養人），可以在香港就學而無須事先獲得入境處處長批准。他們可以選擇入讀不同資助模式的中小學，而學校亦無須向教育局申報。因此，現時政府沒有備存該等受養人在港就學及退學申請的個案數字。

（三）一般而言，除擁有香港特區居留權或入境權的人士外，任何人士如欲來港就讀，均須申領入境簽證／進入許可。對於未有在高才通計劃下申請續簽的人士，其適齡就讀中小學的子女在符合有關政策規定情況下（包括已獲得相關非公營學校取錄），可向入境處申請來港就讀的簽證／進入許可。目前，相關安排不適用於包括內地的中國公民。詳情可參考相關網站:www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/study.html。"
Labour Department to use small unmanned aircraft to assist in law enforcement (with photos),2025-09-25 11:05,2025-09-25 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500483.htm,"  âThe Labour Department (LD) will start using small unmanned aircraft (SUA) from October to assist Occupational Safety Officers (OSOs) in conducting inspections and enforcement actions. A special inspection exercise using SUA will also be launched to combat unsafe work activities.

  The Commissioner for Labour, Mr Sam Hui, and the Deputy Commissioner (Occupational Safety and Health), Mr Vincent Fung, attended an SUA drill earlier to understand the operation of SUA by OSOs and its effectiveness in application.

  Mr Hui said, ""OSOs can utilise SUA to conduct aerial remote site surveillance in the future. Upon detecting unsafe work practices, OSOs will be able to take photos and videos immediately for evidence collection before deploying staff to enter the sites for law enforcement. In addition, SUA will also facilitate the inspection of remote or inaccessible workplaces, thereby significantly enhancing inspection efficiency.""

  The SUA adopted by the LD is equipped with superzoom and high-resolution cameras capable of shooting remote aerial photography and videography, assisting OSOs in collecting evidence during inspections and accident investigations.

  The LD will launch a special inspection exercise using SUA in October, focusing on construction sites with working-at-height activities to curb unsafe work practices. If any violation of the occupational safety and health (OSH) legislation is detected, the LD will take stringent enforcement actions immediately, including issuing suspension notices and improvement notices as well as initiating prosecutions without prior warning.

  The LD will continue to keep in view the application of technological products, including the latest technological developments of AI systems, and keep using technology to assist in law enforcement, with a view to enhancing the deterrent effect of the legislation and further safeguarding the OSH of workers."
LCQ10: Schooling arrangement for children of talent under Top Talent Pass Scheme,2025-09-25 11:05,2025-09-25 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500462.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Lam San-keung and a written reply by the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 The Government has announced earlier on that as of July 31 this year, nearly half of the first batch of approximately 13 000 talent with expired visas under the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) have not applied for visa extension. In addition, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare has indicated previously in a media interview that for those TTPS talent who fail to obtain visa extension, their dependant children will be required to drop out of school and leave Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of dependant children of the aforesaid TTPS talent who have not applied for visa extension studying in Hong Kong and, among them, the number of those who have applied for withdrawal from school;

(2) whether the Government has established a mechanism whereby the relevant government departments, after confirming that TTPS talent have not submitted visa extension applications or have not been granted visa extension, may notify other government departments to handle the schooling arrangement for the dependant children concerned; and

(3) whether it has considered allowing the children of TTPS talent who have not applied for visa extension to retain their school places and continue their studies in Hong Kong as non-local students?

Reply:

President,

 With the institutional advantages of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong is an international city where people enjoy freedom of movement and talent gather for exploration of opportunities, negotiations and exchanges. Hong Kong's diverse and quality education is also one of the factors attracting talent to Hong Kong. Children of those who come to Hong Kong under various talent admission schemes (including the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS)) may apply for and be issued with a visa for residence in Hong Kong as dependants, provided that they meet the criteria set by the Immigration Department (ImmD). Under the existing education policy, school-age dependants are also eligible to enrol in public sector schools to receive free primary and secondary education. They may also enrol in other schools, such as Direct Subsidy Scheme schools and international schools.

 Under the Immigration Ordinance (Cap. 115), where permission is given to a person to land or remain in Hong Kong, the ImmD may impose a limit of stay or other conditions of stay. Such persons must comply with the conditions of stay imposed by the ImmD during their stay in Hong Kong and are required to depart Hong Kong on or before the expiry date of their limit of stay. The limit of stay in Hong Kong of dependants is normally linked to that of their sponsors. In the case that a sponsor ceases to apply for an extension of stay or the application is rejected, the dependant will no longer be eligible for residence in Hong Kong and is required to depart Hong Kong together with the sponsor before the expiry of their limit of stay.

 In consultation with the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the Security Bureau and the ImmD, the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Member is as follows:

(1) and (2) Under the prevailing arrangement, persons who are permitted to reside in Hong Kong as dependants (including but not limited to dependants of successful applicants under various talent admission schemes) are not required to obtain prior permission from the Director of Immigration for studying in Hong Kong. They can choose to enrol in primary and secondary schools of different finance types, and the schools are not required to report to the Education Bureau. As such, the Government does not have the statistics on the number of such dependants studying in Hong Kong and the number of those who have applied for withdrawal from schools.

(3) In general, unless a person has the right of abode or right to land in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), he/she requires a visa/entry permit to study here. For those who have not applied for extension of stay under the TTPS, their school-age children for primary and secondary education who meet the related policy requirements (including having been admitted by relevant non-public sector schools) may apply to the ImmD for a visa/entry permit to enter the HKSAR for study. At present, such arrangement does not apply to, among others, Chinese nationals of the Mainland. For details, please refer to the relevant website: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/study.html."
LCQ8: Combating activities relating to duty-not-paid cigarettes,2025-09-25 11:00,2025-09-25 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092300405.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong and a written reply by the Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Joseph Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

 It has been reported that the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) indicated that a total of 12 441 cases of cross-boundary travellers smuggling cigarettes were detected in the first half of this year. Regarding the combating of activities relating to duty-not-paid cigarettes (illicit cigarettes), will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of Hong Kong residents and visitors caught smuggling or carrying excess quantities of cigarettes at various land boundary control points in the first half of this year, the changes in these figures as compared with the same period last year, and the respective quantities and values of the illicit cigarettes involved;

(2) given that according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Hong Kong received more than 20 million visitors in the first five months of this year, with Mainland visitors increasing by about 10 per cent year-on-year, whether the authorities have projected if the number of persons illegally carrying illicit cigarettes into Hong Kong will increase; if so, of the preventive measures in place; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) apart from increasing the penalty compoundable under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109) from $2,000 to $5,000 for bringing tobacco and other dutiable commodities into Hong Kong without proper declaration, of the publicity and educational efforts to be made by the authorities in future and the details of such efforts;

(4) it has been reported that advertisements and messages claiming to facilitate the sale and delivery of duty-not-paid illicit cigarettes to Hong Kong consumers via cross-boundary logistics channels have been posted on social media platforms, of the targeted countermeasures taken by the authorities to combat such smuggling; the number of relevant cases detected, the number of persons arrested and the dutiable value of the illicit cigarettes seized from 2024 to date;

(5) whether it has reviewed if the current staffing establishment of C&ED is sufficient to cope with the work of combating the bringing-in of illicit cigarettes; whether C&ED will consider increasing manpower to combat such contraventions; if C&ED will, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(6) whether C&ED has plans to adopt advanced and innovative technology to assist in combating illicit cigarettes in future; if so, of the details?

Reply:

President,

 Under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (Cap. 109) (the Ordinance), tobacco products are dutiable commodities. Importers or manufacturers shall pay tobacco duty according to the specified rates under the Ordinance. To protect government revenue, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) has been combating smuggling and trading of illicit cigarettes on different fronts.

 Upon consultation with the Health Bureau and C&ED, my reply to Dr the Hon Kennedy Wong's question is as follows:

(1) & (2) C&ED has been adjusting their enforcement strategies to combat the smuggling of illicit tobacco into Hong Kong having regard to the actual situation. Since May this year, C&ED has been presenting the monthly statistics on the number of cases involving seizure of excessive tobacco and liquor and their relevant penalties at all boundary control points (BCPs) and issued press releases on cases involving sentencing to remind visitors of the severity and legal consequences of relevant illegal activities in order to enhance the deterrent effect.

 The respective number of Hong Kong residents and visitors arrested for smuggling or carrying excess quantities of cigarettes at land control points in the first half of 2024 and 2025 and the quantities and values of the illicit cigarettes involved are listed in the table below:





January to June 2024

(3) The Tobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2025 (Amendment Bill) was passed by the Legislative Council on September 11, 2025 to implement a series of measures to combat illicit cigarettes, including raising the maximum penalty for relevant offences relating to duty-not-paid tobacco from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment; listing the relevant offences under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 455) to enable C&ED to freeze assets associated with illicit tobacco activities; increasing the penalty for offences of failing to declare to Customs Officers compoundable under the Ordinance from $2,000 to $5,000; and requiring that cigarettes sold at a price lower than the tobacco duty be proved to be duty-paid. The above measures have taken immediate effect upon the gazettal of the Amendment Bill on September 19.

 C&ED has collaborated with relevant government departments, including the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office of the Department of Health, the Police and the Housing Department, to launch a series of publicity and educational activities. Information on the increased penalties has been disseminated to the community and the public through multiple channels, including broadcasting and publishing a new series of videos, audio clips and posters on major television channels, radios, newspapers and C&ED's official social media platforms, and publishing a series of posts on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Xiaohongshu, WeChat, etc.

 In addition to presenting the monthly statistics on the number of cases and penalties at all BCPs as mentioned above, C&ED also disseminates information on the relevant offences and penalties to visitors through promotion videos, audio clips and mega posters at all BCPs, including the airport, land control points, etc. This serves to remind visitors that carrying dutiable commodities in excess of the duty-free concessions upon immigration is illegal and of the seriousness of the offence. To enhance the awareness of visitors from the Mainland of the new penalties, C&ED has placed advertisements at prominent locations at some Mainland land control points and the handles in the train compartments of metros in the Mainland.

 C&ED will continue to visit public housing estates in various districts, trade unions, etc., to conduct interdepartmental anti-illicit cigarettepublicity and educational activities and seminars. C&ED will also put up posters and broadcast promotion videos in all the 18 districts of Hong Kong to enhance public awareness of the relevant offences and penalties.

(4) C&ED has been closely monitoring sale of illicit cigarettes on the internet and conducting cyber patrols. When suspected cases are detected, C&ED will follow up with investigation and request the relevant websites or social media platforms to block the accounts concerned and remove the relevant illicit cigarette advertisements. From January to August 2025, a total of 266 relevant advertisements have been removed.

 On combatting cross-boundary logistics smuggling, C&ED detected 766 cases from January 2024 to August 2025 and seized about 670 million illicit cigarettes in total, with a duty potential of about $2.21 billion. A total of 188 persons have been arrested.

 C&ED will strengthen intelligence gathering and closely monitor the latest updates of illicit cigarettes activities. It will continue to strengthen enforcement at BCPs to intercept the inflow of illicit cigarettes into local markets. If illegal activities are detected, C&ED will take resolute enforcement actions.

(5) and (6) C&ED has been putting forward the development of Smart Customs to enhance detection capability and clearance efficiency through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data analytics to facilitate risk management. C&ED has fully deployed advanced non-intrusive inspection equipment, such as Computed Tomography Scanners with AI functions, auto-detection devices for X-ray checkers, Smart Under Vehicle Robots, Platform for X-ray Image Evaluation, Vehicle Inspection and Strategic Analysis System, etc., in order to combat illicit cigarettes activities more effectively. C&ED will introduce advanced equipment and innovative technologies as appropriate to continuously enhance the detection capabilities and enhance enforcement effectiveness in combatting illicit cigarette activities.

 In addition, C&ED has amended the Ordinance to implement a duty stamp system, requiring importers/local manufacturers to ensure that each package of duty-paid cigarettes is affixed with a duty stamp when being put on the market for sale. Through the application of anti-forgery features and related digital technologies, frontline officers of C&ED would be able to distinguish duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones in a more effective manner, enhancing efficiency of law enforcement. C&ED targets to implement the first phase of the duty stamp system in Q4 2026, with full implementation in Q2 2027.

 C&ED will review the staff establishment regularly and flexibly deploy resources to handle anti-illicit cigarette work."

立法會八題：打擊未完稅香煙活動,2025-09-25 11:00,2025-09-25 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092300404.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上黃英豪議員的提問和署理財經事務及庫務局局長陳浩濂的書面答覆：

問題：

據報香港海關（海關）表示今年上半年共查獲12 441宗跨境旅客走私香煙的案件。就打擊未完稅香煙（私煙）活動，政府可否告知本會：

（一）當局於本年上半年在各陸路口岸檢獲走私／超額攜帶香煙的港人與旅客數目、該等數字與去年同期比較的變化、涉及的私煙數量和價值分別為何；

（二）鑑於根據香港旅遊發展局的資料，今年首五個月訪港旅客人次超過2 000萬，其中內地旅客按年增加約百分之十，當局有否預計違規攜帶私煙入境的人士數目會否有所增加；如會，有何預防措施；如否，原因為何；

（三）針對沒有申報下攜帶煙草等應課稅貨品進入香港的行為，除了把《應課稅品條例》（第109章）下有代價地不予檢控罪行的罰款額，由2,000元提高至5,000元，當局在未來有何宣傳教育工作，以及有關工作的詳情為何；

（四）據報有人透過社交平台發布廣告和帖文，聲稱可配合跨境物流渠道向香港消費者銷售及運送未完稅私煙，當局採取了甚麼具針對性的應對措施，以打擊透過跨境物流走私香煙的行為；二○二四年至今當局偵破相關案件數目、被拘捕人士數目和檢獲私煙的應課稅值分別為何；

（五）有否檢視目前海關的人手編制是否足夠應付打擊攜帶私煙入境的工作；海關會否考慮增加人手打擊相關違規行為；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（六）海關未來有否計劃採用先進和創新科技協助打擊私煙；如有，詳情為何？

答覆：

主席︰

根據《應課稅品條例》（第109章）（《條例》），煙草產品屬應課稅品，入口商或製造商須按《條例》的稅率繳交煙草稅。為保障政府收入，香港海關（海關）一直從不同層面打擊走私和販賣私煙活動。

就黃英豪議員的提問，經諮詢醫務衞生局及海關後，我回覆如下︰

（一）及（二）海關一直根據實際情況調整執法策略，以防止私煙流入香港。海關自今年五月起於各口岸展示每月查獲攜帶超額煙酒案件數字及相應罰則，並針對涉及判刑的案件發放新聞稿，提醒旅客相關違法行為的嚴重性和法律後果，以加強阻嚇作用。

二○二四年及二○二五年的上半年在各陸路口岸因涉及走私／超額攜帶香煙被捕的香港居民與旅客數目、涉及的私煙數量和價值載列於下表︰

（三）立法會於二○二五年九月十一日通過《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》，推行一系列加強打擊私煙的措施，包括：將未完稅煙草相關的最高罰則由罰款100萬元及監禁兩年提高至罰款200萬元及監禁七年；把有關罪行列入《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章），容許海關凍結與違法煙草活動相關的資產；將《條例》下有代價地就未有向海關人員作出申報罪行不予檢控的罰則由2,000元提高至5,000元；以及規定售價低於煙草稅的煙支須證明已課稅。上述措施於修訂條例在九月十九日刊憲後已即時生效。

海關已聯同相關政府部門（包括衞生署控煙酒辦公室、警方和房屋署）展開了一連串宣傳教育工作，透過不同渠道向社區及市民發放有關加強罰則的資訊，包括於各大電視台、電台、報章及海關的官方社交平台播放及刊載全新一輯的短片、聲帶、海報，以及在社交媒體（例如：Facebook、Instagram、小紅書、微信等）刊登一系列帖文。

海關除了如上文提及在各口岸展示每月查獲案件數字及罰則外，亦在各入境管制站，包括機場和陸路口岸等，透過宣傳短片、聲帶和大型海報，向訪港旅客發布有關罪行和罰則的信息，提醒他們入境時攜帶超額免稅品屬違法及其嚴重性。為了提高內地旅客對新罰則的認知，海關亦在部分內地陸路口岸的顯眼位置及內地地鐵列車的拉手上放置宣傳廣告。

海關將繼續到訪各區公共屋邨、商會等進行跨部門反私煙宣傳教育活動及講座，亦會在全港十八區張貼海報和播放宣傳短片，以加強市民對相關罪行和罰則的認知。

（四）海關一直密切監察網上售賣私煙活動及進行網上巡邏。如發現懷疑個案，除跟進調查外，亦會要求有關網站或社交平台封鎖有關帳戶及移除相關私煙廣告。在二○二五年一月至八月期間，共有266個相關廣告已下架。

在打擊跨境物流走私案件方面，海關在二○二四年一月至二○二五年八月期間共偵破766宗案件，檢獲私煙約6.7億支，應課稅值約22.1億元，共拘捕188人。

海關會加強情報蒐集工作，密切留意私煙活動的最新情況，並繼續在邊境管制站加強執法力度，阻截私煙流入本地市場。如發現違法行為，海關會採取果斷執法行動。

（五）及（六）海關一直致力推進智慧海關，以提升偵測能力及清關效率，透過人工智能技術及大數據分析協助風險管理，並在各邊境管制站全面利用先進非入侵式查驗設備，例如具備人工智能的電腦斷層掃描檢查系統、X光檢查器自動偵測儀、智能車底機械人、X光影像分析支援系統、車輛查驗策略分析系統等，以更有效打擊私煙活動。海關會適時引入合適先進儀器和創新科技，持續加強偵測能力，提高執法成效以打擊私煙活動。

此外，海關已修訂《條例》以引入完稅標籤制度，規定進口商／本地製造商須確保每包已完稅香煙在市場銷售時均附貼完稅標籤，並透過應用防偽特徵及相關數碼技術，讓海關前線人員能更有效地分辨已完稅煙和未完稅煙，提升執法效率。海關預計完稅標籤制度的第一階段將在二○二六年第四季推出，並在二○二七年第二季全面實施。

海關會繼續定期檢視人手編制，並靈活調配資源處理反私煙工作。"

Speech by FS at Routes World 2025 (English only),2025-09-25 10:38,2025-09-25 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500482.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Routes World 2025 today (September 25):

Fred (Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam), Steven (Managing Director of Routes, Mr Steven Small), Vivian (Chief Executive Officer of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mrs Vivian Cheung),distinguished guests from the aviation industry, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. A very warm welcome to Routes World 2025. It is a great pleasure to join so many distinguished leaders and professionals from across the global aviation sector. While the inclement weather may have disrupted some of your plans to explore our city, I trust it has also offered you a glimpse into Hong Kong's resilience in tackling climate challenges, and the efficiency of our world-class city management.

First of all, thank you for hosting this landmark 30th edition of Routes World in Hong Kong. Over the next couple of days, you'll be sharing insights and experiences, and exploring the future pathways for air route development. These discussions are vital not only for shaping the future of global aviation, but also for fostering deeper economic collaboration, as well as understanding and friendship among peoples. I am proud that Hong Kong is serving as the meeting point for such meaningful dialogues.

We meet at a time of remarkable momentum in global aviation. According to the IATA, global air passenger traffic grew by over 10 per cent year-on-year in 2024. And despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts and economic uncertainties, passenger demand is projected to rise by another 6per cent this year. Air cargo volume is also expected to grow slightly, reaching 69 million tonnes. This growth is accompanied by a positive outlook on airline revenues and profitability, supported in part by more stable fuel prices.

Much of the above expansion and vitality is led by the Asia-Pacific region, where China accounts for over 40per cent of the regional traffic. Other regions, such as the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, are also seeing significant growth.

Hong Kong is benefiting from this global boom. Last year, our airport handled 53 million passengers, an increase of 34per cent year-on-year. In the first eight months of this year, we welcomed 40 million passengers, up another 15per cent. For 14 of the past 15 years, the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) has been the world's busiest cargo airport.

Today, our airport operates over 1 000 flights daily, connecting more than 210 destinations worldwide through some 140 airlines. To meet the rising demand, we are making substantial investments in our aviation infrastructure. The commissioning of the Three-Runway System last year was a major milestone. It enables our airport to handle up to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2035.

Complementing this is the HKIA's ""SKYTOPIA"" development plan, which will transform our airport from an aviation hub into a world-leading landmark for commerce, tourism, arts and leisure. It is indeed a visionary project, featuring art storage facilities, a state-of-the-art sportainment complex, Hong Kong's largest yacht marina, and more.

Thanks to our international connectivity, Hong Kong also serves as the preferred gateway for international travel by residents in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Currently, around 20per cent of our airport's passengers come from the GBA. With rising travel demand from this region, we see immense potential for this number to grow even further. To support this, we are enhancing the intermodal transport network in the GBA, and streamlining immigration and customs clearance procedures, to facilitate more efficient flows of passengers and cargo.

The world is changing rapidly, with geopolitics reshaping global economic dynamics and patterns of passenger travel.

  Notwithstanding this, China remains firmly committed to high-level two-way opening up, welcoming more international businesses and travellers. Its expanding unilateral visa exemption for more and more countries is a good case in point. Hong Kong’s role as a gateway to the Mainland will only grow stronger. As a matter of fact, in the first eight months of this year, travellers to Hong Kong from outside the Chinese Mainland reached 7.7 million, rising by 16per cent year-on-year.

In this connection, we are not only reinforcing ties with traditional partners in Europe and North America, but also expanding our network across the Global South, including ASEAN, the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America. We are actively working to introduce new destinations and increase flight frequencies with emerging markets, particularly for long-haul routes.

These efforts are already bearing fruit. Over the past two years, we have expanded bilateral air services agreements with more than 10 economies. In the past two months, we reached consensus with Chile and Poland respectively to work on new air services agreements that will further strengthen our connectivity with the economies in those regions.

Equally important is our commitment to sustainability. In the Policy Address delivered last week, we presented Hong Kong's vision in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). That includes developing the related industry chain in the GBA, the whole chain from upstream to downstream. This initiative will support our goal of achieving the targeted SAF consumption ratio for flights departing from the HKIA by 2030, and in becoming a leader in SAF in this region.

Fred (Chairman of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mr Fred Lam), Steven (Managing Director of Routes, Mr Steven Small), Vivian (Chief Executive Officer of the Airport Authority Hong Kong, Mrs Vivian Cheung),distinguished guests from the aviation industry, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. A very warm welcome to Routes World 2025. It is a great pleasure to join so many distinguished leaders and professionals from across the global aviation sector. While the inclement weather may have disrupted some of your plans to explore our city, I trust it has also offered you a glimpse into Hong Kong's resilience in tackling climate challenges, and the efficiency of our world-class city management.

First of all, thank you for hosting this landmark 30th edition of Routes World in Hong Kong. Over the next couple of days, you'll be sharing insights and experiences, and exploring the future pathways for air route development. These discussions are vital not only for shaping the future of global aviation, but also for fostering deeper economic collaboration, as well as understanding and friendship among peoples. I am proud that Hong Kong is serving as the meeting point for such meaningful dialogues.

We meet at a time of remarkable momentum in global aviation. According to the IATA, global air passenger traffic grew by over 10 per cent year-on-year in 2024. And despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts and economic uncertainties, passenger demand is projected to rise by another 6per cent this year. Air cargo volume is also expected to grow slightly, reaching 69 million tonnes. This growth is accompanied by a positive outlook on airline revenues and profitability, supported in part by more stable fuel prices.

Much of the above expansion and vitality is led by the Asia-Pacific region, where China accounts for over 40per cent of the regional traffic. Other regions, such as the Middle East, Latin America and Africa, are also seeing significant growth.

Hong Kong is benefiting from this global boom. Last year, our airport handled 53 million passengers, an increase of 34per cent year-on-year. In the first eight months of this year, we welcomed 40 million passengers, up another 15per cent. For 14 of the past 15 years, the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) has been the world's busiest cargo airport.

Today, our airport operates over 1 000 flights daily, connecting more than 210 destinations worldwide through some 140 airlines. To meet the rising demand, we are making substantial investments in our aviation infrastructure. The commissioning of the Three-Runway System last year was a major milestone. It enables our airport to handle up to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually by 2035.

Complementing this is the HKIA's ""SKYTOPIA"" development plan, which will transform our airport from an aviation hub into a world-leading landmark for commerce, tourism, arts and leisure. It is indeed a visionary project, featuring art storage facilities, a state-of-the-art sportainment complex, Hong Kong's largest yacht marina, and more.

Thanks to our international connectivity, Hong Kong also serves as the preferred gateway for international travel by residents in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). Currently, around 20per cent of our airport's passengers come from the GBA. With rising travel demand from this region, we see immense potential for this number to grow even further. To support this, we are enhancing the intermodal transport network in the GBA, and streamlining immigration and customs clearance procedures, to facilitate more efficient flows of passengers and cargo.

The world is changing rapidly, with geopolitics reshaping global economic dynamics and patterns of passenger travel.

  Notwithstanding this, China remains firmly committed to high-level two-way opening up, welcoming more international businesses and travellers. Its expanding unilateral visa exemption for more and more countries is a good case in point. Hong Kong’s role as a gateway to the Mainland will only grow stronger. As a matter of fact, in the first eight months of this year, travellers to Hong Kong from outside the Chinese Mainland reached 7.7 million, rising by 16per cent year-on-year.

In this connection, we are not only reinforcing ties with traditional partners in Europe and North America, but also expanding our network across the Global South, including ASEAN, the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America. We are actively working to introduce new destinations and increase flight frequencies with emerging markets, particularly for long-haul routes.

These efforts are already bearing fruit. Over the past two years, we have expanded bilateral air services agreements with more than 10 economies. In the past two months, we reached consensus with Chile and Poland respectively to work on new air services agreements that will further strengthen our connectivity with the economies in those regions.

Equally important is our commitment to sustainability. In the Policy Address delivered last week, we presented Hong Kong's vision in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). That includes developing the related industry chain in the GBA, the whole chain from upstream to downstream. This initiative will support our goal of achieving the targeted SAF consumption ratio for flights departing from the HKIA by 2030, and in becoming a leader in SAF in this region.

Ladies and gentlemen, events like Routes World provide an invaluable platform to build partnerships and foster collaboration. I invite you to make the most of the programmes and networking opportunities over the coming days.

My sincere thanks to Informa Markets and the Airport Authority Hong Kong for bringing this exceptional event to reality. Thank you all, and I wish you a productive and inspiring conference."

立法會一題：監察盛事活動的質素,2025-09-25 10:00,2025-09-25 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500408.htm,"以下是今日（九月二十五日）在立法會會議上田北辰議員的提問和文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩的答覆︰

問題：

據報早前於中環海濱舉行的熱氣球節活動，因未獲發相關牌照而未能安排熱氣球載客，引起市民不滿。有意見認為，事件令香港盛事之都的聲譽受損。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府表示相關部門在審批上述活動時，觀察到熱氣球運作曾出現難以穩定控制的情況，因此批出的牌照並不包括接載乘客，但其後主辦機構仍繼續以熱氣球載客活動為宣傳重點，就此政府會否採取跟進行動；

（二）據悉香港旅遊發展局網頁曾宣傳上述活動，令人誤以為該活動獲官方支持，該局在挑選活動作宣傳時的準則為何，以及會否監察有關活動的進度和質素，以避免活動出現問題時令政府尷尬；及

（三）鑑於有意見指出，過去兩年多個於政府場地舉辦的盛事活動均出現令人失望的安排，而政府於本年一月八日回覆本人的補充質詢時表示，將研究機制防止盛事活動令香港聲譽受損，至今有關工作的進展為何？

答覆：

主席：

就田北辰議員的提問，經諮詢商務及經濟發展局、發展局、民政及青年事務局及運輸及物流局後，現答覆如下：

就如行政長官早前提到，政府在推動盛事及活動在港舉行時，主要有三方面的角色，包括監管、推動和場地租賃。對於政府主辦、資助或支持的活動，政府都會全力監督，確保有關活動符合法例的要求，並妥善舉行。就政府沒有資助或參與籌辦的活動，我們樂見其成，尤其是新穎有趣，受市民及旅客歡迎的活動，政府會盡量提供便利和協助，亦會協助活動的宣傳。但有一點十分重要，就是所有活動主辦機構有責任確保活動安全及穩妥進行、須符合各項所需牌照及許可的要求。對於涉及安全風險和技術要求較高的活動，政府會嚴格監管，以安全為首，並會考慮同類型活動以往在香港舉行的情況，以及主辦機構以往舉辦同類型活動的經驗及往績。

在場地租賃的角色方面，就今次香港國際熱氣球節（熱氣球節）舉行的場地中環海濱活動空間而言，政府現時以短期租約批出活動空間給承租人，再由承租人租予外間機構組織活動，務求能善用市場的靈活及創意。舉辦的活動大部分均是租用團體與承租人之間的商業安排，由承租人在符合租約和法規後自行決定。

就問題三個部分，我回覆如下：

（一）熱氣球節是一項由私人機構舉辦的商業活動，而非政府主辦、資助或支持活動。主辦機構於今年四月通知有關政府部門已承租了中環海濱活動空間舉辦熱氣球節，並希望部門能就活動所需牌照的申請事宜提供協助。主辦機構於七月八日向相關部門申請活動所需牌照（註）。過程中，相關部門與主辦機構保持緊密溝通，積極提供協助及專業意見。然而，鑑於主辦機構在八月二十日進行實地熱氣球測試的效果未如理想，安全風險顯著，相關部門經審慎並全面考慮公眾安全的情況下，於八月二十七日與主辦機構會面時通知他們，只可以在他們成功進行實地熱氣球測試後，相關部門才會考慮批准在活動中展示熱氣球的所需牌照。至於在載客熱氣球方面，由於主辦機構表示只能於活動前一至兩天再次進行測試，部門在會上清晰向主辦機構表示，由於時間倉猝，載客熱氣球的成功審批機會微乎其微，建議主辦機構盡早向外公布取消載客熱氣球的項目，並為已購票人士安排退款或作其他補償。主辦機構最後於九月三日（即活動舉辦前一天）進行另一次測試。政府相關部門經審慎並全面考慮公眾的安全情況下，於九月四日批准熱氣球在活動中展示。

消費者委員會（消委會）和香港海關（海關）在接獲有關熱氣球節的投訴後，一直密切跟進相關投訴。消委會在事件發生後已即時呼籲主辦機構考慮向受影響人士退款，並提醒持票人士應保留門票、收據等，若日後需要追討，亦可保障自身權益。消委會在得悉主辦機構宣布退款賠償方案後，已促請主辦機構加派人手，盡快處理電話查詢、與已提出退款申請的持票人士進行確認以及於承諾的限期前安排退款。消委會正繼續與主辦機構保持聯絡，跟進已接獲的投訴個案。此外，海關亦正就已接獲的舉報作出跟進。如發現有違反《商品說明條例》的情況，海關將會採取適當執法行動。

（二）香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）支持盛事活動及評估對活動的支持程度時，會考慮和平衡不同因素，包括活動能否吸引市民和旅客參與；能否在全球營造正面曝光，展示香港在文化藝術、體育等方面的獨特魅力；以及能否展示香港的策略性地位等。

為配合政府推動旅遊的工作，除了旅發局舉辦或支持的活動外，旅發局近年亦在Discover Hong Kong網站介紹政府的大型活動，以及其他機構自行舉辦的大型活動，並作出持續更新，方便旅客和市民一站式閱覽城中最新的活動資訊和規劃行程。然而，旅發局無法保證由私人機構舉辦的活動的質素。經過今次事件後，旅發局將會在網站加上清晰的活動分項或備註，令大眾能知悉活動的舉辦單位。當活動出現問題時，旅發局會就其所知作出適時的活動更新，包括立即於網站抽起有關活動。

（三）我於一月八日的立法會會議回答田議員提問時指出，我們會不斷檢視政府資助活動的合約條款，以確保資助物有所值，活動能為香港帶來增值，更加絕對不可令香港聲譽受損。事實上，我們早前已經完成檢視「M」品牌大型體育盛事和文化藝術盛事基金，並公布了加強審批機制和後續監察的措施，目標正是更精準地為吸引旅客參與的盛事提供財政支援。

至於熱氣球節的場地，即中環海濱活動空間的用地，現時租約於二○二六年六月完結，發展局正準備於今年第四季為短期租約重新招標。發展局會因應歷年的經驗，優化租約條款，既善用土地引入多元活動，亦從風險角度強化場地管理安排，包括強化租約承租人把關角色，以及加強預警通報機制，讓發展局需要時適當介入。

註：包括由民航處發出的「不定期航班服務許可證」，以及食物環境衞生署發出的「臨時公眾娛樂場所牌照」。"
LCQ1: Monitoring the quality of mega events,2025-09-25 10:00,2025-09-25 10:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/25/P2025092500414.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Michael Tien and a reply by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, in the Legislative Council today (September 25):

Question:

It has been reported that the hot air balloon festival held earlier on at the Central Harbourfront failed to arrange for hot air balloons to carry passengers because the relevant licences had not been granted, resulting in public dissatisfaction. There are views that the incident has damaged Hong Kong's reputation as an events capital. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as the Government has indicated that, when vetting and approving the aforesaid event, the relevant departments observed that there were instances where hot air balloons were difficult to control, and therefore the licence granted did not include the carriage of passengers, but the organiser continued to use the hot air balloon passenger activities as the focus of its publicity subsequently, whether the Government will take follow-up actions in this regard;

(2) as it is learnt that the aforesaid activity was publicised on the Hong Kong Tourism Board's website, creating the false impression that it was officially endorsed, of the criteria adopted by the Board for selecting activities for publicity, and whether it will monitor the progress and quality of the activities concerned, in order to avoid embarrassing the Government when problems with the activities arise; and

(3) as there are views pointing out that many mega events held at government venues in the past two years have made disappointing arrangements, and the Government indicated in its reply to my supplementary question on January 8 this year that it would study a mechanism to prevent mega events from damaging Hong Kong's reputation, of the progress of the relevant work so far?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau and the Transport and Logistics Bureau, our reply to the question raised by the Hon Michael Tien is as follows:

As the Chief Executive mentioned earlier, the Government plays three key roles, including regulating, promoting and venue renting, in the promotion of mega events and activities in Hong Kong. For events organised, funded or supported by the Government, the Government will do its utmost to ensure that the events comply with the legal requirement and are held properly. We also welcome events that the Government does not fund or participate in organising, especially novel and interesting events that are popular among the public and visitors. The Government will endeavour to facilitate and provide assistance, and will also help promote the events. However, it is crucial that all event organisers bear the responsibility to ensure the safe and orderly execution of their activities, and the strict compliance with all necessary license and permit requirements. For events involving high safety risks and technical requirements, the Government will strictly monitor them by prioritising safety and taking into account similar events held in Hong Kong and the organisers' experience and track record in hosting similar events in the past.

Regarding the role of venue rental, the Government currently leases the Central Harbourfront Event Space, the venue for the Hong Kong International Hot Air Balloon Festival (the Festival), to a tenant on a short-term basis. The tenant then rents the space to external organisations for hosting events, leveraging market flexibility and creativity. The majority of events held are commercial arrangements between the hiring organisation and the tenant, with the tenant making its own decisions, subject to compliance with the lease agreement and regulations.

My response to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) The Festival was a commercial event organised by a private entity and was not organised, funded or supported by the Government. In April this year, the organiser notified the relevant Government departments that it had leased the Central Harbourfront Event Space for the Festival and sought assistance in applying for the necessary permits. On July 8, the organiser applied for the necessary licenses (Note) from the relevant departments. Throughout the process, the relevant departments maintained close communication with the organiser, actively providing assistance and professional advice. However, in consideration that the results of the organiser's on-site hot air balloon demonstration on August 20 were unsatisfactory and the safety risks were significant, the relevant departments, after cautious and comprehensive consideration of public safety, informed the organiser during a meeting on August 27 that, only after an on-site hot air balloon demonstration could be successfully conducted would the relevant departments consider issuing the necessary licenses to display hot air balloons at the Festival. Regarding hot air balloons for carrying passengers, as the organiser stated that it could only conduct another demonstration one to two days before the Festival, the relevant departments clearly stated to the organiser at the meeting that, due to the tight time schedule, the chance of granting approval was extremely slim, and recommended the organiser to publicly announce the cancellation of the carrying passengers part as soon as possible and arrange refunds or other compensation for those who had already purchased the tickets. The organiser eventually conducted another demonstration on September 3, the day before the Festival. After cautious and comprehensive consideration of public safety, the relevant departments approved the display of hot air balloons at the Festival on September 4.

Upon receipt of the complaints relating to the Festival, the Consumer Council and the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) have been closely following up. Shortly after the incident, the Consumer Council urged the organiser to consider offering refunds to affected persons, and reminded ticketholders to retain the tickets and receipts for protecting their rights and interests in case of future claims. After the organiser announced a refund plan, the Consumer Council has called on the organiser to deploy additional staff to expedite the handling of telephone enquiries, confirm with the ticketholders who have submitted the claims and make refund arrangement before the promised deadline. The Consumer Council continues to maintain contact with the organiser and is following up on the complaints. Furthermore, the C&ED is also following up on the reports received. The C&ED will take appropriate enforcement action in case there are violations of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance.

(2) The Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) considers and balances various factors when assessing the level of support for mega events, including whether the events can attract participation from the public and visitors; whether they can create positive global exposure and showcase Hong Kong's unique charm in culture, arts, sports and other areas; and whether they can demonstrate Hong Kong's strategic position.

To support the efforts on tourism promotion, in addition to events organised or supported by the HKTB, the HKTB has also been featuring major events organised by the Government and large-scale events organised by other organisations on the Discover Hong Kong website in recent years. This website is continuously updated, providing public and visitors with a one-stop access to the latest event information and itinerary planning. However, the HKTB cannot guarantee the quality of events organised by private entities. Following this incident, the HKTB will introduce clear event categorisation or annotations on its website so that the public will know who the event organiser is. If there are any issues arising from an event, the HKTB will provide timely updates to its website based on available information, including removing the events from the website in the first instance.

(3) In response to the question from the Hon Tien at the Legislative Council meeting on January 8, I stated that we would continuously review the terms of Government funded events to ensure that the funding provided was value for money, added value to Hong Kong, and did not damage Hong Kong's reputation. In fact, we had already completed the review on the ""M"" Mark Major Sports Events and the Mega Arts and Cultural Events Fund, and announced measures to strengthen the vetting mechanism and subsequent monitoring, and provide more targeted financial support for events that attract tourist participation.

âAs for the venue for the Festival, the Central Harbourfront Event Space, the current tenancy will be terminated in June 2026. The Development Bureau is preparing to launch re-tendering of the short-term tenancy in the fourth quarter of this year. Based on the experience over the years, the Development Bureau will enhance the relevant tenancy terms so as to make good use of the site for activities of different kinds, while strengthening management of the venue from the perspective of risk management by, say, imposing a stronger gatekeeping role on the tenant, and putting in place an early alert and notification mechanism for timely and appropriate intervention by the Development Bureau.

Note: These include the ""Non-scheduled Service Permit"" issued by the Civil Aviation Department and the ""Temporary Places of Public Entertainment Licence"" issued by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department."

基於第七屆立法會會期將於二零二五年十月二十四日中止，因此《政府帳目審計報告書》和《審計署署長第八十五號報告書──衡工量值式審計結果》無法按正常程序，於二零二五年十月提交立法會主席，以及於二零二五年十一月提交立法會省覽。鑑於有關情況，審計署與立法會主席、政府帳目委員會和財經事務及庫務局達成協議，即（a）已把提交《政府帳目審計報告書》予立法會主席，以及提交該報告書供立法會省覽的日期分別提前到二零二五年九月十二日和九月二十五日（於二零二四年分別為十月三十一日和十一月二十七日）；並（b）將把提交《審計署署長第八十五號報告書──衡工量值式審計結果》的日期延至下屆立法會會期內及不遲於二零二六年四月七日（該日期亦為提交《審計署署長第八十六號報告書──衡工量值式審計結果》的限期）。有關押後提交報告書一事，已按於一九九八年二月十一日提交臨時立法會的衡工量值式審計工作準則，向行政長官取得批准。"

  The Report on Government Accounts provides an overall assurance that the financial statements properly present the assets and liabilities of the Government as at March 31, 2025, and the receipts and payments for the year ended on that date.

  The Report on Government Accounts is available on the Audit Commission's website (www.aud.gov.hk/eng/pubpr/pubpr_accounts.htm).

  In light of the prorogation of the seventh LegCo on October 24, 2025, the normal procedures for submitting the Report on Government Accounts and Report No. 85 of the Director of Audit on the results of value for money audits to the President of LegCo in October 2025 and tabling the Reports in November 2025 cannot be adopted. In consideration of the circumstances, the Audit Commission, with the agreement of the President of LegCo, the Public Accounts Committee and the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau, (a) has advanced the submission and tabling of the Report on Government Accounts to September 12 and September 25 respectively in 2025 (in 2024 the dates were October 31 and November 27 respectively) and (b) will defer the submission of Report No. 85 of the Director of Audit on the results of value for money audits to the next term of LegCo and no later than April 7, 2026 (i.e. the deadline for submission of Report No. 86 of the Director of Audit on the results of value for money audits). In accordance with the value for money audit guidelines tabled in the Provisional LegCo on February 11, 1998, approval of the Chief Executive has been obtained for the deferral. "

As Ragasa gradually moved away from Hong Kong later this morning, various government departments, while prioritising safety, promptly initiated comprehensive recovery efforts to restore normalcy as quickly as possible.

Mr Chan visited this afternoon (September 24) a site in the Central and Western District affected by fallen trees and a landslide to inspect the clean-up and recovery progress by departments such as the Fire Services Department (FSD), the Highways Department (HyD), and the Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO). He then chaired a meeting of the steering committee on handling extreme weather to receive updates from the heads of relevant bureaux and departments and comprehensively review emergency response and recovery efforts of various government departments.

Government departments are mobilising all necessary manpower and resources to expedite clearing obstacles from major roads and bus routes. According to current clean-up assessments by relevant departments, major roads and public transport are expected to reopen when the Hong Kong Observatory issues the Strong Wind Signal No. 3, allowing the city to resume normalcy.

The Emergency Monitoring and Support Centre under the Security Bureau was fully activated more than 24 hours before the Hong Kong Observatory issued the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal, ensuring the best priorities for emergency decision-making, striving to minimise the impact of the adverse weather on the public.

The Development Bureau (DEVB) is maintaining close liaison with various works departments and the Buildings Department (BD) to deploy resources of contractors to expedite the progress of the recovery work.

*Regarding flooding, 19 flooding cases have been confirmed as of 5pm today. With the efforts of the Drainage Services Department (DSD)'s emergency response teams and the assistance of the mobile powerful pumping robots, 14 cases have been resolved. The DSD is currently addressing the remaining five flooding cases and is confident of resolving them within one to two hours. The DSD conducted analysis and made deployment in advance before the onset of the super typhoon and was equipped with mobile powerful pumping robots on standby, contributing to the swift handling of possible flooding cases during the passage of the super typhoon in Hong Kong. Once all flooding cases have been resolved, the DSD will conduct inspections and carry out clearance at about 240 flood-prone locations. Additionally, the DSD will examine the drainage conditions of 80 major rivers and drainage channels to ensure their smooth operation.

*Regarding the safety of structures, the Emergency Control Centre of the BD has received a total of 25 emergency reports related to signboards and scaffoldings at construction sites, 22 of which have been resolved. The BD proactively inspected construction sites next to major roads in advance to reduce incidents caused by the super typhoon as much as possible. After the typhoon, the BD has also launched special patrols to identify potential dangers arising from loosened or damaged signboards, scaffoldings, windows and appendages along major roads and in high-risk buildings in various districts.

*Regarding landslides, as of 5pm, the GEO received a total of four reports of landslides in Sai Ying Pun, Tuen Mun, Stanley and Chung Pui. Two incidents involved slope and retaining wall failures caused by fallen trees. The GEO has arranged for geotechnical engineers to assist relevant departments for follow-up work. The Emergency Control Centre of the GEO will remain in operation to handle reports of landslide incidents received until the threat is lifted.

*Regarding fallen trees, various relevant departments will expedite the handling of them. To enhance efficiency, the DEVB earlier identified some 50 plots of government land in various districts for the departments' temporary storage of fallen trees and debris in nearby areas before sending them to landfills for disposal. After the passage of the typhoon, tree management departments will inspect trees in areas with high pedestrian and vehicular flow and take appropriate measures, including stabilising trees, removing dangling broken branches, and removing fallen or unstable trees. In case of blockage of rural roads caused by fallen trees, members of the public may seek assistance through the 1823 Mobile App, by calling 1823 or sending an email to tellme@1823.gov.hk. Cases will be referred to relevant departments for follow-up as appropriate

In addition, after typhoons and rainstorms, trees, slopes and the structures may also be affected due to a large intake of water into soil and surface layers. Members of the public should therefore remain vigilant when going outdoors and avoid prolonged stays under trees, slopes and structures with signs of concrete spalling.

The FSD, by 5pm today, handled a total of 143 reports of people trapped in lifts, 454 reports from automatic fire alarm systems, 393 reports of fallen trees and two reports of landslides. Assistance was provided to 61 people to safe places in 16 flooding incidents. The FSD has co-ordinated with various departments, including the HyD and the Transport Department (TD), for rapid clearing of fallen trees blocking major roads, ensuring the smooth flow of main roads and rescue routes remain unobstructed. Relevant work will be carried out overnight.

The Emergency Transport Coordination Centre (ETCC) of the TD has escalated its operational level and has been operating round the clock throughout the typhoon. It closely monitored traffic and transport conditions on major routes, including trunk roads, tunnels and bridges across the territory. The ETCC expedited assessment of the typhoon's impact on traffic with relevant departments and public transport operators, and steered operators to conduct site checks along their routes to ensure safe operations before gradually resuming normal services, such as railway and franchised buses. In addition, the TD conducted ongoing review of situations at various trunk roads and link roads at locations without alternative routes. This helped the prompt identification of locations affected by flooding or obstructed by objects requiring higher priority of clearance and co-ordination of clearance work of departments concerned, with a view to reopening blocked roads and fully resuming public transport services early.

The Emergency Control Centres of the HyD were activated on the morning of September 22. Officers of the HyD, together with road maintenance contractors, have been closely monitoring the latest conditions of major public roads in real time and responding promptly to emergencies caused by the inclement weather. As of 5pm, the department received approximately 1 620 reports of road incidents, including around 1 050 cases of fallen trees, around 85 cases of flooding and six reports of landslides. The department commenced patrolling major roads at 1.20pm, and the work has already been completed. Nearly 200 emergency response teams under the department also stand ready for deployment. The teams have been mobilised to remove fallen trees and obstructions on roads, to clear debris-clogged roadside drains and channels, as well as to carry out emergency cordoning-off and urgent repair works for collapsed slopes under safe conditions. The HyD will continue to make every effort to clear the remaining fallen trees and other road obstructions to restore normal traffic as soon as possible after the typhoon. In addition, the 16 pedestrian subways along Shing Mun River in Sha Tin, Lam Tsuen River and Tai Po River in Tai Po, which were temporarily closed last night due to inclement weather and storm surge, have been reopened starting from 5pm.

In view of the possible threats that Ragasa may pose to Hong Kong, the Home Affairs Department (HAD) and District Offices (DOs) had initiated relevant response measures in advance. They have co-ordinated with relevant departments and organisations to enhance preparedness, setting up sandbags and water-stop boards, among others. District Council (DC) members, members of ""the three committees"" and Care Teams were mobilised to disseminate the latest weather information to residents in flood-prone areas, reminding them to make necessary preparations. Residents in flood-prone areas were advised to stay away from their homes or stay at temporary shelters. All DOs opened temporary shelters in advance at 8am yesterday. During the tropical cyclone, a total of 50 temporary shelters were in operation with a total of about 900 residents, which is more than before. In addition, the HAD also activated a round-the-clock hotline in advance at noon on September 22 for public enquiries on the tropical cyclone and released information on the operation of temporary shelters through different channels continuously. The HAD's Emergency Co-ordination Centre began operation in the afternoon on the same day to co-ordinate work and information dissemination in 18 districts as well as promptly follow up on various incident reports.

After the typhoon, DOs will continue to co-ordinate support from other departments and organisations, and mobilise DC members, members of ""the three committees"", and Care Teams to provide appropriate assistance. This includes helping affected households, particularly households of singleton and doubleton elderly persons affected by severe flooding, remove stagnant water and restore their homes. As the weather in Hong Kong remains unstable, the temporary shelters under the HAD will continue to open during the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 to serve citizens in need until the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 is cancelled. In addition, DOs will co-ordinate with relevant departments and organisations to carry out relief work in their districts, enabling the community to resume normalcy as soon as possible to facilitate citizens' commuting to work or school.

To support government departments and the waste transfer sector in rapidly handling fallen trees and waste to restore normalcy as quickly as possible, the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has been maintaining close communication with the industry during the past few days and implemented multiple measures. These include reserving sufficient temporary storage areas at the three landfills and Y·PARK for collecting and storing fallen tree waste, as well as preparing emergency sawing and wood-chipping equipment to facilitate rapid clean-up. Recyclable tree waste will be sorted out and sent to Y·PARK for recycling and reuse. Additionally, the EPD has allocated in advance manpower and machinery to ensure sufficient capacity at refuse transfer stations (RTS) and extended the operating hours of urban RTSs and the three landfills from today to September 26. Recovery works are now in full swing at the Island East Transfer Station which was affected by storm surge during the typhoon, with a view to resuming service at the soonest practicable time. The EPD will keep a close tab on the operation of waste handling facilities and flexibly redeploy resources to facilitate a swift return to normalcy.

In advance of the typhoon's approach, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has conducted inspections and cleaning of roadside gullies at flooding blackspots to minimise the risk of blockage caused by refuse and fallen leaves. The FEHD has also secured or removed some facilities such as litter containers placed in open areas, and has reminded operators of on-street hawker stalls to implement appropriate typhoon precautionary measures. Following the passage of the typhoon, the FEHD will resume street cleaning and refuse collection services as soon as possible, including deploying departmental and contractor cleaning staff to expedite the removal of refuse from major thoroughfares.

After the wind subsided, staff members of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) immediately inspected country parks for damage to facilities, fallen trees and road blockages. The AFCD also cleared fallen trees and arranged for repairs of damaged facilities to expedite the reopening of affected facilities for public use. As weather conditions remain unstable, there are still risks of flash floods, flooding, tree falls, and landslides in rural areas. The AFCD urges members of the public to refrain from outdoor activities.

During the typhoon, frontline police officers remained steadfast in carrying out their duties, taking appropriate actions based on the situation. These included urging the public to stay away from shorelines and flood-prone areas, deploying personnel to handle high-risk areas such as unstable scaffolding and precarious windows, and evacuating residents from affected areas. Officers also closely monitored traffic conditions and eased the traffic by assisting vehicles trapped by flooding or blocked by fallen trees and other obstacles. Fallen trees and other debris on roads were promptly cleared to reopen blocked roads as soon as possible.

The Housing Department (HD) Communication Centre was activated before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 was hoisted to get fully prepared in handling emergencies. During the passage of the tropical cyclone, frontline staff of the HD remained dedicated to delivering their duties and took all necessary precautionary measures. In addition, the emergency response team of the HD's construction sites stepped up vigilance and maintained close contact and collaboration with relevant government departments to promptly respond to possible emergency situations during the typhoon. They also worked with project teams and contractors to clear debris from nearby drainage outlets to effectively reduce the accumulation of muddy water on the roads in the vicinity and swiftly remove the water barriers misplaced by the strong wind to minimise traffic disruption.

The steering committee on handling extreme weather reminds the public that although the storm gradually moved away, the weather in Hong Kong remains unstable, and the public should continue to stay updated with the latest government announcements. The committee emphasises that staff from various government departments will continue to fulfil their duties, working together with various sectors to fully engage in community recovery efforts and provide appropriate support to those in need. Departmental personnel will continue to carry out relief work with contractors, enabling members of the public to resume a normal life as soon as possible."

僱主應與僱員訂立熱帶氣旋或暴雨後合理的工作安排,2025-09-24 20:21,2025-09-24 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092401156.htm,"勞工處今日（九月二十四日）提醒僱主應在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告信號取消後為僱員提供合理而切實可行的工作安排，並考慮路面、交通及其他情況，彈性處理僱員復工或遙距工作的安排（如適用）。這有助維持良好的勞資關係，並確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢。

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"
Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-09-24 20:21,2025-09-24 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/24/P2025092401155.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (September 24) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.
  
  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
