CHP recorded another locally acquired case of chikungunya fever,2025-12-06 20:05,2025-12-06 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120600629.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 6), the CHP has recorded one new local case of chikungunya fever (CF). The CHP is collaborating with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) to implement appropriate prevention and control measures to minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Latest case information
------------------------------

  The case involves a 67-year-old female living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she developed joint pain and a fever on December 2 and 3 respectively, followed by rash yesterday (December 5) and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital on the same day. She was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing.

  The preliminary investigation also revealed that the patient had no travel history during the incubation period. The case is classified as local. She hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails with a household contact on November 29. Other than that, the CHP found no overlap between her activities during the incubation period and the locations visited by earlier confirmed cases. The CHP considered that the patient likely contracted the infection while hiking near Tsing Yi Nature Trails on that day, and that there is an epidemiological linkage between this case and the recent local cases in Tsing Yi. Her household contacts (including the hiking companion) are currently asymptomatic. The CHP has implemented prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, including providing medical surveillance and health advice to the household contacts concerned. If necessary, the CHP will arrange for laboratory testing. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 78 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 10 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------------

As some confirmed CF cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considered the trails to be a higher-risk area. The CHP continued to urge individuals who have recently visited the Tsing Yi North area or hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which was set up earlier. The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. In late November, the CHP also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department and Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Meanwhile, regarding the recently announced local case involving a23-year-old female living in Sheung Wan, the epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The CHP continued to urge the members of the public residing and working at Queen's Road West (near Morrison Street and Hollywood Road) who experienced a fever, rash or joint pain on or after November 15 to seek medical advice or contact the CHP immediately. CHP officers continued to reach out to individuals in the aforementioned locations to remind individuals to be aware of relevant symptoms and to maintain good environmental hygiene in their households.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for over 2 700 individuals residing or working in the district through the health consultation booth at the main entrance of the Sheung Wan Civic Centre, its enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), questionnaire surveys and door-to-door visits. No new symptomatic persons have been identified in the past one day. Two individuals with mild symptoms previously have been arranged to undergo blood tests. One of them tested negative for the chikungunya virus, and the result for the other individual is pending. Given the significant decrease in the number of citizens visiting the health consultation booth recently, the operating hours of the booth will be adjusted starting tomorrow (December 7) based on actual needs. Please refer to the CHP's webpage for the actual operating hours of the health consultation booth.

Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生防護中心再錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案,2025-12-06 19:45,2025-12-06 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120600571.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月六日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱本地個案。中心正聯同食物環境衞生署（食環署）採取適當防控措施，以減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

最新個案資料
——————

個案涉及一名67歲女子，住所位於葵青區。初步調查顯示，她於十二月二日及三日分別出現關節痛及發燒，昨日（十二月五日）出現皮疹，同日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。

初步調查顯示，病人在潛伏期內不曾外遊，屬本地感染個案。她曾於十一月二十九日與一名家居接觸者到青衣自然徑行山。除此以外，中心未發現她在潛伏期內的其他活動地點與早前確診個案曾到訪的地點有重疊。中心認為，病人較大機會於當日在青衣自然徑一帶行山時受到感染，與近期青衣的本地個案有流行病學關連。她的家居接觸者（包括一名一同行山人士），暫時沒有出現病徵。中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為相關家居接觸者提供醫學監察及健康建議。如有需要，中心會安排化驗檢測。流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

本港今年累計錄得78宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，10宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

鑑於近期部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。中心繼續呼籲近期曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電早前設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。熱線會繼續由上午九時至下午八時運作。中心在上月底亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

特別針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食環署持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾、以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持分者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

另外，就日前公布的一宗本地個案（涉及一名居於上環的23歲女子），流行病學調查仍然繼續進行。

中心繼續呼籲在上環皇后大道西（近摩利臣街和荷李活道一帶）居住或上班的市民，如於十一月十五日或之後出現發燒、皮疹或關節痛，應盡快求醫或聯絡中心。中心人員會繼續接觸上述地點的市民，提醒他們留意有否相關病徵和注意家居環境衞生。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於上環文娛中心正門入口處設立醫護站、熱線電話（電話：2125 2373）、問卷及於上述受影響地區進行上門探訪，為逾2 700名在當區工作或居住的市民進行評估，而過去一日未有再發現新增出現病徵人士。中心已為兩名早前出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，其中一人的樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性，另一人的樣本正等候結果。鑑於近日前往醫護站的市民明顯減少，明日（十二月七日）起，醫護站的運作時間會因應實際需要而調整，確實時間請參閱中心網站。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

​
​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑以有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及

在此房屋局希望再次澄清一些誤解，就是一直有媒體報道提及受大火影響的災民在入住過渡性房屋後，只有數個月的免租期，然後便需繳付租金。房屋局發言人指出，有關言論並非事實。

發言人重申，考慮到受火災影響居民非常緊急的情況，房屋局早已作出特別安排，對入住過渡性房屋或其他上述項目的受影響居民提供住宿援助，租金全免。換句話說，如有需要，受影響的居民可以較長期入住。政府會在住宿方面一直支援受影響居民，有需要的居民無需擔心相關租金開支或居住期。

受火災影響的市民如欲入住房屋局的過渡性房屋，可致電3611 8482查詢；如欲入住房協的專用安置屋邨、暫租住屋項目或出租屋邨空置單位，可致電2839 1393查詢；如市民就房屋署的中轉屋或臨時收容中心有任何查詢，則可致電2658 4430。"

The interim housing and transit centres of the HD are also being actively prepared.

  The Housing Bureau would like to clarify some misunderstandings once again. Media reports have consistently stated that victims affected by the fire incident only have a few months of rent-free period after moving into transitional housing before they are required to pay rent. The spokesman of the Housing Bureau pointed out that such statements are false.

  The spokesman reiterates that, in consideration of the extremely emergency situation of the residents affected by the fire incident, special arrangements have already been made earlier by the Housing Bureau to provide accommodation support to those affected residents moving into transitional housing or other above-mentioned projects. The affected residents may stay with full rent exemptions. In other words, if needed, the affected residents can stay for a longer period of time. The Government will continue to support the affected residents in terms of accommodation, and the residents in need do not have to worry about the relevant rental expenses or the duration of their stay.

  Affected residents who would like to stay in the transitional housing under the Housing Bureau may call 3611 8482. Affected residents who would like to stay in the units in dedicated rehousing estates flats, ""T-Home"" projects and rental estates under the HKHS may call 2839 1393 for enquiries.

民政及青年事務局局長、勞工及福利局局長就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒答問內容,2025-12-06 12:03,2025-12-06 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120600278.htm,"民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十二月六日）上午出席電台節目後，就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的答問內容：

記者：首先想問局長現在仍有受災居民指沒有「一戶一社工」聯絡他們，亦有社工反映政府給的指示不是很清楚，他們都是看新聞才知道自己要做什麼，或者資訊如何安排，這方面你們如何跟社工溝通，有沒有做得不足的地方？

勞工及福利局局長：「一戶一社工」基本上社會福利署（社署）約2 000名社工其實是全體出動的，差不多社署每一位註冊社工都會協助一個家庭，大家都知道宏福苑應該有1 984戶，所以每戶都會有一個社工，「一戶一社工」、一社工一戶，是這樣做配對的。截至昨日（十二月五日）下午四時，已經有約1 900戶登記了，絶大多數社工已聯絡他們。現在的做法是每天社工最少會打兩個電話給他們，早上和下午各一個，現時接通率大概為八成五，住戶會接電話，有時候可能剛走開了未有接聽或當刻不想接電話，這不要緊，但我認為溝通是順暢了，陸續社工會作探訪，跟他們傾談，拿八達通卡給他們，可以通過這個方法讓大家可以更密切，認識更多、了解更清楚。

公務員方面，現時做法是一個社工會編配兩至三名公務員，因為這是公務員的動員，陸陸續續在起動。社工同事其實本身有專業的培訓，但在大火災發生的初期資訊很多，有些資訊是要通過內部發放途徑讓他們知道。有時居民問的東西林林總總，未必純粹是問政府資訊，每一個家庭面對的問題都不同，社工要想盡辦法，他們未必懂得所有資訊，我們的想法是當居民在徬徨之際，先打電話給社工，社工收到後再去想想這些問題應找那個部門、處所協助，我聽到的是，包括剛剛我有說到譬如婆婆要回到宏志閣，但她不能走動又剛做完手術，她想親友陪同，社工就幫她找警察，警方同意了讓兩名親友陪她。有些會打來問住的問題，譬如可否幫忙找一間酒店暫住，又或者有其他需要，社工都會盡量幫助轉介。

現時我掌握的是，截至現時「一戶一社工」基本上運行順暢，因為社工們已接觸和致電住戶，如果仍然有極少數住戶未登記，最理想就請他致電182 183，原本182 183是24小時有人接聽的照顧者專線，但是我們和東華三院談好了，182 183會處理大火災下受影響居民，如果打182 183留下其聯絡方法，我們已配對的社工會去聯絡，希望盡快所有住戶全數登記，現在只差很少而已，只有數十戶尚未登記。

記者：麥局長，想問問援助基金現在達到30億元，其實居民的需要是中長線住屋問題，假如他們可能不想搬到現時的中轉屋或過渡屋，想自己出去租住單位的話，這個基金有沒有甚麼限制？譬如可不可以申請用來交租？甚至將來有意願重建的話，又可不可以用這些基金的錢去幫他們做這些事？另外，棚網方面，因為知道你們和發展局推出了支援計劃，其實區議員現在接觸了多少法團？他們最主要的憂慮是甚麼？如果真的限期屆滿，即今日需要拆網，有沒有一些大廈可能處理不了這個問題？會怎樣寬容一點去處理這件事？

民政及青年事務局局長：支援基金（「大埔宏福苑援助基金」）方面，得到各界對宏福苑的關心，支援基金截至昨日下午，外界的捐款已籌得27億元，加上政府撥款的三億元起始基金，現時整個基金有30億元。30億元當中，過去幾天我們都推出了不同的支援計劃，包括應急錢（一萬元應急補助金）、生活津貼，還有給外傭、學生和工友等的補助金，處理不同群體在這個時候的特別需要。大家知道我們將生活津貼的金額由本來的五萬元，在十二月四日開始增加到十萬元。這是因為我們接觸了受影響住戶，了解到他們的需要，我們便會為不同群組推出計劃以符合他們的需要，包括剛才你提到的中期住屋需要，又或是日後長期的住屋方案。我們會在適當時候，按居民的需要和意願，推出不同計劃去解決。所以我們多次強調整個過程，當居民由火警發生到重建家園會是一個很長的過程，支援基金會為他們提供一些長期和持續的支援。政府也會陪伴各位受影響居民，走這段比較有挑戰的路。政府希望透過好好地運用支援基金，來解決居民中期或長期的住屋需要，或他們生活的需要。

至於棚網方面，昨日我們和發展局通知了大家，我們很明白，現時棚網要下架，也有一些法團正進行大維修工程，可能都牽涉到這次火災事故的顧問公司和工程公司。我們明白很多業主會很忐忑，究竟會不會因為這樣而令自己屋苑的大維修工程會「爛尾」、拖延或如何收拾？所以我們和發展局昨日宣布，會透過十八區的區議員接觸不同的法團，發展局也會聯絡和統整一些專業團體的力量，包括香港測量師學會和一些法定機構，由專業人士為法團提供專業支援。譬如如果他們真的要重新選擇一間顧問公司或工程公司，要重新招標，那程序是怎樣？應該怎樣去選擇？要求應該是怎樣？我們會向他們提供協助，而物監局（物業管理業監管局）亦已通知全港的物管公司，他們也要盡公司的責任，好好協助法團管理和處理這些工程。

記者：剛剛說到其實「一戶一社工」接觸率也很大，在節目中也提到未來每戶會配備兩至三個公務員「跑腿」，想知道現在計劃進程，大概何時會見到公務員開始投入服務？另外坊間有聲音說要全面落實所有地盤禁煙，現在進展怎樣、有沒有遇到困難或者目前計劃是怎樣的？最後想問問，剛才麥局長提到整個過程會很漫長，短期支援和長期支援大概會預留多少錢？始終現在30億都很多，有沒有說大概短期支援會花多少錢？後來的計劃又是怎樣？會預留多少百分比的資金供長期支援？

勞工及福利局局長：「一戶一社工」下同一時間每名社工每一戶都配對兩至三名公務員，這是公務員動員的其中一部分，陸續我們開始行動，「跑腿」是我說的其中一個比較通俗的說法，主要考慮到在宏福苑有很多老人家，譬如入住過渡屋可能比較遠，如他們有特別需要，同事可以幫他拿物資，甚至可以想像接下來除了政府的財政支援外，不少慈善團體表示會有財政支援，兩種形式都有，有些是金錢，可能老人家想拿支票或者需要幫忙，我們請同事送上去，就不用老人家奔走。另外如果是實物，假設有這樣的支援，我們又可以送過去，這是想像中可能出現的情況，但實則上在支援過程中應該有出現很多情景需要別人幫忙，我覺得同事很樂意的，可以減輕他們的壓力，這些我們會做好的。

地盤禁煙方面，現行的法例下，勞工處處長如發現有易燃的物體，或者有懷疑而找到證據的，認為該處有火災風險，處長可針對每一個地盤逐個禁煙，這個做法是逐個地盤去做的，而且處長是需要證明該處是有火災風險的。

但現時我聽到較強烈的呼聲，指是否應該要有全面的要求把所有地盤皆定為禁煙區，這個做法和現有的法例寫法完全不同，但我聽得很清晰社會上有很強的呼聲，所以當立法會在一月一日正式運作後，我們第一時間會跟立法會商討，如果立法會議員認同社會上這種呼聲我們就去修例，但在還未修例之前，處長沒有權說所有地盤都要禁煙，現時只可以逐個去看。現在我們已在進行，是逐個地盤看，一有風險就要禁煙。所以如果這個呼聲這麼強烈的話，我們跟立法會商討後若大家都認為要這樣做，我們就修例。

民政及青年事務局局長：正如我們剛才多次強調，政府會陪伴所有受影響住戶走這段路程，讓他們可以逐步恢復正常生活，重建家園。而支援基金的款項亦會按居民在不同時期的需要，包括現在一定是短期的迫切需要，解決他們燃眉之急，中期的時候，包括他們的住屋需要和生活需要。然後到長期，大家會想怎樣可以重建家園？這亦是我們在整個過程聽到居民的需要和意願，我們便會推出不同計劃，好好善用這支援基金，令到居民短、中、長期的需要，無論是生活需要或是住宿需要都會得到照顧。

Remarks by SHYA and SLW at media session regarding follow-up work on fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po,2025-12-06 11:57,2025-12-06 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120600268.htm,"âThe Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, and the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (December 6) regarding the follow-up work on the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, after attending a radio programme. Following are their remarks at the media session:

Reporter: Miss Mak, right now the funds are being used for immediate relief. How does the Government plan to ensure that funds allocated for the fire victims are used effectively in the long term to help them rebuild their lives? Are there any specific schemes or initiatives being developed to assist affected families? And how will the funds be allocated toward long-term housing solutions? And in terms of scaffold netting, how will the authorities help those who are unable to meet the deadline by today? Mr Sun, what specific penalties do you foresee for companies or workers who violate the proposed smoking ban that comes into effect?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: For the Support Fund (""Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po""), right now we have already raised a total of $3 billion from the private sector and also from the Government's allocation fund. We hope we will make the best use of this Support Fund to help our residents being affected in this fire incident. As you know, we have already launched several relief funds to cater for their short-term needs. We will also make the best use of the Support Fund to provide long-term and sustainable support and assistance to those residents to help them rebuild their homes and let their lives resume normal.

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. On the prohibition of smoking at construction sites, of course, it's subject to a discussion with the Legislative Council (LegCo) upon its establishment next year, on January 1. One of the issues we have to discuss is about if the consensus among the LegCo and the administration is to prohibit smoking at construction sites in general, we have to consider what kind of penalty we have to put in place.

One of the possible options we could explore is possibly a fixed ticket, so this is one of the ideas we need to explore. But of course, the detailed proposal is to be hammered out after discussions with LegCo and also we're going to consult the trade to make sure that whatever new prohibition is going to be introduced, it is enforceable. Thank you.

選舉管理委員會主席發表《香港家書》（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-12-06 09:45,2025-12-06 10:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/06/P2025120500702.htm,"下稿代選舉管理委員會發出：

以下是選舉管理委員會主席陸啟康法官今日（十二月六日）在香港電台發表《香港家書》的全文︰

鐘豪：

香港特區政府第八屆立法會換屆選舉即將於明日（十二月七日）舉行。每一次選舉前，我也會寫信給你，談談我對舉辦選舉的一些感受。今次我的心情更加沉重。爸爸與全港市民一樣，目睹大埔一場吞噬家園、奪走很多性命的無情大火，很多災民痛失至親和家園，刺痛每一個香港人的心。

我有些朋友問我，在整個社會彌漫着一片憂傷的氣氛下，仍然舉行選舉是否不顧民情？這次選舉到底有甚麼急切性？或者應該押後選舉，以集中資源做好火災善後工作？

其實選舉日期在法理上有一定的重要性。在很多有選舉的地方，選舉日期都不可以輕易改動，否則政府便可以以任何不相關的理由，輕易更改選舉日期。所以很多地方的法例對更改選舉日期都有嚴謹的規定，香港亦不例外。

因此，按照現行選舉法例的規定如期舉行選舉，選出有能力、有擔當的人士擔任立法會議員，避免立法會出現真空，這是非常重要的。新一屆議員在一月一日履職後定會盡快處理災後需要實行的檢討和改革，防止悲劇重演，才是為受災市民和廣大社會負責任的做法。所以即使在這個困難的時刻，選民應該以更加嚴肅的態度去面對他們的公民責任，積極向前看，選出新一屆立法會以發揮他們重要的功能，才符合香港整體利益。一如以往，選舉管理委員會按照現行選舉法規，作出各項選舉安排，同時監督選舉的進行，確保選舉在公開、誠實和公平的原則下進行。

立法會是香港政制的重要一環，它的主要功能是制定法律、審批公共開支，與政府既互相配合又互相制衡。因此，選民的每一張選票都會影響到特區的施政、經濟的發展甚至市民的日常生活。所以在繼續加緊進行救災善後工作的同時，立法會換屆選舉亦是香港特區當前極為重要的工作，兩者並無牴觸。

火災發生後，政府連日馬不停蹄、不遺餘力地去應對，社會各界積極伸出援手，集結了磅礡的救援力量。在選舉人手調配方面，我知道政府經過全面審視人手和資源情況後，在確保有足夠人手支援災民和善後工作的同時，亦會令選舉可以繼續有序進行。

在選舉安排方面，這次我們亦採取了一系列的創新手法加強選民的投票便利，包括為一些特定人員如公務員、醫護人員、少數族裔居民等設立專屬票站，同時為一些居住於安老院和殘疾人士院舍的選民提供外派投票服務，讓這些行動不便的選民也能夠行使他們的投票權利。我們這次亦增加了鄰近邊境票站的數目，進一步便利經不同口岸及管制站出入境和有需要在機場及管制站值勤的選民投票。

受大埔火災影響，區內三個一般投票站不能夠在投票日使用，選舉事務處已經為受影響的選民調整投票站，包括安排他們到附近三個投票站，分別是香港教師會李興貴中學、大埔崇德黃建常紀念學校和羅定邦中學，並會安排接駁交通，方便他們前往新投票站投票，讓他們能夠繼續行使公民權利。

明日舉行的立法會換屆選舉，10個地方選區、28個功能界別和選舉委員會界別的選舉全部均有競爭，總共有161位候選人競逐90個議席。當選的議員，我相信他們會發揮為民請命的強大動力，為災民、為社會盡力謀求福祉。

投票時間方面大家也需要留意一下，在600多個一般投票站、選舉委員會界別投票站，以及設於上水、港珠澳大橋香港口岸旅檢大樓和香港國際機場二號客運大樓的鄰近邊境投票站，投票時間是由上午七時三十分至晚上十一時三十分，共16小時。公務員專屬投票站、醫院管理局醫護人員專屬投票站和少數族裔人士專屬投票站的投票時間是由上午八時三十分至晚上九時三十分；至於院舍外展投票站則由上午八時三十分至下午六時三十分。除了投票通知卡，選民還可以透過「智方便」登入「選民資料網上查閱系統」查閱自己最終獲編配的投票站、位置圖，以及候選人簡介等投票資料。

選舉事務處在投票日需要調配眾多選務工作人員，負責處理投票、點票以及其他支援工作。選舉事務處已經為負責選舉不同崗位的人員舉辦了多場簡介會、演習和模擬訓練，大家上下一心，力求選舉運作暢順，安全有序地進行。爸爸要衷心多謝選舉事務處和其他相關部門，以及所有參與今次選舉的工作人員，感激大家的辛勤和努力，用心籌備這個對香港非常重要的選舉。

順利完成這次立法會選舉的意義十分重大，我亦已經呼籲所有已登記選民在明日踴躍投票，你亦要緊記呼籲身邊的親友一齊投票。我們希望每一位選民也盡大家的公民責任投票，選出新一屆立法會，大家同舟共濟，團結為香港，我們的家園，建設更安全更美好的未來。

爸爸

​行政長官就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒答問內容（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-05 23:47,2025-12-06 00:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500865.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十二月五日）聯同精神健康諮詢委員會主席林正財醫生、醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授、勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡及教育局局長蔡若蓮博士，就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的答問內容：

記者：各位，你們好。第一個問題關於情緒支援，其實在大火發生後，很多民間團體、機構都有情緒支援服務提供，剛才政府都提到很多不同的情緒服務，有沒有渠道可以將民間力量和政府力量整合？有沒有一些特設渠道，例如民間機構處理不到、未必處理到的，就可以及時、很快地反映給政府知道？第二個問題關於地盤。建築業界提到絕大部分的地盤建築商，其實都贊成在地盤全面禁煙，政府會否藉這次事件發生後，將地盤納入為法定禁煙區？謝謝。

行政長官：好，我稍後請林正財主席說明整體情緒支援方面，政府和民間的整合，亦請勞福局局長說明有關地盤吸煙的政策。我強調，這次我們受到災情的影響是方方面面。我們認為除了金錢資助、住宿問題，以及其他關心照顧的需要，我們應該重視災民在整個復常過程中的心理支援，所以我的政策是統整所有力量。政府當然責無旁貸，但民間力量很好。一向以來，在精神健康方面有很多，例如社工或受訓的專業人士，都可以提供服務。大家都聽到，從數字來看，一個非政府組織都可以收到600個求助電話，所以我覺得要凝聚整個社會的共同力量，渡過這次難關。我強調，希望林正財醫生作為精神健康諮詢委員會主席，帶領整個社會推動這方面的工作。我亦感謝他，我一跟他談及這個問題，他很主動地作出部署。我現在請林主席。

精神健康諮詢委員會主席：謝謝特首。對每一個市民來說，其實精神健康沒有區分政府和民間，最重要的是，對災民來說有最適切的服務，亦有足夠有愛心的人，陪伴他們走過最困難的時候。所以，其實在整個過程中，正如剛才特首所說：凝聚力量，大家無分彼此，一起提供服務。我亦知道最困難、最艱難的，就是很多家庭成員需要去認領遺體，有些甚至在這個階段仍未尋獲家人，需要比較高密度的援助，和需要一些很有經驗的臨床心理學家陪伴，這當中大部分都是政府的臨床心理學家。

另一方面，民間亦有很多機構，其實可以向有特殊需要的人士提供幫助。簡單舉幾個例子，正如剛才教育局局長所說，對小朋友來說，他們未必懂得如大人般表達情緒，所以需要遊戲治療，甚至有些小朋友心裏有很多內疚感，卻未能表達。我聽過有小朋友失去家人，或看見一個這麼大的災情，他平日可能有做運動、有踢球，但他說不想去了，細問下，其實他不想去的意思是他有罪疚感，覺得現在外出踢球是否不太好。但我相信大家都知道，讓小朋友外出做運動、曬太陽，其實對他的心理健康絕對是一件好事，所以我們需要有一些民間組織去陪伴他們，我們也打算這樣做，就是到他們的臨時居所，陪他們玩耍、陪他們做運動，讓他們能夠表達情緒，渡過這段時間。所以可以這樣說，在這段時間，官、商、民有很大的合作。我亦收到很多商界朋友都想盡一分力，可以說這段時間是無分彼此的。

我再多說一個例子，這次受災人士也包括印尼籍和菲律賓籍外傭。少數族裔的心理健康需要，也是我們特別關注的，因為他們的消息可能不太流通，也可能會有些誤解，或由於文化緣故，他們的情緒表達亦未必為中國人、華人所認識的，所以我們都會夥拍一些專門服務少數族裔精神健康的機構，向他們提供服務。所以可以這樣說，委員會會盡最大努力去整合和統籌，若能力不足者，我們會協助加權，無論是政府部門或民間組織，甚或一些居民組織、教會也好、學校也好、家長會也好，我們都想集合大家的力量，一同幫助自己，亦幫助我們身邊的人。

行政長官：接下來請勞福局。

勞工及福利局局長：關於地盤禁煙的問題，根據《工廠及工業經營條例》（第59章），若勞工處在巡查時察覺到有火災風險，便可以指定該地盤為禁煙區，這是勞工處同事一直沿用的做法。只要在巡查當中察覺到有火災風險，便會第一時間將這個地盤指定為禁煙區。我們留意到，現在社會上有強烈的呼聲，認為所有地盤應要禁煙。因此，當新一屆立法會成立後，我們便會第一時間到立法會與議員談論這個問題。如果議員們都認同這個看法，我們會第一時間修例，繼而落實在地盤全面禁煙。

從這件事大家都可看得到在十二月七日投票的逼切性，需要盡快成立新一屆立法會。因為如果新一屆立法會未能成立，即使我們希望回應社會的呼聲，都要通過立法的手段才能落實。

記者：有關「一戶一社工」方面，知道社工每日會打兩次電話給居民，為甚麼會考慮這個安排？有意見指每日兩次對居民造成滋擾，會否反而影響他們的情緒？另外，學界正在討論怎樣安排聖誕的慶祝活動，有些學校直接取消活動，令到學生有些失望，教育局方面會否有相關的指引或建議提供？

行政長官：細節方面，我交給兩位局長回答。我個人為甚麼要求「一戶一社工」？因為每個災民的需要都不一樣，我們對災民或相關人士提供任何服務，都一定要按他的意願和需要，每人差異可能很大。當他很想有人幫助時才去找社工，該名社工可能要處理其他個案，我覺得應該加強對災民的照顧。所以我要求「一戶一社工」的覆蓋率比以往大，我要求是一對一，一名社工支援一戶。若人手壓力很大，加上公務員——無論他是義務的、熱心投入支援受災家庭也好，又或者我們動員的公務員也好——就確保受災人士在有需要時，有人能照顧他。如果有人希望以某種方式與他聯繫，我們一定會尊重他。

另外，關於舉辦活動方面，我們很明白大家都很悲痛。剛才林正財醫生說，我們如何讓災民和整個社會走出這個困擾，確保我們的精神不要受今次事件長期困擾？盡量過正常生活是有幫助的，剛才林醫生舉例一些運動和活動。每個活動或每個組織者的活動性質不同，最重要是要尊重罹難人士，予以追思，但我覺得整個社會都要逐步逐步地盡快回復正常，這對於災民回復正常生活都很重要。我現在請勞福局局長再談談「一戶一社工」的實際運作。

勞工及福利局局長：多謝行政長官。行政長官說得十分清楚，「一戶一社工」的目的是希望提供最貼心、最好的支援給受影響的家庭。根據過往數日的實際操作，我們察覺到社工早上和下午各致電一次，接通率都十分高，大約是百分之八十五左右，這意味大多數的住戶是歡迎社工來電傾談。當然有少數居民沒有接聽，或許因為心情比較沉重，這方面我們表示尊重。所以隨着計劃一直進行，當社工親身與他們見面，又協助他們處理很多事情時，大家加深了解後，就可以因應每個家庭的實際狀況，慢慢調整一個最適合他們的聯絡方法，我們會處理這方面的工作，大家要對我們的專業社工有信心，亦希望通過「一戶一社工」幫到這1 900多戶家庭，讓他們可以盡快重回比較順暢的生活，我們會全力以赴的。

教育局局長：有報道指個別學校取消聖誕聯歡會，有同學不開心。事實上，在十一月二十九日全港哀悼三天時，我們通知了學校十一月二十九日至十二月一日這三天內，盡量避免舉行一些慶祝活動。過了這三天，正如我、行政長官和林正財醫生剛才所說，最重要是我們適當去表達。在這個過程裏，每一間學校面對的情況都不一樣，最重要是過程中要有同理心。今日我已在「全港教育界特別事故支援小組」這個供全港校長溝通的平台提到這件事，大家很認同，應可轉化這些活動，例如以平安和感恩為主題，讓同學有正常的學習活動。謝謝。

記者：之前有議員發表想進行休會辯論，但是否礙於快舉行立法會選舉而取消休會辯論﹖剛才亦有提及，新的立法會會期開展後會盡快提出議案，會否提早讓公眾知道當中的建議和細節﹖另外，剛才說到要照顧很多有需要人士的精神健康，但之前數日也講述很多部門在工作細節上出現疏漏之處，會否盡快公布獨立委員會的工作範圍﹖特首或個別部門會否向死者家屬或死者致歉？

行政長官：首先，我是重視大家積極行動幫助災民。在發生事故後，全政府總動員出動，以實際行動幫助災民。

我們很聽意見的，聽意見的方式很多，隨時現在提供的意見也收集了很多。我們一直推出不同措施的加強版，以及增加覆蓋面，都是在進行支援工作中聽到的意見，所以增加一些資助金額、增加覆蓋面、免稅、免醫療費等，我們都做了。我們更加知道很多災民希望有一個較為令他們覺得適當的住宿，所以現時大致上已經差不多為大部分災民安排了，只有小部分用自己方法，或單位數還留在中心的人士。行動非常重要，意見收集有很多方式，所以我們希望有意見提供，但更重要是行動。

另外，我提過關於獨立委員會的工作。首先我很強調，一定會查明真相、追究責任、推動改革，我多次說過。我亦已經與終審法院首席法官交流，現時正邀請法官擔任獨立委員會的工作。我重視查出真相，應該要快，讓大家盡早可以了解清楚，亦在過程中可以盡快改革，強化整個制度，填補所有漏洞。我正在思考如何可以既查得水落石出，又可以盡早推動系統改革。當我找到合適的法官——因為他都要在工作量方面能夠應付，我會和被推薦的法官詳細討論這些問題。我強調重要的幾點，第一，必須查明真相，必須查個水落石出，要負責任的人必須負責；第二，我既重視有一個有效查明真相的方法，更重視高效處理問題。我希望和被推薦的法官詳細討論細節後，盡快向大家公布。

任何人需要負責的都要負責，系統改造和改革會涉及八方面，如果將來在任何委員會、調查中發現誰要負責，誰就要負責。希望大家都明白，沒有人希望見到這次悲劇，而我們看到不同環節的漏洞，導致這次火勢蔓延得這麼快，而且死傷如此嚴重。我們要實事求是，找出負責的人，要他負責，這是最公道的方法。在這階段，我們聽意見，幫助所有人，但同時希望要進行工作的人可以繼續工作。我們應該本着一個心，為這件事情找到真相後，按着所找出來的結果予以認真處理、追責處理。多謝大家。"
​行政長官就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（二）（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-05 23:45,2025-12-06 00:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500866.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十二月五日）聯同精神健康諮詢委員會主席林正財醫生、醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授、勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡及教育局局長蔡若蓮博士，就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的開場發言：

精神健康諮詢委員會主席：多謝特首。精神健康諮詢委員會在十日前知道大埔有一個如此巨大的災情時，一直很關心災民和市民的精神健康狀況，所以一直有與不同的政府部門和局了解、合作，亦向很多志願機構、居民組織明白和了解——他們在災場附近位置，特別在大埔區——他們所提供的服務，如何能夠更好結合。所以我們與一些社會服務機構即時在災場設立心靈加油站，提供心靈照顧服務，我們希望在這段時間，讓市民要先照顧好自己，才可以照顧有需要的人，所以在這段時間，我們一直都很關心。

昨日，我們召開了一次緊急會議，邀請了一些專家，特別是對災後精神健康有研究的專家，與我們一同開會，亦跟醫務衞生局、勞福局、教育局和其他政府部門，包括社署、基層醫療署、衞生署等一同開會，以讓我們可以將精神健康支援工作做得更好和更加精準。因為我們留意到在這段時間，其實不同組群人士的精神健康挑戰都有所不同，由於時間關係，我們特別針對最緊急的服務，所以在昨日的會議，我們建議政府有幾個服務點都需要加強，同時我們的工作已經立即展開。

我舉兩個例子——其實是多於兩個例子，其中一個是我們如何支援有逝去家人的百多個家庭。我們明白在最初一、兩天，可能心情會比較起伏，但現在慢慢開始就要面對其後的生活、安葬問題等，所以我們會安排香港十多間對哀傷輔導有經驗的機構，加上一些精神科醫生和臨床心理學家，藉着「一戶一社工」的機制，逐戶配對這百多個家庭，讓我們可以陪伴他們走過最哀傷的日子。專家亦跟我們說，如此大型的災害，他們很有可能都會面對一個醫學上稱為複雜的哀傷期，所以我們都希望有輔導員和專家，他們在這方面有經驗，可以陪伴和讓家人在傷痛時得到輔導，這是其中一個例子。

另外一個例子，因為現時有幾百個家庭分散在不同的臨時居所，我們都希望支援在這些居所服務的志願團體，從而做好精神健康的支援，所以我們與醫管局商討過，想借用他們「心靈綠洲」的經驗，請醫管局同事培訓我們在外聘請的精神科護士、社工、輔導員等，進入這些居所、居民暫住的環境，提供一些精神健康的支持和培訓。下星期一或二，我們就會開會，開展這個工作。還有幾個不同的比較緊急的工作，在此我不詳述了。

下星期我們會召開第二次會議，商討下一步工作，包括培訓工作，我們有大量社工需要接受培訓，我們都希望能夠向市民提供一些正確的精神健康護理常識，所以我們都會就這方面在下星期進行討論。我們亦會在下星期開始討論，專家說市民大眾，特別是周邊市民，一個月後可能有十至二十個百分比的市民，有機會面對創傷後遺症，所以我們都會討論應對措施，以及如何加強培訓和加強服務量。這個工作，專家亦跟我們說，很有可能要延續一年時間，所以這個工作亦不是一個短時間。委員會會跟政府緊密合作，亦會集合民間力量，讓我們可以和香港七百萬市民，一起渡過這個困難時刻，令我們的生活可以復原，亦令香港可以更強大。多謝大家。

醫務衞生局局長：醫務衞生局是統籌醫院管理局、衞生署、基層醫療署，以至很多志願機構和我們的私營醫療界別，為這次火災的災民，以及大眾提供醫療和心理的支援。我先談談醫院管理局照顧這次火災傷者的情況，除了四位當日送到醫院搶救無效的死者外，醫院管理局共接收79位傷者。到目前為止，今日所有的傷者已經脫離了危險期。在79位傷者中，有49位已經出院，另外有30位仍然在醫院──六位情況嚴重，24位穩定。換句話說，我們已經沒有任何危殆個案在醫院。

在這79位傷者中，他們很多都有心理上的障礙，確實他們面對了一個非常大的創傷。有47位已經由我們的臨床心理學家提供了服務和一些治療，其他的會按照他們的臨床需要，我們會在適合的時間提供服務。

其中一些病人，例如我今日在醫院探望的其中一位病人，可以和大家談談他們面對的困難。這位病人本身受到一個頗大程度的燒傷，他在入院時有呼吸困難，曾經要進深切治療部，要使用呼吸機。他脫離呼吸機後情況穩定下來，他不僅面對身體那麼大的燒傷，亦有很多精神方面的反應。一些病人清醒後，首先很多會出現內疚和自責，因為他們有些家人在火災中不幸喪生，他們一醒了就開始想：是不是有些事可以做得更多，可以幫到家人或救得多一些人呢？另一點是，他們很多都有失眠的問題、焦慮的問題，他們想到將來，晚上亦很難入眠，這毫無疑問需要我們的臨床心理學家和醫生給予一些藥物去幫助他們。今日見到那位傷者，另外有一點我特別感慨的是，他甚至覺得麻煩了我們的醫護人員，他多次說他令醫護人員那麼忙。當然，豪無疑問我們的醫護人員會完全盡心盡力地照顧他。我們亦多次跟他說，他不需要介意，這是我們的責任，也是我們的光榮。除了醫院裏的病人，醫務衞生局的基層醫療署、衞生署和一些志願機構，在災情發生後即時在庇護中心為災民提供24小時的醫療站，當中有72位來自公私營的臨床心理學家，亦有70位精神科護士，為庇護中心裏的災民提供醫療服務，包括心理支援。我們提供超過2 000人次服務中，其中超過400人次是與心理支援有關，所以需求是相當大。

另一方面，隨着災民離開庇護中心到政府提供的住房，包括酒店、青年宿舍，以至過渡性房屋，我們的服務不再限於庇護中心。我們在庇護中心的醫療站會繼續，但考慮到他們已到了社區，所以我們以基層醫療署的18區地區康健中心作為樞紐。我們已在十二月一日開始在18個地區康健中心為市民提供熱線，會有個案經理，災民可通過熱線或者直接前往地區康健中心，視乎他們所在的社區，由上午十時至晚上八時都有個案經理為他們提供醫療方面，包括心理方面的支援，個案經理會協助安排藥物、家庭醫學門診的需求。在政府的醫院管理局門診方面，亦會為所有災民提供免費服務。通過地區康健中心樞紐和家庭醫學門診，在今次事件中已為災民提供超過300人次家庭醫學門診服務。

在十二月四日，我們很開心得到私營醫療界別的支援，有超過140位家庭醫生加入我們的行列，由地區康健中心作網絡，為受影響居民提供私營醫生的義診服務。由昨日開始，我們已接獲十多個致電地區康健中心的來電，其中四個需要心理支援，亦有兩個直接前往家庭醫生接受義診服務。 我們會繼續推廣這些服務，令更多災民知道服務就在身邊的地區康健中心，他們亦不需要前往指定的地區康健中心，所有地區康健中心都會為其提供服務，視乎他們方便。

另一方面是特首剛才提及的「情緒通」18111服務，這是24小時的，在火災當日，我們已即時指示「情緒通」18111中心增加人手，已增加了差不多雙倍人手，火災發生後的電話數目有顯著增加，由過往的平均每日300多，到最高的一日有接近600，在這些「情緒通」18111的來電中，以電話來計，平均差不多兩成跟大埔火災有關。

而我們上月開始增加了一些新服務，包括可以使用WhatsApp文字，因為可能有人不想用語言去溝通，或者語言或聽覺方面有問題等，使用WhatsApp相對的比例較高，同事告訴我們，使用WhatsApp的個案，平均有三分之一與大埔火災有關，而最高一日甚至三分之二的WhatsApp求助都與大埔火災有關，所以我覺得這是很重要的支援，亦有一個個案有少數族裔人士用18111。「情緒通」18111服務上月開始已經增加了剛才我提及的WhatsApp文字諮詢，以至增加了九種少數族裔語言服務，今次可以派上用場，九種語言包括印尼語、菲律賓的Tagalog語言（他加祿語），以至尼泊爾語、印地語等，這可以照顧火災中少數族裔的需要。

接下來我們會跟精神健康諮詢委員會繼續保持合作，在提供服務方面，我們希望繼續推廣「情緒通」18111，做更多教育工作，我們亦有三層應急機制，會盡快推廣地區康健中心的「健康心靈先導計劃」至大埔區及其附近的地區康健中心。至於第三層一些需要專業人員例如精神科醫生（協助的災民），我們會建立一條精神健康專線，由社會福利署的社工直接轉介至醫管局的精神科處理，這是較為緊急的個案，我們會建立這樣的精神健康專線。

勞工及福利局局長：各位傳媒朋友，在大埔宏福苑大火發生後，社會福利署（社署）轄下的2 000多位社工和60多位臨床心理學家第一時間全體出動。首先，特別是事件發生後的首數天，社署的社工、臨床心理學家在臨時庇護中心、醫院、殮房陪伴家屬認屍、陪伴他們渡過最艱難的數天。

另外，我們1 900多名社工已經第一時間啓動並落實「一戶一社工」的支援，這是一個無限期的幫忙。截至今日下午四時，已經超過1 900戶登記了「一戶一社工」，即只剩下十多戶就達致全數登記。在「一戶一社工」的運作下，社工每日都會致電相關的家庭，透過每日的溝通提供即時的情緒支援。正如盧醫生（盧寵茂教授）所說，如果我們發現是高危個案、有很大情緒問題，社工會第一時間用醫院管理局提供的專線，幫助他盡快在醫管局看專科精神科醫生，並跟進個案。

此外，我們與社福界提供哀傷管理服務的社福機構協調合作，幫助其他在這方面有需要的家庭，在哀傷管理方面，跟我們的社工一起幫助這些家庭。

我們亦明白到，除了受災家庭外，其實在大埔區也有很多家庭受精神困擾，所以在火災發生之後，我們第一時間要求在大埔、沙田以及北區的精神健康綜合社區中心、長者和青少年的單位提供全面的情緒支援和情緒教育，以幫助當區居民渡過難關。

此外，我們也留意到晚上有青少年在大埔區流連，他們可能有情緒困擾，所以我們已經在運作當中，找到當區很有經驗的青少年服務單位，晚上在街道設置街站，一直至凌晨二時也有社工在場，幫助有需要、有情緒困擾的青少年，協助他們渡過難關，多謝各位。

教育局局長：在大埔火災發生當天，我們看到有同學、家長和老師受事故有不同程度的衝擊和影響，所以當天我們第一時間已經派出教育心理學家和大埔區（教育局）學校發展主任到現場照顧受影響的同學，在各個地方安撫他們，讓他們不用那麼徬徨。隨着事情的發展，目前我們的校本教育心理學家以分層支援的模式，因應同學、老師或家長受影響的不同程度，提供校本教育心理服務，包括為受到較大影響的學校，幫助學校主持危機應變工作小組會議，同時亦引導老師，協助他們去舉行特別班主任課，幫助同學去理解整件事情，或讓他們去回應一些問題，幫助老師更專業地應對。

除了教育心理學家的支援外，我們也明白除了大埔區的學校受影響，全港的學校、同學和老師，也受到事故的影響。當學校要復課，第二天同學上學的時候，就學校要怎麼幫助同學去理解這件事，我們開發了一些教學資源套，包括如何處理創傷，幫助同學去應對和幫助老師照顧同學。同時，除了開發這些教學資源套外，我們也要讓老師和家長知道如何跟小朋友講這件事，所以我們也在十一月二十九日及三十日連續邀請精神科醫生、教育心理學家、輔導專家和學校社工，一起舉辦了很多場講座，幫助家長和老師學會如何跟同學談這件事情，去面對這件事情，我們會繼續開發這方面的工作。

隨着我們更深入了解學校的不同情況，亦因應大埔區受影響較大的八所學校，包括有中學、小學和幼稚園，我們特別組成「一校一支援」團隊。這團隊是由專業的學校教育心理學家和（教育局）課程發展主任和學校主任一起組成的數人小組，以駐校的模式去支援在這段時間特別有需要的學校，幫助它們處理各方面工作，包括對於住在宏福苑的受災同學，他們的家庭需要或面對的情緒需要。

我們明白在這段時間，同學是額外需要安全感和很多的關愛。我想借此機會，感謝前線的老師、校長、社會各界都很關心我們的同學，讓他們在這段很艱難的時間，有很多關心和愛包圍着他們，讓他們能夠克服，再一次多謝大家。對於老師的情緒，我們也知道老師除了日常的教學，也要面對很多，要額外照顧同學心理和情緒需要，所以我們也設立了「教師陽光專線」，去幫助有需要的老師有一個傾訴的途徑。謝謝。"

投票站將設立兩條隊伍，一條特別隊伍供年滿70歲的人士、孕婦及因身體狀況而難以長時間站立排隊的人士使用；另一條隊伍則供一般選民使用。投票站內設有座位，讓有需要的選民坐下休息，稍後才排隊領取選票。

為便利選民於選舉當日投票，特區政府將在超過30個投票站附近提供少量臨時停車位，讓有需要人士短暫停泊並前往投票站投票。有關停車位的開放時間一般為選舉當日早上七時三十分至晚上十一時三十分，而當日的詳細安排（包括可免費停泊的時間及後續收費安排（如有））將以該場地的使用規則和場地負責人的指示為準。臨時停車位的詳情請參閲附件。

在投票日，選民可於選舉網站（www.elections.gov.hk）查看一般投票站、選委會界別投票站和鄰近邊境投票站的大概輪候時間，選民可因應輪候情況和個人日程而安排投票時間。

投票程序

是次選舉大部分一般投票站會使用電子選民登記冊系統發出選票。投票程序很簡單，選民進入投票站後，工作人員會指示選民到發票櫃枱。選民要出示有效香港身份證正本，工作人員會使用平板電腦掃描選民的身份證。選民可以在平板電腦看到自己的姓名、部分身份證號碼和獲發的選票類別，確保資料準確，然後領取選票進入投票間。

地方選區選民必須用投票站提供的印章，親自在所選擇的候選人相對的圓圈內蓋上一個「剔」號，無須摺疊選票，將選票正面向下，放入藍色投票箱。功能界別選民須用投票站提供的黑色筆，親自在功能界別選票上填滿所選擇候選人姓名旁邊的橢圓圈，無須摺疊選票，將選票正面向下，放入紅色投票箱。

選委會界別方面，選民必須投選不多於亦不少於40名候選人，否則選票即告無效，不會被點算。選民須使用投票站提供的黑色筆，填滿選票上所選擇候選人姓名旁的橢圓形。填劃選票後，應使用選票檢測機，檢查選票上所選取的候選人數目是否40名。選票檢測機並不會記錄選票上的選擇。選民無需摺疊選票，將選票已填劃的一面向下，放入白色投票箱。

投票是自主及保密的。選民須於投票間內親自填劃選票。如選民需要協助，可以聯絡投票站職員。投票站內不可以干擾別人投票，或者使用電子器材通訊、拍照、錄音或錄影。投票站內亦不可以進行拉票活動、派發選舉廣告或者展示宣傳品。

為確保選民清楚了解投票程序，選舉事務處製作了電視宣傳短片和電台宣傳聲帶，並已上載至選舉網站供選民參考。

點票和公布結果

投票結束後，大部分一般投票站會立即轉換為點票站，用以點算地方選區選票。獲編配少於500名選民投票的小投票站、專用投票站、選委會界別投票站、鄰近邊境投票站、專屬投票站和院舍外展投票站，其地方選區選票則會被送到九龍公園體育館的選票分流站兼綜合大點票站點算。所有功能界別及選委會界別的票箱則會被運送到位於會展的中央點票站，以進行點票。

當地方選區完成點票後，每個點票站的投票站主任會將點票結果通知在場的候選人或他們的代理人。核實同一個地方選區所有點票站的點票結果後，選舉事務處會將整體點票結果通知會展中央點票站內的選舉主任，並由選舉主任在新聞中心簽署和宣布選舉結果。至於功能界別和選委會界別，在點票結束並經數據資訊中心核實點票結果後，選舉主任會通知在場的候選人和他們的代理人點票結果，並在中央點票站的點票區內簽署和宣布選舉結果。選舉主任其後會在新聞中心的禮台上再次讀出所有選舉結果。

選舉結果會透過新聞稿和選舉網站發放，亦會在新聞中心外展示。

廉潔選舉

選舉事務處發言人提醒，根據《選舉（舞弊及非法行為）條例》（第554章），在選舉期間內藉公開活動煽惑他人不投票、投白票或廢票屬非法行為；而妨礙或阻止選民在選舉中投票屬舞弊行為。

Electors reminded to vote at allocated polling stations and follow proper voting procedures,2025-12-05 23:33,2025-12-05 23:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500882.htm,"The 2025 Legislative Council General Election (LCGE) will be held on December 7 (Sunday). A spokesman for the Registration and Electoral Office (REO) said today (December 5) that poll cards have been mailed to about 4.13 million registered electors. Electors should vote at their allocated polling stations and follow proper voting procedures when casting their votes.

Poll cards

  In addition to the poll card, the election mail sent to each elector by the REO also includes a map indicating the location of the allocated polling station, a guide on voting procedure, introduction to candidates leaflets in respect of his/her relevant constituency(ies), and a publicity leaflet on clean elections by the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

  The REO spokesman said, ""In response to the Electoral Affairs Commission's earlier announcement to extend the polling hours for this LCGE, the previous polling hours stated in the poll cards and other relevant documents already sent out by the REO are no longer valid. Electors should note that the REO has sent out another notice to all Hong Kong electors, stating the new polling hours (i.e. from 7.30am to 11.30pm).""

  Due to the Tai Po fire, adjustments have been made to three polling stations in the district. Affected electors need to relocate from their original polling stations to the reallocated polling stations for casting their votes. Except for those electors of Wang Fuk Court who are currently residing in other districts, the REO has sent a notice to affected electors in Kwong Fuk Estate, Tai Po Kau area and Tai Po Market to inform them of their reallocated polling stations. The affected electors may also check relevant voting information by logging into the Online Voter Information Enquiry System (www.voterinfo.gov.hk) through ""iAM Smart"" or the Voter Registration website (vr.gov.hk).

Arrangements of polling stations

  The REO spokesman said, ""There are over 4.13 million geographical constituency (GC) electors across the territory. The REO will set up 612 Ordinary Polling Stations. GC and functional constituency (FC) electors may go to the Ordinary Polling Station allocated to them and cast their votes for the candidates of their GCs and FCs (if applicable) at the same time. Approximately 1 500 electors of the Election Committee constituency (ECC) can cast their votes for all relevant constituencies at the polling station at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC).""

  On the polling day, the polling hours for the Ordinary Polling Stations, the ECC polling station, the three Dedicated Polling Stations set up at police stations and the Near Boundary Polling Stations (NBPSs) will be from 7.30am to 11.30pm. For the Dedicated Polling Stations set up at penal institutions, for security reasons, the polling hours will be from 9am to 4pm. For the Designated Polling Stations and Outreach Polling Stations for Residential Care Homes under the pilot arrangements, their polling hours are from 8.30am to 9.30pm, and from 8.30am to 6.30pm respectively.

  Two queues will be set up at the polling stations. One queue is for people aged 70 or above, pregnant women and persons who are unable to queue for a long time due to physical conditions, while the other queue is for ordinary electors. Seats will be provided in the polling stations for any electors in need, and to join the queue afterwards for collecting their ballot papers.

To facilitate the voting by electors on the polling day, the Government has identified different premises nearby over 30 polling stations to provide some temporary parking spaces. Those in need may park their vehicles there for a short duration for casting their votes at the polling stations. The opening hours of the parking spaces concerned are in general from 7.30am to 11.30pm on the polling day. Electors should refer to the terms of use and the instructions of the management of the premises for the detailed arrangements that day (including the duration of free parking and the parking fee thereafter (if any)). Details of the temporary parking spaces are at annex.

  On the polling day, electors can check the approximate waiting time of Ordinary Polling Stations, the ECC polling station and NBPSs on the election website (www.elections.gov.hk). Depending on the waiting time and their schedule, electors can make their own arrangements on when to vote.

Voting procedures

Most Ordinary Polling Stations will make use of the Electronic Poll Register (EPR) System to issue ballot papers. The polling procedures are very simple. Electors will be instructed by the polling staff to the issuing desks after they enter the polling station. The elector must show the original of his/her valid Hong Kong identity (HKID) card and the polling staff will scan the elector's HKID card with an EPR tablet. The elector may check his/her name, partial HKID card number and the type(s) of ballot paper(s) that he/she is entitled to on an EPR tablet for verification of information. The elector may then enter the voting compartment upon collection of the ballot paper(s).

  GC electors must affix the chop provided at the polling station to mark a single 'tick' in the circle opposite the name of the candidate of their choice on the ballot paper by themselves, and then insert the unfolded ballot paper into the blue ballot box with the marked side facing down. As for FCs, electors must mark the ballot paper using the black pen provided at the polling station to fill in the oval on the ballot paper opposite the name(s) of the candidate(s) of their choice by themselves, and then insert the unfolded ballot paper into the red ballot box with the marked side facing down.

  ECC electors must vote for 40 candidates, no more and no less. Otherwise, the ballot paper will be considered invalid and will not be counted. Electors must use the black pen provided at the polling station to fill in the oval opposite the names of the candidates of their choice. After marking the ballot paper, electors should use the Ballot Paper Checking Machine to check whether the number of candidates marked on the paper is 40. The machine will not record the choices marked on the ballot paper. Electors should put the ballot paper, unfolded with the marked side facing down, into the white ballot box.

  The ballot is autonomous and secret. Electors must mark their ballot papers on their own in the voting compartment. If in need, electors may ask for assistance from the polling staff. Electors must not disturb others during voting, nor use electronic communication devices, take photographs or make audio or video recordings in the polling stations. Canvassing, distribution of election advertisements or displaying propaganda materials are also prohibited inside polling stations.

  To ensure that electors understand the polling procedures, the REO has produced a set of TV and radio Announcements in the Public Interest which have been uploaded onto the election websitefor electors' reference.

Counting and result announcement

  After the close of poll, a majority of the Ordinary Polling Stations will be changed to counting stations immediately for the counting of GC votes. For small polling stations of which less than 500 electors are assigned to vote, Dedicated Polling Stations, the ECC polling station, NBPSs, Designated Polling Stations and Outreach Polling Stations for Residential Care Homes, the GC ballot papers will be delivered to the ballot paper sorting station cum consolidated main counting stations at Kowloon Park Sports Centre for counting. The ballot boxes of all FCs and the ECC will be delivered to the Central Counting Station at the HKCEC for counting.

  For the GCs, upon completion of the count, the Presiding Officer of each counting station will make known the counting results to the candidates or their agents present. Upon verification of the counting results of all counting stations in a GC, the REO will notify the Returning Officer (RO) at the Central Counting Station at HKCEC of the overall counting result for the RO to sign and declare the election results at the Media Centre. As for the FCs and ECC, once the counting of votes is completed and the election results are verified by the Statistical Information Centre, the ROs will notify the present candidates and their agents of the counting results, and sign and declare the election results at the counting zone of the Central Counting Station. The election results will be announced again by the ROs on stage of the Media Centre.

   The election results will be published via press releases and the election website, as well as displaying outside the Media Centre.

Clean elections

  The REO spokesman reminded that according to the Elections (Corrupt and Illegal Conduct) Ordinance (Cap. 554), it is illegal conduct to incite any person not to vote, to cast a blank or invalid vote by any activity in public during an election; and it is corrupt conduct if a person willfully obstructs and prevents another person from voting at an election.

  For enquiries, please call the REO's hotline at 2891 1001 or visit the election website for more information on the LCGE."
Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-05 23:25,2025-12-05 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500883.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
------------------------------------

  For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received have reached $2.7 billion as of noon today (December 5). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

  The Government earlier announced that the Support Fund will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 73 cases have been processed, and disbursements are under way. In addition, the Government announced that the Support Fund will provide a living allowance to each affected household. As of today, 923 cases have been processed, and disbursements are ongoing. The Government announced yesterday (December 4) that the living allowance is increased from $50,000 to $100,000. Those households that have already received the living allowance of $50,000 earlier do not need to register again, and the additional $50,000 allowance will be disbursed in phases.

  In addition, the Government has so far disbursed an emergency subsidy of $10,000 to 1 930 households.

  Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 900 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. SWD staff also paid visits to the affected residents staying in transitional housing units in Ta Kwu Ling and a youth hostel in Sham Shui Po today and distributed Octopus cards with a face value of $2,000 to facilitate their daily travels and address their imminent needs. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government. Those not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183 as soon as possible.

Accommodation support
------------------------------

  As of this morning, a total of 1 369 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 499 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. Moreover, the Tai Po District Office continues to operate a temporary shelter at Tai Po Community Centre, which remains open to residents in need. The other temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
------------------------------------

  The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 400 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, Government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items to places in need in phases. So far, over 2 800 pieces of donation items, including bedding and electrical appliances, have been distributed to the accommodations soon to be open for residents to live in. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Funeral services
--------------------

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has arranged extra sessions for selection by families using cremation services and has reserved public niches at Tsang Tsui, Cape Collinson-San Ha, Shek Mun and Wo Hop Shek Columbariums for application by and allocation to the families. The FEHD will also provide full assistance to families choosing green burial. If the families opt for coffin burial, the requirement of exhuming the remains after six years will be relaxed to 12 years, so that the families can have more time to process their emotions and get their lives back on track.

Handling of reported missing persons
---------------------------------------------

  The Police have completed searches inside all seven buildings. Officers from the Disaster Victim Identification Unit conducted searches around the buildings and near the collapsed scaffolding today, which had been confirmed as safe. No human remains were found, and the number of the deceased remains at 159. The officers also handed over suspected human remains found earlier to forensic pathologists for further testing. The Police will continue to follow up on the reported missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible.

Investigations
-----------------

  The Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force, led by the Fire Services Department, examines the fire damage condition for seven buildings (Wang Yan House, Wang Tao House, Wang Sun House, Wang Kin House, Wang Tai House, Wang Cheong House, Wang Shing House).

Regulation and inspection work
--------------------------------------

  The Housing Bureau today continued to arrange emergency maintenance contractors to help the Police clear away miscellaneous items at the surroundings of the buildings. Further support works also continued in the small number of units that may be subject to more damage. Upon liaison with the Police, the Independent Checking Unit (ICU) of the Housing Bureau started to extract concrete cores from three of the seven affected buildings today.

  Regarding the four Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) courts, Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po and On Kay Court in Kwun Tong have completed the removal of protective nets today. The ICU will continue to monitor the progress of the other two HOS courts, namely Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme.

   The Development Bureau announced on December 3 that any scaffold nets installed on external walls of all public and private buildings, as well as government buildings undergoing major repair works, must be immediately removed, and the works at the external walls must cease. As of 3pm today, 115 private buildings have had their scaffold nets removed from the external walls. The Buildings Department (BD) reminded contractors to finish the removal of scaffold nets in a responsible and safe manner. If contractors require more time in individual cases, they should provide justifications for the BD's consideration as to whether discretionary arrangements can be made. Regarding the public works building projects, the Architectural Services Department has completed the removal of scaffold nets from its 18 projects. The BD aims to issue a new practice note next week, requiring all scaffold net materials to be certified by designated laboratories as compliant with relevant requirements before installation.

  The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 300 construction sites, issued a total of 148 written warnings and 79 improvement notices, and taken out 25 prosecutions."
行政長官就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（一）（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-12-05 22:40,2025-12-05 23:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500849.htm,"行政長官李家超今日（十二月五日）聯同精神健康諮詢委員會主席林正財醫生、醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授、勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡及教育局局長蔡若蓮博士，就大埔宏福苑火災跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是李家超的開場發言：

行政長官：各位，大埔宏福苑的火災發生至今已第十日。面對無情火災，香港社會上下一心，特區政府即時推展救援工作，團結社會力量，齊心合力支援受災民眾共渡難關。

我剛剛視察了在油麻地由非政府機構提供的24小時18111「情緒通」熱線。我與前線輔導人員傾談，他們告訴我在火災後，有很多受影響住戶、他們的親屬朋友，以至市民都感到不安、焦慮，亦都收到很多電話。熱線專業人員為他們提供即時的心理支援服務，有些可能是15至20分鐘，有些可以是兩小時或者以上。人員很關心地與他們傾談，提供很多支援，令到他們的身心和其他心理上的需要得到緩解，陪伴需要援助的人在心理上渡過這段艱難時刻。我很感謝他們所提供的服務。我相信大家經歷過今次的無情火災，整個社會都彌漫着哀痛，所以我十分關注災民，以及我們整體社會在精神健康方面的服務、支援如何做得更好。

所以我要求推展精神支援工作，並請林正財醫生作為精神健康諮詢委員會主席，推動這方面工作，和醫務衞生局、教育局及勞工及福利局，共同為災民及其他受影響的人士，包括學生、教師和附近居民等，提供精神健康支援。

我剛才多謝18111熱線的不同專業人士，我們與他們商量了很多工作方面的一些細節，林醫生以及三位局長是與我一起。我稍後請林醫生和三位局長向大家說說他們在精神健康支援方面會怎樣做。

但不安的情緒是需要疏導、安撫，我們在這方面除了追思逝者以外，更加希望幫助生者能夠過渡難關。整體社會都要一起在經歷完災痛後，我們都要互相扶持，希望大家盡快過正常生活。

其中大家傾談了精神健康，除我們支援外，亦應該有一些活動令他們回復正常生活，有些活動都是值得我們考慮，幫助整個社會盡快回復正常。

這個過程中，我強調，我們支援災民的工作不會停頓，我們的支援工作會持續。我們會一直陪伴災民，而且力度會不斷加大，這些與我們在第一時間推出各種金錢上的資助，包括為每位死者提供20萬元給其家人；我們對每名災民發放的一萬元應急補助金；以及現時我們為每個家庭提供的生活津貼由五萬元增加至十萬元等。其他措施，例如我們為災民免稅、免地租、免水費、免排污費、免醫療費，以及安置他們免租住宿等。

我亦指示應急住宿安排工作組組長、財政司副司長黃偉綸籌劃長期住宿的安排，這方面我們會聽取住戶的意見。但我都要提醒大家，在我們全面努力幫助災民時，有些埋沒良心的人想發災難財，他們有些人假冒例如義工去登記、假冒地址領取資助、有些發出假冒籌款的釣魚信息等。這些破壞社會團結、發假消息，想搞分化、搞亂香港的行為，我們必須警惕，因為我們看到亦有部分正利用過往「黑暴」期間大量發放虛假信息，包括以所謂「一消防員」、「一某某」等，試圖利用我們今次災情搞亂香港。

所以我嚴厲譴責任何人用虛假信息發災難財，並欺騙不同社會熱心人士，政府會嚴厲打擊這些無良分子，大家要警惕。

另外，政府就推動改革將會與立法會緊密合作。在立法會召開第一個會議時，政府便會提出政府議案，與立法會商討如何支援災民和重建復常。所以，我們會充分與立法會合作改革我們現有制度，除撥款、安排長遠住宿外，我們更加希望通過立法，改變很多現時制度的一些漏洞，把它堵塞。

今次我們追思逝去者和支援災民同時，大家都要團結一心，共同支持我們推動改革。兩日後是立法會選舉投票日，我也在此強調大家應該投關鍵一票，因為這一票是代表推動改革的一票；是代表我們守護災民的一票；是我們凝聚力量、共同前進的一票。在此，我首先請林正財醫生向大家講講在精神健康支援方面的工作。請林醫生。"

"HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and opposes certain US House of Representatives politicians' so-called ""resolution"" blatantly shielding national security offenders and interfering in Hong Kong affairs",2025-12-05 21:07,2025-12-05 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/05/P2025120500793.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (December 5) strongly condemned certain United States (US) House of Representatives politicians for attempting to use a so-called ""resolution"" to make absurd and fact-twisting comments on the case involving Lai Chee-ying endangering national security, as well as his custodial arrangements, with the intention to pervert the course of justice. Such so-called ""resolution"" attacks and smears the HKSAR's situation regarding its high degree of autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"", safeguarding national security, and protecting human rights. The HKSAR Government expressed strong opposition and dissatisfaction, and must sternly denounce such acts to set the record straight.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said: ""The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that as the legal proceedings of Lai Chee-ying's case involving the Hong Kong National Security Law are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the case in an attempt to interfere with the court to exercise judicial power independently, which might otherwise constitute perverting the course of justice. Yet, certain US politicians have introduced the so-called 'resolution' under the pretext of human rights, democracy and freedom to blatantly comment on the case. This is an obvious attempt to exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR, completely disregarding the spirit of the rule of law. Moreover, the so-called 'resolution' baselessly alleges that Lai Chee-ying has been subjected to inhumane treatment in custody, while turning a blind eye to various human rights violations occurring domestically in the US, is in fact blatant hypocrisy and double standard.""

The spokesman stressed, ""The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, paying no regard to their political stance, background or occupation of the person or organisation involved. In this regard, the claim made in the so-called 'resolution' that Lai Chee-ying has been targeted by the HKSAR authorities because of his political views and participation in public interest issues (including democracy and human rights topics) is completely untrue. The HKSAR Government must solemnly point out that the suggestion that any persons or organisations with certain backgrounds should be immune from legal sanctions for their illegal acts and activities is tantamount to granting such persons privileges to break the law. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the relevant US politicians to respect the fundamental principles of the rule of law and judicial independence and immediately cease their despicable political manipulations that distort facts and glorify criminal acts.""

""On the other hand, the HKSAR Government has also publicly stated on numerous occasions that the medical services received by Lai Chee-ying in custody are adequate and comprehensive. The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, as well as timely medical support. During an earlier public court hearing, senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that the correctional institutions had been arranging daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical services he was receiving, and the Court commended the CSD. As for the arrangement for Lai Chee-ying's removal from association from other PICs (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'), it has all along been made at his own request and approved by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law.""

Regarding the attacks and smears made by the so-called ""resolution"" on the HKSAR's high degree of autonomy under ""one country, two systems"", safeguarding national security, as well as protection of human rights, the spokesman emphasised: ""The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China, is a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under 'one country, two systems', and directly under the Central People's Government. The legal basis for implementing 'one country, two systems' comprises the Constitution and the Basic Law, which provide constitutional guarantee for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality before the law, and is buttressed by the rule of law and independent judicial power.""

""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to the highest principle of 'one country, two systems'. The laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR are precisely for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity; and ensuring the full and faithful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems' under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. It will also better safeguard the fundamental rights and freedoms. The HKSAR Government will continue to resolutely and effectively prevent, suppress, and punish acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, while safeguarding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government once again strongly urges relevant US politicians to discern facts from fallacies, respect the international law and basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs."""
