運輸署多管齊下便利免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照申請,2025-08-13 15:08,2025-08-13 15:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300216.htm,"運輸署今日（八月十三日）宣布，將分階段推出短、中、長期新措施，邁向全面推行網上預約申請免試簽發香港正式駕駛執照服務，並逐步增加名額，提升效率，進一步便利市民。

派籌新安排

由即日起，位於金鐘統一中心的香港牌照事務處對代辦申請免試簽發的人士實行新的派籌要求。所有代辦在領取即日籌時，須於系統同時輸入其個人和各申請人的身分證明文件號碼，有關資料會列印於其籌號。櫃位人員在處理申請時會核對籌號持有人及申請人資料；如與籌號所印不符，所有申請一概不獲受理。

運輸署發言人說：「新安排今日運作大致暢順。為確保有需要的市民公平有序地使用服務，我們將進一步優化免試簽發申請程序和便利市民，擴容增量、多管齊下推出新措施，推動牌證服務電子化。」

邁向全面推行網上預約服務

短期措施：加強查核，改善網上預約安排

署方由九月起，將與有關駕駛執照簽發機構加強合作，包括增加查核免試簽發申請人經網上預約提供的內地駕駛證的資料。如發現資料不真確，預約將被取消，名額會重新開放供其他申請人預約，讓網上預約更有效地運作；


中期措施：全面推行網上預約櫃位服務，取代現場派籌安排，提升處理能力

運輸署在第四季將全面透過網上預約免試簽發櫃位服務，現場不設派籌。屆時，處理免試簽發的櫃位服務會擴展至其餘三個牌照事務處，即位於長沙灣政府合署的九龍牌照事務處、東九龍政府合署的觀塘牌照事務處和沙田政府合署的沙田牌照事務處，並增加預約名額。申請人須在網上預約時上載證明文件核實資格，如發現資料不真確，預約將被取消；及


長期措施：便利申請，研究全面網上辦理申請

署方正積極研究利用人工智能技術處理免試簽發申請程序。申請人如經網上預約及上載文件並通過初步審批，只需按其預約時段帶同申請文件正本前往牌照事務處進行文件審核，便可即日內獲發正式駕駛執照，便利申請人提交申請，減少透過代辦提交申請的需要。


發言人強調，署方一直嚴謹處理和核實每宗免試簽發申請。申請人必須提交足夠、真實和準確的證明文件並完全符合法例訂明的申請資格，其申請方會獲批。

運輸署過去一年推出多項電子牌照服務，包括優化車輛牌照申請，便利車主無須續牌後更換紙本牌照；建立一站式「牌證易」網上平台管理牌證；設置國際駕駛許可證自助服務站；及推出方便市民競投心儀車牌號碼的「拍牌易」等。連同「智方便」接通越來越多政府網上服務，目前大部分牌照和駕駛考試服務均可經網上申請。現時，已有約六成申請人經網上申請國際駕駛許可證，而經網上續領正式駕駛執照的申請約有五成。

署方會持續推動牌照服務電子化，適時公布上述新措施的詳情。"
獲奬泉州提線木偶戲九月亮相「中華文化節2025」綻放古藝新姿（附圖）,2025-08-13 14:30,2025-08-13 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300315.htm,"泉州市提線木偶戲傳承保護中心九月帶同其獲奬節目《古藝新姿木偶戲》重臨香江，於康樂及文化事務署（康文署）策劃的「中華文化節2025」展演七齣經典小戲，並由國家級非物質文化遺產（非遺）代表傳承人陳應鴻率領一眾資深和新晉操偶者，以精巧的木偶造型、細膩的操線功和獨特的劇種音樂，展現閩南民俗千年非遺技藝。

泉州提線木偶戲，古稱「懸絲傀儡」，源於秦漢，晉唐時隨中原移民南遷入閩。傳承至今，保存700多齣傳統劇目和由300多支曲牌唱腔構成的獨有劇種音樂「傀儡調」（包含「壓腳鼓」、「鉦鑼」等古樂器及相應的演奏技法），並發展出一套成熟的操線功夫和獨具特色的偶頭雕刻、木偶造型和製作工藝，劇目中亦保存大量閩南地區的民間習俗和方言俚語。泉州提線木偶戲二○○六年被列入首批國家級非物質文化遺產代表性項目名錄，於二○一二年入選聯合國教科文組織保護非物質文化遺產優秀實踐名冊。

《古藝新姿木偶戲》於二○○二年榮獲第十屆文華獎，多年來曾在五大洲80多個國家和地區上演，劇目多元豐富，其中《元宵樂》重現泉州元宵節期間具有閩南民俗風情的「踩街」場面，當中有「拍胸」、「跳鼓」、「舞獅」等民間舞蹈特色，為長演不衰的劇目；《貴妃醉酒》將京劇的唱腔與「傀儡調」混搭，體現南北戲劇藝術交流的魅力；《若蘭行》出自古戲《織錦回文》選段，細膩刻劃主角蘇若蘭千里尋夫的艱難。

此外，操偶者透過精準而細膩的操線功賦予木偶生命和靈魂，如《小沙彌下山》的木偶小沙彌在風雨路上慌急情狀的各種精妙步態；《鍾馗醉酒》的木偶鍾馗能做到提壺、飲酒、打嗝等動作；《獅子舞》則結合提線木偶和掌中木偶技法，表現母子雙獅親昵嬉戲；《馴猴》的木偶猴子更會彈吉他、騎單車和跟隨的士高音樂跳舞，惟肖惟妙，展現泉州提線木偶在守正創新中煥發的新活力。每場表演設有互動環節，讓觀眾有機會近距離欣賞這項非遺技藝。

泉州市提線木偶戲傳承保護中心成立於一九五二年，是泉州提線木偶戲的主要傳承者。藝團曾多次到訪不同國家和地區演出，並多次參與全國性重要的藝術活動和中央電視台的春節聯歡晚會，亦曾參加二○一九年新年戲曲晚會。

泉州市提線木偶戲傳承保護中心《古藝新姿木偶戲》九月十二日及十三日（星期五及星期六）晚上七時三十分在西灣河文娛中心劇院舉行，唱詞和唸白均設中文及英文字幕。票價分280元及320元，門票現於城市售票網（www.urbtix.hk）發售，電話購票請致電3166 1288。由即日起，購買指定「中華文化節」舞台演出節目、中國戲曲節2025「戲曲電影欣賞」及《大師傳藝‧尋古知新》講座系列可享團體購票或套票優惠。查詢節目詳情及購票優惠，請致電2268 7323，或瀏覽www.ccf.gov.hk/tc/programme/ancient-chinese-puppetry-with-timeless-charm。

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-08-13 14:30,2025-08-13 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300484.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."
Award-winning Quanzhou string puppetry to grace Chinese Culture Festival 2025 in September with timeless charm of ancient art (with photos),2025-08-13 14:30,2025-08-13 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300316.htm,"  The Quanzhou Marionette Show Inheritance and Protection Center will return to Hong Kong this September with its acclaimed programme ""Ancient Chinese Puppetry with Timeless Charm"", featuring seven classic short plays at the Chinese Culture Festival 2025, organised by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD). Led by Chen Yinghong, a representative inheritor of the national intangible cultural heritage, seasoned and emerging puppeteers will showcase millennia-old Minnan (southern Fujian) folk traditions through exquisite puppet modelling, refined string manipulation and the genre's unique musical style.

  Quanzhou string puppetry, historically known as ""hanging silk puppet"", has a long tradition that dates to the Qin and Han dynasties. It was introduced to Fujian by migrants coming from the central plain between the Jin and Tang periods. It has had a repertory of over 700 traditional plays and a unique musical genre called ""kuilei diao"" (or puppet tune, played on ancient instruments such as foot-pressed drums, bell-shaped gongs with corresponding performance techniques), comprising more than 300 set tunes. The art form has developed sophisticated string manipulation skills and unique puppet-head carving, figure modelling and production techniques. Its repertoire retains numerous Minnan folk customs and the dialect. It was included on the first list of Intangible Cultural Heritage at the National Level in 2006, followed by its inscription on UNESCO's Register of Good Safeguarding Practices of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2012.

  ""Ancient Chinese Puppetry with Timeless Charm"", which won the prestigious 10th Wenhua Award in 2002, has captivated audiences across over 80 countries and regions on five continents. This diverse repertoire brings to life the rich heritage of Quanzhou string puppetry through a selection of timeless classics: ""Lantern Festival Delight"" recreates the vibrant Minnan folk tradition of ""Cai Jie"" (street parades) during Quanzhou's Lantern Festival, featuring lively folk dance elements such as ""chest slapping,"" ""jumping drums"" and the lion dance, making it a perennial favourite; ""The Drunken Royal Concubine"" ingeniously blends Peking opera vocals with ""kuilei diao"", showcasing the fascinating exchange between northern and southern theatrical arts; ""Ruolan's Journey"", an excerpt from the ancient play ""The Palindromic Poems on the Brocade"", poignantly depicts the arduous journey of Su Ruolan across 1,000 miles in search of her husband.

  In addition, the puppeteers breathe life and soul into the marionettes through precise and delicate string manipulation. In ""The Little Monk's Descent into the Mountain"", the little monk puppet exhibits a repertoire of intricate stumbling gaits, vividly capturing his flustered haste through wind and rain; the Zhong Kui puppet in ""The Drunkenness of Zhong Kui"" performs nuanced actions such as lifting a wine pot, drinking, and even hiccupping; the ""Lion Dance"" combines string and palm puppetry techniques to portray an affectionate mother-and-cub lion duo at play; the monkey puppet in ""Taming the Monkey"" astounds by playing a guitar, riding a bicycle and grooving to disco beats, showcasing Quanzhou string puppetry's innovative spirit while honouring tradition. The programme also features an interactive segment during each performance, offering audiences a rare chance to engage up close with the intangible cultural heritage artistry.

  Founded in 1952, the Quanzhou Marionette Show Inheritance and Protection Centeris a principal guardian of Quanzhou string puppetry. The troupe has performed across different countries and regions, and has been featured in numerous national-level arts events, including China Central Television's Spring Festival Gala. Notably, the troupe participated in the 2019 New Year Traditional Opera Gala.

  ""Ancient Chinese Puppetry with Timeless Charm""by the Quanzhou Marionette Show Inheritance and Protection Centerwill be held at 7.30pm on September 12 and 13 (Friday and Saturday) at the Theatre of the Sai Wan Ho Civic Centre. Lyrics and dialogues are with Chinese and English surtitles. Tickets priced at $280 and $320 are available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk). For telephone bookings, please call 3166 1288. Group booking discounts and package booking discounts are available for purchasing selected CCF stage programmes, the ""Chinese Opera Film Shows"" of the Chinese Opera Festival (COF) 2025 and the ""Legacy and Vision: Conversations with Chinese Cultural Masters"" lecture. For programme enquiries and concessionary schemes, please call 2268 7323 or visit www.ccf.gov.hk/en/programme/ancient-chinese-puppetry-with-timeless-charm.

  The CCF, presented by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and organised by the Chinese Culture Promotion Office under the LCSD, aims to promote Chinese culture and enhance the public's national identity and cultural confidence. It also aims to attract top-notch artists and arts groups from the Mainland and other parts of the world for exchanges in Chinese arts and culture. The CCF 2025 is held from June to September. Through different performing arts programmes in various forms and related extension activities, including selected programmes of the COF, ""Tan Dun WE-Festival"", film screenings, exhibitions, as well as community and school activities and more, the festival provides members of the public and visitors with more opportunities to enjoy distinctive programmes that showcase fine traditional Chinese culture, thereby facilitating patriotic education and contributing to the inheritance, transformation and development of traditional Chinese culture in Hong Kong.

The case involved an unauthorised structure with an area of about 18 square metres on the ground floor of a residential building on Fu Shin Street, Tai Po. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (August 13), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay.

"Special traffic and transport arrangements for Kai Tak Sports Park concerts on August 15 to 17, 19 and 20",2025-08-13 11:00,2025-08-13 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300214.htm,"The Transport Department (TD) today (August 13) said that, to facilitate the holding of concerts at the Kai Tak Sports Park (KTSP) on the evenings of August 15 to 17, 19 and 20, special traffic and transport arrangements will be implemented to provide convenience for spectators to travel to and from the KTSP. Concertgoers from the Mainland are urged to purchase tickets in advance, plan their journeys early and use the MTR or cross-boundary coach services.

  During the event period, as the traffic in the vicinity of the KTSP is expected to be heavy, concertgoers should opt for public transport and avoid driving or taking private cars (including cross-boundary private cars).

  The TD has co-ordinated with local and cross-boundary public transport operators to strengthen their services during dispersal. The MTR will enhance the interval between trains of the Tuen Ma Line (TML). Franchised bus companies will provide a total of 11 special bus routes at the Sung Wong Toi Road Pick-up/Drop-off Area (PUDOA) to Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) Public Transport Interchange (PTI), the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Hong Kong Port and Airport, and major districts across the territory.

  In addition, the KTSP will arrange cross-boundary coach services during dispersal to facilitate travellers' return to the Mainland via the Lok Ma Chau/Huanggang (LMC/HG) Port, the HZMB and the Shenzhen Bay Port. Passengers should purchase tickets in advance. On-site ticket sales will not be available during dispersal. They should refer to the operators' website (Eternal East Bus: www.myeebus.com/eebusfans; CTG Bus: m.hkctgbus.com/#/layout/home) for the latest ticket information.

  For taxi services, the Kai Tak Stadium Taxi PUDOA will be open for taxi pick-up and drop-off. The Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA will be open for taxi drop-off only during admission (4pm to 7.30pm) and suspended for taxi pick-up/drop-off during dispersal. The expected waiting time will be longer amid the outflux of spectators, and passengers' patience is appreciated.

  Concertgoers who plan to return to the Mainland on the same day after the concert should pay special attention that, if they use the Lo Wu Control Point, they should catch the last relevant MTR TML train departing from Sung Wong Toi Station at 10.59pm and Kai Tak Station at 11.01pm, followed by interchanging at Tai Wai Station on the East Rail Line (ERL) to Lo Wu Station. Travellers should plan their journeys ahead and arrive at the station platform in advance.

  Travellers who opt for LMC/HG Port (operating 24 hours daily) may also take the ERL to Sheung Shui Station and then KMB route No. 276B or N73, or take the special bus route No. SP12 directly at the Sung Wong Toi Road PUDOA to the Lok Ma Chau (San Tin) PTI, and transfer to the LMC-HG cross-boundary shuttle bus (Yellow Bus) for their journey to the Mainland.

  A spokesman for the TD said that, as a large number of travellers may use the LMC/HG Port after the concert, and football matches will also be held at Hong Kong Stadium on the evenings of August 19 and 20, the Port is expected to be very busy. Travellers' patience is appreciated. To ensure the smooth operation of public transport services, dedicated public transport lanes will be arranged at the LMC/HG Port after midnight during the event period when necessary for the smooth operation of the Yellow Bus and cross-boundary coach services as well as effective dispersal of a large number of cross-boundary travellers. Other cross-boundary private cars and their passengers are expected to have a longer clearance time. The TD has steered operators to reserve standby vehicles and manpower to meet passengers' demand.

  Spectators are advised to heed the real-time information via the on-site broadcast and the ""Easy Leave"" platform (easyleave.police.gov.hk) as well as the latest traffic news through the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk), the ""HKeMobility"" mobile application and radio and television broadcasts."
啟德體育園八月十五至十七、十九及二十日演唱會特別交通及運輸安排,2025-08-13 11:00,2025-08-13 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300213.htm,"運輸署今日（八月十三日）表示，為配合八月十五至十七、十九及二十日晚上於啟德體育園舉行的演唱會，將實施特別交通及運輸安排便利觀眾往返。來港觀看演唱會的內地觀眾應及早購票和妥善計劃行程，使用港鐵或跨境巴士服務往返。

活動期間，體育園附近一帶的交通預期會較繁忙，觀眾應乘搭公共交通工具，避免駕駛或乘搭私家車（包括跨境私家車）前往。

運輸署已協調本地及跨境公共運輸服務營辦商在離場時段加強服務。港鐵將會加密屯馬綫的班次，專營巴士公司將於宋皇臺道上落客區提供共11條特別巴士路線分別前往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處、港珠澳大橋香港口岸和機場及港九新界各主要地區。

另外，園方將於離場時段安排跨境巴士服務，便利旅客經落馬洲／皇崗口岸、港珠澳大橋和深圳灣口岸返回內地。乘客需預先購票，離場後現場不設售票。票務詳情以營辦商網頁為準（永東直巴：www.myeebus.com/eebusfans；中旅巴士：m.hkctgbus.com/#/layout/home）。

至於的士服務，啟德主場館的士上落客區將開放予的士上落客。宋皇臺道上落客區在進場時段（下午四時至七時三十分）只開放予的士落客，離場時段則暫停的士上落客。由於預計離場人士眾多，輪候時間會較長，請耐心輪候登車。

計劃在演唱會完結後即日返回內地的觀眾需特別注意，如經羅湖口岸過關，需趕及港鐵屯馬綫最後一班相關列車，即於晚上十時五十九分由宋皇臺站及十一時○一分由啟德站開出的列車，並於大圍站轉乘東鐵綫往羅湖站。旅客應妥善規劃行程，提前前往車站月台。

使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸（全日24小時通關）過關的旅客，亦可乘搭東鐵綫往上水站轉乘九巴第276B或N73號線，或直接在宋皇臺道上落客區乘搭特別巴士第SP12號線往落馬洲（新田）公共運輸交匯處，轉乘落馬洲—皇崗過境穿梭巴士（皇巴）返回內地。

運輸署發言人表示，由於或有大量旅客在演唱會後使用落馬洲／皇崗口岸，加上八月十九及二十日晚上香港大球場亦會舉行足球賽事，預計該口岸將十分繁忙，請耐心等候過關。為確保公共交通服務暢順，活動期間午夜十二時後，落馬洲／皇崗口岸將按需要設公共交通專用通道，確保皇巴及跨境巴士行車暢通，更有效疏導大量跨境旅客；其他跨境私家車及其乘客輪候過關時間預計會較長。署方已督導相關營辦商預留足夠車輛和人手，應對乘客需求。

觀眾請留意場地廣播和「離場易」平台（easyleave.police.gov.hk）提供的實時資訊，以及經運輸署網頁（www.td.gov.hk）、「香港出行易」流動應用程式、電台和電視台發放的最新交通消息。"

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-08-13 06:45,2025-08-13 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/13/P2025081300008.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 13) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

DH investigates incident of RCHD administering COVID-19 vaccines beyond recommended use-by date,2025-08-12 20:00,2025-08-12 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200622.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) today (August 12) is investigating an incident involving a private doctor participating in the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme who administered COVID-19 vaccines that exceeded the recommended use-by date to seven residents of a residential care home for persons with disabilities (RCHD). The relevant COVID-19 vaccines have not exceeded their expiry dates, and none of the affected individuals reported feeling ill. The DH has requested that the affected institution and doctor concerned to take immediate remedial action to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents and to closely monitor the health conditions of the affected persons. The concerned doctor's vaccination service under the Vaccination Schemes has been suspended.

Upon reviewing the vaccine orders and vaccination records, the DH found that the doctor concerned administered Spikevax JN.1 COVID-19 vaccines that were beyond the recommended use-by date to seven residents at Hong Chi Fanling Integrative Rehabilitation Complex, an RCHD in Fanling, on May 22. While the COVID-19 vaccines concerned have not exceeded their expiry dates, they should be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius after thawing and used within 30 days, according to the manufacturer's recommendation.ã ãã

The DH is highly concerned about the incident and has taken immediate actions to follow up on the health conditions of the affected persons. It has been confirmed that none of the affected residents suffered from adverse events as a result of the vaccination. The DH has sought information from the vaccine manufacturer on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine under the above circumstances. Taking into account the history of COVID-19 vaccination and infection of the affected persons, the DH advised that there is no need for the affected individuals to be revaccinated. The DH has instructed the doctor in question to monitor the health conditions of the affected residents. At the request of the DH, the visiting doctor will explain the incident to the affected persons or their relatives and discuss subsequent arrangements.ã ãã

Meanwhile, the DH has inspected the RCHD concerned to check the storage of vaccines and vaccination procedures. To avoid the recurrence of similar incidents, the staff have been urged to follow the requirements of regular checking of the recommended use-by date of the vaccines, separate storage of vaccines with different recommended use-by dates, and timely disposal of expired vaccines in accordance with the guidelines of the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme.

The DH has suspended the vaccination service of the doctor concerned under the Vaccination Schemes and will continue to follow up on whether the institution concerned have complied with the relevant guidelines of the DH.

To remind private doctors and residential care home staff how to properly store and administer COVID-19 vaccines to the public, the DH conducted three briefing sessions for the industries in late July and early August. Participants included doctors participating in the Programme, staff members of RCHDs and residential care homes for the elderly. They were reminded of the key points to note when administering COVID-19 vaccines. The DH also stressed that the recommended use-by date must be checked before administering the vaccines for the public.

In response to this incident, the DH will send letters again to remind doctors participating in the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme to strictly adhere to all procedures recommended by the DH when providing vaccination services."
CFS urges public not to consume a prepackaged ice cream detected with coliform bacteria count exceeding legal limit,2025-08-12 19:32,2025-08-12 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200600.htm,"âThe Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (August 12) urged the public not to consume a kind of prepackaged coconut flavoured ice cream, which was found to contain coliform bacteria with its count exceeding the legal limit. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.

Details of the product are as follows:

Product name: Original Coconut Gelato
Brand: Make Meanings
Place of origin: Hong Kong
Net volume: 70ml
Best-before date: January 21, 2026
Manufacturer: Pay & Pay Ice Cream International Company Limited
Distributor: Cheung Wo Food Supply Company Limited

A spokesman for the CFS said, ""The CFS collected the above-mentioned sample from a vending machine in Tseung Kwan O for testing under its routine Food Surveillance Programme. The test result showed that the sample contained 140 coliform bacteria per gram, exceeding the legal limit.""

Under the Frozen Confections Regulation (Cap. 132AC), frozen confection for sale should not contain more than 100 coliform bacteria per gram. The maximum penalty for offenders is a fine of $10,000 and three months' imprisonment upon conviction. The fact that the coliform count exceeded the legal limit indicated that the hygienic conditions were unsatisfactory, but did not mean that consumption would lead to food poisoning.

  ""The CFS has informed the manufacturer and the operator of the vending machine concerned of the irregularity and instructed it to stop selling the affected ice-cream product immediately. The CFS has also immediately sent staff to the frozen confection factory concerned to conduct an investigation and took samples for testing. Health education on food safety and hygiene was provided to the person-in-charge and staff of the frozen confection factory concerned. They have also been requested to carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises,"" the spokesman said.

For the sake of prudence, the CFS has instructed the above-mentioned manufacturer to stop sales, remove from shelves the affected batch of the product and to initiate a recall. Members of the public may call the hotline at 5548 9226 during office hours for enquiries about the recall.

The spokesman advised members of the public to stop consuming the affected product and seek medical treatment if they feel unwell after consuming the product concerned.

âThe CFS has alerted the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. An investigation is ongoing."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-08-12 19:20,2025-08-12 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200578.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (August 12), one new imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The CHP reminded members of the public to maintain strict environmental hygiene and to take mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Those who suspect they may be infected with CF should seek medical advice promptly and avoid self-testing, which can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Latest case information

The new case involves a 31-year-old male with good past health who lives in Kwai Tsing District. Preliminary investigations revealed that he travelled to Foshan in Guangdong Province from August 1 to 3. He could not confirm whether he had a history of mosquito bites. Upon returning to Hong Kong, he developed a fever, rash and joint pain on August 8. He travelled to Shenzhenon August 9 and attended a hospital there the next day. He was not admitted and returned to Hong Kong on the same day. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Yan Chai Hospital yesterday (August 11) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is currently in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

 Since the patient stayed in Foshan during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel, and the case was classified as imported. The patient has no travel collaterals and his household contacts are currently asymptomatic and are under medical surveillance. The CHP will continue its epidemiological investigation and has reported the case to the health authorities of Guangdong.

 Hong Kong has recorded a total of six confirmed CF cases this year, all of which are imported cases, as well as one probable case. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

""According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, in the past week (August 3 to 9), there were 1 387 new CF cases in Guangdong, a significant decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 2 892 cases (July 27 to August 2) and 2 940 cases (July 20 to 26) respectively. All the cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. However, we must remain vigilant and continue to adopt a multipronged approach to prevent local transmission,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

The CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screening for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms, and refer them to hospitals for follow up when necessary.

To raise the awareness among the elderly about preventing CF, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising the elderly on CF prevention and travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. They have also reminded residential care homes for the elderly to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of CF.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (including Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite.

 Dr Tsui reminded members of the public, currently, there are no rapid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for public use in self-testing for CF. They should promptly seek medical advice if they suspect they are infected with CF and not to conduct testing on their own as this may delay proper clinical treatment. He also urged the public not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example, increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms because it may lead to ""Reye's syndrome"", a serious and potentially fatal complication.

He also added that members of the public should adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can effectively prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 andpicaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


In addition, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
衞生署調查殘疾人士院舍接種超出建議使用日期新冠疫苗,2025-08-12 19:00,2025-08-12 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200579.htm,"​衞生署今日（八月十二日）正調查一名參與新冠疫苗接種計劃的私家醫生為七名殘疾人士院舍院友接種超出建議使用日期新冠疫苗的事件，相關新冠疫苗並未超出其有效日期，受影響的人士均沒有不適。衞生署已要求涉事院舍和醫生立即改善疫苗管理措施以避免類似事件發生，並須密切跟進受影響人士的健康情況。涉事醫生亦已被暫停在疫苗接種計劃下的服務。

衞生署在核對疫苗預訂及接種紀錄時，發現涉事醫生於五月二十二日到粉嶺一間名為「匡智粉嶺綜合復康中心」的殘疾人士院舍提供疫苗接種服務時，為七名院友接種了超過建議使用日期的莫德納JN.1新冠疫苗。雖然相關新冠疫苗並未超出有效日期，但根據疫苗製造商的建議，該疫苗須於解凍後儲存於攝氏2至8度，並於30日內使用。

衞生署高度關注事件，已即時跟進受影響人士的健康情況，並確定所有受影響的院友均沒有因為接種疫苗而出現不良情況。衞生署亦已向疫苗製造商了解疫苗在上述情況下的安全和效能等資料。經詳細考慮受影響人士的新冠疫苗接種及新冠感染史，衞生署建議受影響人士無需重新接種疫苗，並已指示涉事醫生監察受影響人士的健康狀況，而該名醫生亦會按衞生署要求，向受影響人士或其家屬解釋事件及商討其後安排。

另一方面，衞生署已巡查涉事殘疾人士院舍，檢查疫苗儲存及接種程序，並督促職員必須定時檢查疫苗的建議使用日期、分開存放不同建議使用日期的疫苗，以及按照2019冠狀病毒病疫苗接種計劃指引適時處置已過期的疫苗，避免同類事件再發生。

衞生署已暫停涉事醫生在疫苗接種計劃下的疫苗接種服務，並會繼續跟進涉事院舍是否有遵從相關指引。

為提醒私家醫生和院舍負責人員如何妥善存放和為市民接種新冠疫苗，衞生署已於七月底和八月初向業界舉辦三場簡報會，提醒參與計劃的醫生、殘疾人士院舍及安老院舍的員工為市民接種新冠疫苗必須注意的事項，並強調為市民接種新冠疫苗前必須先檢查相關疫苗的建議使用日期。

因應今次事件，衞生署會再去信提醒所有參與新冠疫苗接種計劃的醫生，提供疫苗接種服務時須恪守衞生署建議的所有程序。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-08-12 18:35,2025-08-12 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200554.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（八月十二日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。中心提醒市民，不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於葵青區的31歲男子，他過往健康良好。初步調查顯示，他於八月一日至三日到過廣東省佛山市，未能確定自己曾否被蚊叮。他回港後，於八月八日起出現發燒、皮疹及關節痛。他於八月九日到深圳市，翌日到當地一間醫院求診，無須留醫，並於同日回港。他昨日（八月十一日）到仁濟醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院，在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人潛伏期身處佛山市，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人沒有其他同行人士，他的家居接觸者現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得六宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，均屬輸入個案，以及一宗可能個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三日至九日）廣東省新增1 387宗基孔肯雅熱個案，與過去兩周分別為2 892宗（七月二十七日至八月二日）及2 940宗（七月二十日至二十六日）明顯減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然如此，我們仍不能掉以輕心，必須繼續多管齊下，避免出現本地傳播。」

中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

為加強長者對預防基孔肯雅熱的意識，衞生署長者健康服務的外展分隊透過在長者地區中心及長者鄰舍中心舉行的講座，向長者講解預防基孔肯雅熱及提供外遊健康建議，並提醒安老院舍加強防控蚊患措施。衞生署轄下的母嬰健康院、學生健康服務中心及健康評估中心亦會提醒孕婦、嬰幼兒照顧者、學生有關基孔肯雅熱的症狀和預防措施。

為加強對少數族裔的支援，有關基孔肯雅熱的重要資訊亦已翻譯成十種少數族裔語言（包括印度語、尼泊爾語、巴基斯坦語、泰語、印尼語、他加祿語、越南語、旁遮普語、僧伽羅語及孟加拉語）並上載至衞生防護中心網站（www.chp.gov.hk/tc/static/104022.html）。

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，目前，市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證的快速測試產品，供市民自行測試基孔肯雅熱。若懷疑感染基孔肯雅熱，應立即就醫，不應自行進行檢測，以免延誤診治。市民亦不應自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

他補充，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食物環境衞生署（食環署）呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

Chinese Film Panorama 2025 presents Mainland films of diverse styles (with photos),2025-08-12 18:20,2025-08-12 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200341.htm,"  The Chinese Film Panorama 2025, jointly presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and the Southern Film Culture Foundation, will be held from September 10 to October 29. Twelve films produced on the Mainland with a variety of styles and themes will be screened, and two of the films were selected for free screenings for public appreciation.

  The opening film, ""Always Have Always Will"" (2025), follows a man with hard luck unexpectedly going on a road trip full of laughter and tears with a quirky young girl, bringing a glimmer of light into each other's gloomy lives.

  ""Enjoy Yourself"" (2024) tells the story of a divorced couple crossing paths with an older couple who have lost their only child, exploring the balance between love and letting go. Depicting the absurdities of the adult world through a child's perspective, ""Day Dreaming"" (2024) is the story of the fantasies of a mischievous transfer student Zhu Tong becoming reality, setting off a chain of bizarre events. In ""Brief History of A Family"" (2024), the seemingly happy life of a middle-class family of three is disrupted by the arrival of a teenager. In the guise of a suspense thriller, the film depicts the impacts faced by families in a modern world. Using an unconventional narrative and structure, ""Land of Broken Hearts"" (2024) depicts the journey of delicate love between two imperfect urban youths, from confrontation to mutual understanding.

  ""Viva La Vida"" (2024) follows a young man and a young woman, both suffering from serious illnesses, entering a contract to carry each other through the final days of their lives. Seasoned with humour, the film shows the tenacity and stoicism of humanity. Based on a true story, ""Stand By Me"" (2024) tells the story of a street youth and an orphan looking out for each other to survive their cruel reality while growing up side by side.

He met with the Chinese Ambassador to Singapore, Mr Cao Zhongming, and engaged in discussions with the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS).

During the meeting with Mr Cao, Professor Lo introduced him to the latest healthcare developments in Hong Kong. Professor Lo said, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is pressing ahead with the healthcare reform and incorporating the concept of co-ordinated development of healthcare services, healthcare protection and drugs into the reform framework to tie in with the national healthcare reform direction.

  ""On healthcare services, we are committed to advancing the primary healthcare development, as well as reforming the governance and structure of the Hospital Authority (HA) to enhance the quality and efficiency of public healthcare services. On drugs, we have put forward the vision of moving towards 'primary evaluation' through reforming the approval and registration mechanism for drugs and medical devices. To this end, we have implemented the '1+' mechanism for approval of new drugs and enhanced the arrangements for introduction and procurement of drugs and medical devices for public healthcare. As for healthcare protection, the Public Healthcare Fees and Charges Reform jointly announced by the Health Bureau and the HA in March this year will not only restructure the subsidisation levels for various services in a precise manner but will also enhance healthcare protection, thereby providing Hong Kong citizens with a larger, more stable, thicker and denser public healthcare safety net.""

The delegation then met with the CRIS. Professor Lo said, ""The Chief Executive announced relevant strategies to develop Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub in his 2023 and 2024 Policy Addresses. The HKSAR Government will leverage the advantages of the Hong Kong Park of the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, and jointly establish a one-stop clinical trial collaboration platform through the synergistic collaboration between the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute located in the Hong Kong Park and the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trials Center located in the Shenzhen Park. Furthermore, the HKSAR Government will establish the Real-World Study and Application Centre by the end of this year to provide real-world data support for the approval of drugs and medical devices.

Inclusion of etomidate under voluntary testing of Healthy School Programme,2025-08-12 18:00,2025-08-12 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200347.htm,"The Narcotics Division (ND)of the Security Bureau today (August 12) said that it has written to schools to confirm the inclusion of etomidate in the voluntary drug testing under the Healthy School Programme in the 2025/26 school year.

  The ND today met with non-governmental organisations responsible for administering the drug tests to work out the details of etomidate testing under the Healthy School Programme. The procedures for etomidate testing will follow that of other drugs - participating schools may opt for rapid urine tests or hair tests under the current testing procedures, and testing will only be conducted after receiving a student's consent. Personal data collected during the voluntary testing are protected under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486). The testing procedures and implementation details can be found in the updated ""Reference Protocol for the School Drug Testing Scheme"" (www.nd.gov.hk/en/HSP.html).

The Healthy School Programme, supported by the Beat Drugs Fund, is a school-based anti-drug education initiative. The Programme is divided into two parts, including diversified personal growth activities and voluntary school drug testing by students. It aims to enhance students' resolve to stay away from drugs, establish a drug-free culture in schools, and encourage those in need to seek help. Currently, more than half of Hong Kong's secondary schools participate in the Programme. Apart from etomidate, the voluntary school testing covers drugs including ketamine, ecstasy, methylamphetamine, cannabis, and cocaine. The Programme incorporates comprehensive downstream support programmes, which include counselling, treatment, rehabilitation and referral services to handle and follow up on relevant cases.

The ND will continue to closely communicate with schools and testing teams of non-governmental organisations and review the operation of the Healthy School Programme from time to time in response to prevailing drug trends. For enquiries about the Programme, the ND can be reached by phone at 2867 5974/2867 5975/2867 5976 or by email at sb-hspdt@sb.gov.hk."

Man convicted and jailed for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and obstructing Customs officers in exercise of power (with photos),2025-08-12 17:50,2025-08-12 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/12/P2025081200524.htm,"A local man was sentenced to 250 days' imprisonment at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (August 12) for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and obstructing Customs officers in the exercise of power, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Customs and Excise Service Ordinance.

Customs intercepted a 38-year-old man who was pulling a pallet of cargo with a pallet truck for inspection at the Chung Ying Street Checkpoint in Sha Tau Kok on May 12. During customs clearance, the man failed to obey the lawful order of the Customs officers, and a total of 280 200 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from 24 styrofoam boxes of the consignment. The man was thus arrested. The estimated market value of the batch of duty-not-paid cigarettes was about $1.4 million, and the duty potential was about $926,000. 

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

 Upon arrival, Mr Yau had a lunch meeting with representatives of the New Zealand Winegrowers to learn about the latest developments in the local wine industry and explore further collaboration between Hong Kong and New Zealand on wine and liquor promotion.

 Mr Yau shared with them Hong Kong's advantages as a wine and liquor trading hub and its recent reduction of liquor duty by introducing a two-tier liquor duty system to encourage the trade and auctions of high-end liquor. This strategic policy adjustment is part of Hong Kong's efforts to strengthen its position as an international trading hub and create a more business-friendly environment for both domestic and international companies including New Zealand ones.

 Between 2013 and 2023, imports of spirits in Asia grew by almost 80 per cent, a significantly faster rate than the global increase of 42 per cent in the same period. The Mainland is now one of the largest importers of spirits. Mr Yau said that with Hong Kong's strategic location and unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, the city is the best two-way platform for New Zealand's wine and liquor trade to tap into the fast-growing Asian and Mainland markets.

 In the afternoon, Mr Yau met with representatives of the New Zealand China Council and the Auckland Business Chamber respectively to update them on Hong Kong's latest developments, such as the Northern Metropolis development, and initiatives to attract enterprises and investment around the globe. They also exchanged views on forging business co-operation between Hong Kong and New Zealand and using Hong Kong as a gateway to explore the vast market of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

 In the evening, Mr Yau attended the Hong Kong Dinner cohosted by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade office, Sydney and the Hong Kong New Zealand Business Association. Speaking at the dinner, Mr Yau highlighted the close economic ties between Hong Kong and New Zealand since the signing of the free trade agreement between the two places in 2010. Today, Hong Kong stands as one of New Zealand's key trading partners in Asia. In 2024, New Zealand exported NZ$16 billion worth of goods and services to Hong Kong.

 Mr Yau said that the synergy between Hong Kong's service-oriented economy and New Zealand's world-renowned expertise in food and agriculture has created opportunities that go far beyond simple imports and exports, adding that the dynamic and resilient partnership will continue to evolve and thrive.

 Mr Yau will proceed to Sydney, Australia, tomorrow (August 13)."

丘應樺抵埗後，隨即與新西蘭葡萄種植與葡萄酒釀造協會的代表進行午餐會議，了解當地葡萄酒業界的最新發展，並探討加強香港與新西蘭就推廣葡萄酒及烈酒的合作。

丘應樺向協會代表介紹香港作為葡萄酒及烈酒貿易樞紐的優勢，以及最近透過引進雙層烈酒稅制調低烈酒稅，以促進高價值烈酒貿易拍賣的舉措。該項策略性政策調整反映香港致力鞏固其作為國際貿易中心的地位，並為本地及國際企業，包括新西蘭企業創造更友善的營商環境。

在二○一三年至二○二三年期間，亞洲進口烈酒產品錄得約80%增幅，遠較同期全球增長42%急速。內地已成為最大烈酒進口地之一。丘應樺說，憑藉香港的戰略位置和在「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢，是新西蘭葡萄酒及烈酒業界進軍正急速發展的亞洲及內地市場的最佳雙向平台。

丘應樺下午分別與新西蘭—中國關係促進委員會和奧克蘭商會的代表會面，介紹香港的最新發展，包括北部都會區發展，以及吸引環球企業和投資的措施。他們亦就加強香港與新西蘭的商貿合作，以及利用香港作為門戶以開拓粵港澳大灣區龐大市場交換意見。

The DPO will fully support the secure and stable operation of the relevant information systems, ensuring the smooth operation of the Games with the result-oriented goal of achieving ""zero cybersecurity risk and zero interruption to the operation of events"".

  Professor Sun held a working meeting with the DPO, during which he was briefed on the progress in system development, cybersecurity protection and contingency exercises. He pointed out that the application of innovation and technology is key to raising the operational standards of large-scale sports events in the face of increasingly severe cybersecurity challenges. He encouraged the team to press ahead with the goal, in particular refining various contingency plans, with professionalism and a careful and stringent approach, to provide stable, efficient and secure technical support to the Games.

  The Commissioner for Digital Policy, Mr Tony Wong, said that cybersecurity is one of the primary focuses of this IT infrastructure initiative. Drawing on the experiences of the Asian Games and the Asian Winter Games, the IT infrastructure adopts the principle of ""respond instantly, recover rapidly"" and combines multi-layered cybersecurity protection and monitoring with a comprehensive contingency plan to ensure ""zero interruption""to the Games. The development of the relevant IT systems of the Games was gradually completed in June, and work including high-intensity stress tests, security tests, red team exercises, and emergency response drills is under way to ensure the safe and smooth operation of the systems.

  The DPO has been providing IT support to the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) in planning and building the core IT systems and network infrastructure for the Hong Kong competition region. It has started testing and contingency drills in phases. Starting from August, the DPO will launch multiple rounds of joint system testing and live exercises with Guangdong and Macao counterparts to ensure seamless system connectivity, smooth operation of network and data flow across the three places, while further enhancing cross-boundary co-ordination and emergency response capabilities in system operations and cybersecurity to make preparations for the upcoming competitions."

Customs officers intercepted the incoming female passenger, aged 48, at Hong Kong International Airport on June 4. About 43 800 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $179,000 and a duty potential of about $145,000, were seized from her personal baggage. She was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
