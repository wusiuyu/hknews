Speech by FS at Toast to Success: Hong Kong Top Travel Agent Awards Celebration & Gala Dinner of 2025 Wine and Dine Festival (English only) (with photos),2025-10-25 20:48,2025-10-25 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/25/P2025102500572.htm,"Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Toast to Success: Hong Kong Top Travel Agent Awards Celebration & Gala Dinner of 2025 Wine and Dine Festival today (October 25):

Michael (Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong), Rosanna (Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law), Peter (Chairman of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Dr Peter Lam), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good evening.

  A very warm welcome to the Tasting Room, and the Hong Kong Wine & Dine Festival, a world of fabulous dining and imbibing, day and night. I hope you brought your appetite. This gala evening features an eight-course dinner with splendid wine pairings, from Bordeaux and Xinjiang's Turpan Valley.

  For that, and a great deal more, my thanks to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. As Peter noted, tonight is about more than fine wine and culinary magic. It's also a celebration of collaboration, of connection.

  On this good evening, I'm pleased to welcome leaders from the financial and business sectors, as well as MICE (meetings, incentive travels, conventions and exhibitions) partners from around the world. Each of you shares a passion for excellence and the promise of partnership. That creates an ideal setting to make new friends, build lasting ties and look to Hong Kong for your future.

  The momentum in our tourism sector is truly encouraging. In the first nine months of this year, we welcomed over 36 million visitors from around the world, up 12 per cent year on year. And the number of international visitors increased by 16 percent. MICE is the fastest recovering segment.

  Visitors added more than HK$11 billion to our economy Ì¶ a clear testament to the value and impact of hosting business events here.

  More than a pillar of the economy, tourism brings our city's story to dazzling life, life you can see and experience, first-hand, for yourself.

  Hong Kong is the events capital of Asia for good reason. This year alone, our calendar is packed with more than 200 major events. We expect they will attract some 2.3 million visitors, generating over US$1 billion in spending.

  Beyond business, our city features a wide and welcome range of arts and culture, sports, entertainment and other leisure events throughout the year. The Wine & Dine Festival is a prime example, a happy celebration of Hong Kong's unique East-meets-West culture. An enticing opportunity, too, to experience another side of Hong Kong – one that is festive, fun and full of delicious surprise.

  We're working to create a continuing buzz, one great, city-wide festival that never ends. Our goal is simple - to give visitors reason after remarkable reason to stay longer, explore deeper, spend more and keep coming back.

  And we're building for the future, locking in long-term partnerships to ensure that these signature events become an essential part of Hong Kong's story.

  Our new, multi-year deal with LIV Golf, for example, brings the world's top golfers, and their fans, right here to our city.

  We're also deepening our collaboration with Art Basel, reinforcing Hong Kong's role as the region's exclusive host city for the high-profile arts extravaganza.

  It's also part of our ""Tourism is Everywhere"" drive, one we're bringing to bright life, leveraging the city's distinctive culture, creativity and energy to attract visitors from around the world. And each of you plays an important role in realising that ambitious goal.

  I invite you to become our ""Tourism Ambassadors"", helping us share the authentic and inspiring story of Hong Kong.

  Ladies and gentlemen, dinner is just a few minutes away. I wish you all a memorable evening and a delightful stay here in Hong Kong, Asia's World City and event capital. Culinary capital, too!

  And for our local friends, please mark your diary for another event - the Legislative Council election on December 7. It is an important moment for our future.

  Thank you very much."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-25 19:14,2025-10-25 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/25/P2025102500620.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十五日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

首宗個案涉及一名74歲女子，住所位於九龍城區。初步調查顯示，她於十月三日至十三日到訪廣東省佛山市。她於十月二十日出現關節痛及皮疹。她昨日（十月二十四日）到廣華醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。她的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。病人目前情況穩定。

她有一名家居接觸者，曾一同到佛山市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

另一宗個案涉及一名72歲男子，住所位於沙田區。初步調查顯示，他於十月十日至二十三日獨自到訪廣東省佛山市。他於十月二十三日出現發燒、關節痛及皮疹。他昨日到威爾斯親王醫院急症室求醫，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。

他有一名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於兩名病人在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得46宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。當中一名患者死亡，其餘患者病況輕微。

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

​市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-25 19:14,2025-10-25 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/25/P2025102500619.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 25), two new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

 The first case involves a 74-year-old female living in Kowloon City District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Foshan in Guangdong between October 3 and 13. She developed joint pain and rash since October 20. She sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital yesterday (October 24) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. Her blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient is now in stable condition.

 The patient has one household contact, who travelled with her to Foshan, is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 The other case involves a 72-year-old male living in Shatin District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Foshan in Guangdong alone between October 10 and 23. He developed a fever, joint pain and rash since October 23. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince of Wales Hospital yesterday and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. His blood sample tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. The patient is now in stable condition.

 The patient has one household contact, who is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since both patients stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation period, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

Latest surveillance data

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 46 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. Among which, a patient passed away, while conditions of other patients are mild.

  Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and opposes US politicians interfering in HK affairs under pretext of Lai Chee-ying's case,2025-10-25 18:53,2025-10-25 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/25/P2025102500593.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (October 25) strongly disapproved of and opposed recent remarks by individual members of the United States (US) Senate Committee on Foreign Relations regarding the case endangering national security involving Lai Chee-ying and the treatment provided to him during his custody, including absurd and fact-twisting comments intended to pervert the course of justice. Their malicious intentions to smear and attack the HKSAR Government and challenge the bottom line of the ""one country, two systems"" principle are blatantly obvious and must be sternly denounced to set the record straight.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""The HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that as the legal proceedings involving Lai Chee-ying are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the case in an attempt to interfere with the court to exercise judicial power independently, which might otherwise constitute perverting the course of justice. The suggestion that any persons or organisations with certain backgrounds should be immune from legal sanctions for their illegal acts and activities is tantamount to granting such persons privileges to break the law and is totally contrary to the spirit of the rule of law. External forces continue to distort the truth, blatantly discredit the judicial system and trials of the HKSAR, in an attempt to glorify criminal behavior and exert pressure on the courts of the HKSAR. The HKSAR Government strongly urges relevant US politicians to respect the basic principles of the rule of law and judicial independence and immediately stop the above despicable political manipulation.

The spokesman said, ""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support will be provided. If inmates require further examination and treatment, they will be referred to specialist medical staff or to public hospitals for further follow-up. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected. The CSD also adopts the above arrangements when handling matters related to Lai Chee-ying, which are no different from those applicable to other PICs.

""During an earlier open court hearing, senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that the correctional institutions arrange daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical care he receives there. The Court commended the CSD while the Department of Justice stated that the prosecution is equally concerned about Lai Chee-ying's health and well-being. Therefore, the CSD has arranged for a professional medical team to be on standby on the spot, ready to respond to any emergency immediately if needed. External forces and anti-China media chose to turn a blind eye to these facts, and continued to repeat lies and engage in despicable operations. We must sternly denounce their wrongdoings.

""We must once again point out the fact that the arrangement for Lai Chee-ying's removal from association from other PICs has all along been made at his own request and approved by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law. The remarks by these external forces regarding Lai Chee-ying's solitary confinement are completely fact-twisting, reflecting a malicious intention to smear and attack the HKSAR Government.

""The HKSAR will continue to resolutely discharge the responsibility of safeguarding national security, effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities that endanger national security in accordance with the law, and safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people in accordance with the law at the same time. The HKSAR Government strongly urges all external forces to immediately stop interfering in the HKSAR's internal affairs and the independent exercise of judicial power by the courts of the HKSAR,"" the spokesman emphasised."

特區政府強烈不滿及反對美國政客借黎智英案干預香港事務,2025-10-25 18:32,2025-10-25 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/25/P2025102500581.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十月二十五日）對美國國會參議院外交關係委員會個別議員近日持續就黎智英涉及危害國家安全的案件，以及就其羈管安排說三道四，更作出種種顛倒是非的荒謬評論，意圖妨礙司法公正，表示強烈不滿及反對。他們污衊和攻擊特區政府，挑戰「一國兩制」的原則底線的險惡用心昭然若揭，必須嚴厲直斥其非，以正視聽。

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府已多次強調，由於黎智英案所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不應評論有關案件以圖干預法院獨立進行審判，否則可能構成妨礙司法公正。倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。外部勢力仍繼續顛倒是非、公然抹黑香港特區的司法制度和審訊，企圖美化犯罪行為及向特區法院施壓，特區政府強烈敦促相關美國政客，尊重法治精神和司法獨立等基本準則，並立即停止上述卑劣政治操弄。」

「在早前的公開法庭聆訊中，代表黎智英的資深大律師向法庭清楚表明，懲教院所為黎智英每日安排醫療檢查，且對黎智英在懲教院所內獲得的醫療服務沒有任何投訴，法官表示懲教署值得稱讚，而律政司表示控方同樣關心黎智英的健康和福祉，因此懲教署已安排專業的醫療團隊在場隨時待命，準備好即時應對突發情況。外部勢力和反華媒體對這些事實視而不見，繼續重複謊言和作出卑劣操作，我們必須直斥其非。」

「我們必須再次指出事實，有關黎智英與其他囚犯中止交往的安排，一直是根據黎智英本人的意願並由懲教署經考慮所有相關因素後依法安排的。這些反華勢力企圖藉黎智英被單獨監禁一事作出失實言論，攻擊特區政府，用心險惡。」

發言人強調：「香港特區會繼續堅定不移地履行維護國家安全的責任，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由。特區政府強烈敦促所有外部勢力立即停止干預特區的內部事務和特區法院獨立行使的審判權。」"

The LD will continue to enhance occupational safety through inspections, enforcement, publicity and promotion, as well as education and training. He also took the opportunity to urge eligible voters to cast their ballots in the Legislative Council Elections on December 7, selecting capable and competent representatives who can contribute to Hong Kong's occupational safety standards and the city's prosperity.

At the seminar, a representative of the LD outlined the safety legislations on OSH, while a representative of the OSHC introduced various sponsorship schemes for small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) and OSH Star Enterprise Schemes, encouraging all SMEs across Hong Kong to participate and proactively improve their OSH practices.

大家下午好！很開心，大家應該跟我一樣，滿懷期待和興奮來到今日AllRightsReserved舉行的「維港海上大巡遊」開幕典禮。因為上個月這些IP（知識產權）前來香港的時候，應該是有些風雨，但大家都會前往拍照，所以都很開心和期待。我曾經在很多其他場合說過，近年香港文化及知識產權熱潮席捲全球，成為推動文化和旅遊發展的重要動力。特區政府一直積極把握這股潮流，與業界攜手推動文藝創意產業的蓬勃發展。除了文體旅局（文化體育及旅遊局）外，其實不同政策局及部門亦同心協力為盛事的主辦機構及業界提供全方位支援，為市民和訪港旅客帶來不同類型、具吸引力的文化旅遊盛事。

今個夏天，我估大家跟我一樣參觀了ARR主辦的「CHIIKAWA DAYS」的大型特展，那時的氣氛跟今日的天氣一樣熾熱，不單香港市民，其實來自世界各地的旅客和粉絲，都專程到訪香港參與盛事。今次ARR再下一城，設計及籌辦這個全球首創、雲集世界知名IP的「維港海上大巡遊」，將來自不同地方的人氣IP結合世界知名的維多利亞海港美景，以得意可愛的流行文化元素突顯香港繽紛多彩和創意活力，再次展示香港作為國際盛事之都的吸引力。巨型充氣雕塑由今日開始於添馬公園對出跟大家見面，配合融合IP特色的快閃店、主題餐飲及互動遊戲體驗的巡遊市集，剛才我們也玩了一些遊戲，其實頗困難，但回報卻很大，所以我想鼓勵大家試試。而萬眾期待的巨型充氣雕塑海上大巡遊，剛才SK也提到，下星期六，即十一月一日就會進行。我期待世界各地的朋友都親身來港參與這次活動，盡情打卡，親身感受香港獨特多元的魅力。

旅遊與文化互相交織，彼此帶動。未來，我們期望社會各界與一眾本地及國際藝術家繼續攜手合作，百花齊放，讓更多融合獨特IP元素的活動在香港落地生根。我們亦會繼續與不同主辦單位合作，帶來更多不同類型、具吸引力的文化旅遊盛事，為旅客帶來嶄新而難忘的體驗，亦令香港的文化旅遊發展更上一層樓。

在此，容許我作兩個呼籲，一個呼籲是在旁邊舉行的美酒佳餚巡禮，今日是第三日，會一直營業至深夜，越夜越繽紛，希望大家逛完IP展後，順便前往美酒佳餚巡禮。第二個呼籲是二○二五年立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行。在此誠邀各位積極投票，選出愛國愛港、具有能力、有志服務香港的優秀人才，跟我們一起同創美好明天。

最後，我衷心祝願「維港海上大巡遊」活動圓滿成功。多謝大家。"
