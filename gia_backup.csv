LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-27 10:50,2025-07-27 11:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700274.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"

DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-07-27 06:46,2025-07-27 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/27/P2025072700019.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (July 27) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" said the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

The case involved a 34-year-old male passenger arriving in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand yesterday. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds, concealed inside 28 vacuum bags in his check-in suitcase. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested man has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts on Monday (July 28).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
FEHD implements multi-pronged mosquito control measures and urges public vigilance against chikungunya fever (with photos),2025-07-26 18:20,2025-07-26 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600660.htm,"In response to the recent surge in chikungunya fever cases reported in neighbouring regions and some overseas countries, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has stepped up mosquito prevention and control efforts through a multi-pronged approach. The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to strengthen anti-mosquito measures. The FEHD and the Department of Health will meet and collaborate with the stakeholders from the property management sector to enhance mosquito control work.

Chikungunya fever is a mosquito-borne disease. To safeguard public health, the FEHD is implementing the following measures:


Convening meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts. Members of the task force include relevant departments and stakeholders. Targeted and sustained mosquito control actions will be carried out at locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, based on the latest Gravidtrap Index for Aedes albopictusï¼
Collaborating with departments such as the Housing Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department to strengthen inspections in public areas, public housing estates and parks. Upon detection of mosquito breeding grounds, immediate actions will be taken, including conducting fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes, removal of stagnant water and water-holding containers, application of larvicides (e.g. temephos sand granules), and installation of mosquito traps;
Enhancing inspections at construction sites, works areas and private residences. Enforcement actions will be taken against violations involving mosquito breeding;
Issuing letters and organising seminars for property management companies and organisations to disseminate the latest information on chikungunya fever and mosquito prevention. The FEHD also invites the Housing Department and property management companies to conduct mosquito control campaigns in housing estates and encourages resident participation;
Working with the District Offices to assist in mosquito prevention and control at locations with infestation issues, such as ""three-nil"" buildings; and
Strengthening public education and publicity through promotional videos, posters and leaflets to remind the public to adopt mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also enhance dissemination of the Area Gravidtrap Index for Aedes albopictus to raise awareness in districts with higher readings.


Public participation is crucial in addition to the government and the trade's efforts. Members of the public are urged to continue joining hands in taking mosquito prevention and control measures at home and other places promptly. The measures include:


Keep the environment clean by disposing of rubbish properly. Refuse like empty cans and food containers where water can accumulate easily should be disposed of in covered litter containers;
Clean the saucers under potted plants weekly and prevent water accumulation;
Change the water in vases and scrub their internal surface every week;
Keep water-storage containers, such as buckets and basins, tightly covered; and
Check umbrella stands, umbrella tubes and air-conditioner drip trays to prevent any water accumulation.


The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management companies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the water accumulation. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergents at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the Centre for Health Protection's thematic webpage: www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/109029.html for more information on chikungunya fever."

The 2nd Zhejiang-Hong Kong Modern Professional Services Cooperation Conference, themed ""Innovation and integration for development, advancing modernisation together"", was held this morning. The conference brought together government officials, industry leaders and representatives of professional organisations from Zhejiang and Hong Kong to foster collaboration between the two places in various professional fields, including technology, finance and maritime services, facilitating in-depth integration of technological and industrial innovation to contribute to the country's modernisation.

Four thematic forums were held in the afternoon. Speaking at the thematic forum on port and maritime services, Mr Liu said that both Zhejiang and Hong Kong are important shipping hubs of the country. As an international shipping centre ranking the fourth globally, Hong Kong has a highly open shipping market, a unique and bilingual common law system, and an internationalised professional service network. The joint development of Zhejiang and Hong Kong would further contribute to the country's strategic goal of developing into a strong maritime nation. He also listed out a series of recent breakthroughs in Hong Kong's high-end maritime services and green maritime transformation under the policy support of the country as well as the concerted effort of the industry and the Government. These include the recent outstanding achievements of the fleet of Hong Kong-registered ships in the International Maritime Organization Member State Audit Scheme; the 10 per cent increase in the number of port and maritime service companies in Hong Kong compared to five years ago; as well as the completion of several green fuel-bunkering operations in Hong Kong. He encouraged Zhejiang enterprises to consider making use of Hong Kong's highly internationalised and top-quality maritime services as an ideal springboard for entering the international market to collaboratively contribute to the high-quality development of the country's maritime industry.

At the thematic forum on port and maritime services, representatives of industry organisations and enterprises from both Zhejiang and Hong Kong shared insights and engaged in discussions on key topics, such as ship finance, green maritime transition and maritime law and arbitration. They explored collaboration opportunities to jointly enhance Hong Kong's status as an international maritime centre and strengthen the integrated service capacity of the Ningbo Zhoushan Port.

Mr Liu will visit the Chuanshan Port Area, the Ningbo Zhoushan Port, and the exhibition gallery of the Ningbo Area, China (Zhejiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone, tomorrow (July 27), to discuss experiences of container terminal operations and intermodal transport developments. He will return to Hong Kong in the afternoon."

在各分區召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」會議。專責小組成員包括各相關部門和持分者，將根據最新的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，對各區蚊患風險較高的地點採取具針對性和持久性的防蚊滅蚊行動；
聯同房屋署及康文署等不同部門在公共地方、公共屋邨、公園等加強巡查，如發現蚊子滋生地，會即時採取行動，包括進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊、清除積水及儲水容器、施用殺幼蟲劑（例如蚊沙）、增設蚊子陷阱等；
加強巡查建築地盤及工地，以及私人住宅，對發現蚊子滋生的違規情況採取執法行動；
通過向物業管理公司及組織發信及舉辦講座，向物業管理業界講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況及防蚊資訊。此外，邀請房屋署及物業管理公司在屋邨及屋苑進行滅蚊運動，並鼓勵居民參與；
聯同各區民政事務處，協助有蚊蟲滋生情況的地方如三無大廈進行防蚊滅蚊工作；
持續加強公眾教育及宣傳，通過宣傳短片、海報及單張等途徑，提醒市民採取措施防治蚊患。此外，加強發布各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，提高指數較高地區市民的防蚊意識。


除政府及業界的努力，市民大眾的參與亦至關重要。食環署呼籲市民繼續攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括：


保持環境衞生，妥善棄置垃圾，特別是空罐和飯盒等容易積水的廢物應置於有蓋的垃圾桶內；
每星期清洗花盆底碟及避免積水；
每星期更換花瓶內的水及洗刷花瓶內壁；
蓋好水桶、水盆等貯水容器；及
檢查雨傘架、雨傘筒和冷氣機托盤，避免出現積水。


此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823。有關更多基孔肯雅熱的資訊，請瀏覽衞生署衞生防護中心的基孔肯雅熱專題網頁：www.chp.gov.hk/tc/features/109029.html。"
一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-07-26 15:32,2025-07-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600543.htm,"​一名入境男旅客因管有未完稅香煙及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》，今日（七月二十六日）在九龍城裁判法院被判處監禁六個月及罰款八百元。

海關人員昨日（七月二十五日）在香港國際機場截查一名十八歲的抵港男旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲四萬二千五百八十七支未完稅香煙，估計市值約十七萬五千元，應課稅值約十四萬一千元。該名抵港男旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民，根據《應課稅品條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若進口、處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
An incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-07-26 15:32,2025-07-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600546.htm,"âAn incoming male passenger was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment and fined $800 at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts today (July 26) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the 18-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (July 25) and seized 42 587 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of about $175,000 and a duty potential of about $141,000 from his personal baggage. He was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
商經局局長在寧波出席第二屆浙港現代專業服務合作會議（附圖）,2025-07-26 15:30,2025-07-26 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600251.htm,"商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺今日（七月二十六日）在浙江寧波出席第二屆浙港現代專業服務合作會議，促進兩地專業服務領域的合作，優勢互補。

丘應樺在開幕式上致辭時表示，今年四月「浙港合作會議」機制正式成立，並舉行浙港高層會晤暨浙港合作會議第一次會議，而投資香港推介大會——浙江（寧波）專場暨甬港經濟合作論壇亦緊接於寧波舉行。他非常高興能再次到訪寧波，進一步推動浙港、甬港經貿合作交流。

他指出，浙江是國家的經濟大省，地區生產總值名列前茅。在推動產業升級轉型、發展新質生產力方面，尤其創新科技和人工智能更是迅速發展。另一方面，香港科研實力亦很強，國際化程度高，國際交流合作網絡廣泛，有潛力成為全球重要的教育、科技和人才中心。

丘應樺表示，在「浙港合作會議」機制的基礎上，浙港兩地將聯手推動包括會計審計、法律及爭議解決服務、管理諮詢、知識產權、工業設計、規劃設計、建築及相關工程等專業服務領域的合作。

他續指，在金融領域，香港擁有優質高效、國際化的金融機構和金融服務，以及既深且廣的資本市場，是理想的籌融資平台。香港亦是全球第五大的商品貿易經濟體系，排在內地、美國、歐洲聯盟和日本之後。

丘應樺提到，儘管全球貿易格局和地緣政治不斷變化，帶來不明朗因素，香港實質本地生產總值在今年第一季按年增加3.1%。今年上半年，香港共完成了42宗首次公開招股，集資額超過1,070億港元，比二○二四年全年多兩成。截至今年六月，申請在港上市的企業當中，浙江企業有19家，佔申請上市企業總數約一成，充分反映香港穩健的金融市場已成為內地企業首選的上市平台。

丘應樺相信，浙港兩地在堅實的經貿合作基礎上，可共同提升現代專業服務合作，吸引全世界的投資者以香港作為跳板，開拓規模和潛力巨大的浙江市場，浙江企業則可透過香港的專業服務走向世界市場。

其他在開幕式致辭的包括全國政協副主席梁振英、中央統戰部副部長馬利懷、浙江省政協主席廉毅敏和寧波市市長湯飛帆。運輸及物流局副局長廖振新和創新科技及工業局副局長張曼莉亦有出席開幕式，並參與兩場專場活動，推動兩地在港口及航運服務、創新應用、科技服務等領域的協同發展。

SCED attends 2nd Zhejiang-Hong Kong Modern Professional Services Cooperation Conference in Ningbo (with photo),2025-07-26 15:30,2025-07-26 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600250.htm,"The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, attended the 2nd Zhejiang-Hong Kong Modern Professional Services Cooperation Conference in Ningbo, Zhejiang, today (July 26) to foster co-operation between the two places in the field of professional services to achieve complementarity.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Mr Yau said that right after the establishment of the Hong Kong/Zhejiang Co-operation Conference Mechanism and the convening of the High-Level Meeting cum the First Plenary Session of the Hong Kong/Zhejiang Co-operation Conference in April this year, the Hong Kong Investment Promotion Conference - Zhejiang (Ningbo) Forum cum Ningbo-Hong Kong Economic Co-operation Forum was held in Ningbo. He said he was very pleased to visit Ningbo again to further promote Zhejiang-Hong Kong and Ningbo-Hong Kong economic and trade co-operation.

Mr Yau said that Zhejiang is an economic powerhouse of the country with its GDP ranking among the top and has been a leading force in advancing the upgrading and transformation of industries and the development of new quality productive forces, especially in the areas of innovation and technology and artificial intelligence. On the other hand, Hong Kong, with its robust research capabilities, high level of internationalisation and extensive networks for international exchange and co-operation, presents vast potential in becoming a globally significant hub for education, technology and talent.

Mr Yau said that building on the foundation of the Hong Kong/Zhejiang Co-operation Conference Mechanism, the two places will work together to promote collaboration in the field of professional services such as accounting and auditing, legal and dispute resolution, management consulting, intellectual property, industrial design, planning and design, architectural and related engineering services.

He added that in the areas of finance, Hong Kong boasts quality, efficient and internationalised financial institutions and financial services, as well as a deep and broad capital market, making it an ideal fundraising platform. Hong Kong is also the world's fifth-largest merchandise trading entity, after the Mainland, the United States, the European Union and Japan.

Mr Yau noted that despite uncertainties brought about by the ever-changing global trade landscape and geopolitics, Hong Kong's real GDP recorded a year-on-year increase of 3.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. In the first half of this year, Hong Kong has completed 42 initial public offerings, raising over HK$107 billion, 20 per cent more than the full-year total for 2024. As at June this year, among the enterprises applying for listing in Hong Kong, 19 of them were from Zhejiang, accounting for about 10 per cent of the total number of applicants. This fully reflected that Hong Kong's robust financial market has become the prime listing platform for Mainland enterprises.

Mr Yau said he believes that with a solid foundation of economic and trade co-operation, Zhejiang and Hong Kong can jointly strengthen collaboration in modern professional services, attracting global investors to use Hong Kong as a springboard to tap into the immense potential of the enormous Zhejiang market, while enabling Zhejiang enterprises to go global by making use of Hong Kong's professional services.

Also speaking at the opening ceremony were Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Mr C Y Leung; Deputy-Head of the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee Mr Ma Lihuai; the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mr Lian Yimin; and the Mayor of the Ningbo Municipal People's Government, Mr Tang Feifan. The Under Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Mr Liu Chun-san, and the Under Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Ms Lillian Cheong, also attended the opening ceremony. In addition, Mr Liu and Ms Cheong attended two thematic sessions to promote the synergistic development of the two places in areas such as port and maritime services, innovative applications and technological services.

Mr Yau will return to Hong Kong this evening."

HKSAR Government disapproves of and opposes untrue and biased remarks by UK,2025-07-26 13:48,2025-07-26 14:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/26/P2025072600445.htm,"âThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (July 26) strongly disappoved of and opposed untrue and biased remarks by the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom (UK) Mr David Lammy and the Home Secretary of the UK Ms Yvette Cooper on HKSAR's lawful act to pursue wanted persons endangering national security absconding from Hong Kong.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""Endangering national security is a very serious offence. No country will watch with folded arms on acts and activities that endanger national security. The 'Hong Kong Parliament' aims to subvert state power; its objectives include promoting 'self-determination', promulgating the so-called 'Hong Kong Constitution', and overthrowing or undermining the basic system of the People's Republic of China established by the Constitution of the People's Republic of China or overthrowing the body of the central power of People’s Republic of China or the body of power of the HKSAR with unlawful means, thereby suspected of having committed the offence of 'Subversion' contrary to Article 22 of the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL). Thus, Police applied to the court for arrest warrants in accordance with the law and put the persons on wanted list.""

""Extraterritorial effect for the offences under the HKNSL and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Hong Kong Police are duty bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security overseas. Those absconders hiding in the UK and other Western countries are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security. More so, they continue to collude with external forces to cover for their evil deeds. It is necessary for the Police to take all lawful measures to strongly combat the acts of abscondment, and such actions are fully justified, necessary and legitimate.

In accordance with international law and international practice based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. With at least 14 pieces of laws in the UK safeguarding national security, the UK has displayed hypocrisy and exposed its double standards by pointing fingers at the HKSAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, while entirely disregarding the constitutional duty and practical needs of the HKSAR to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the relevant national security legislation on economic development and protection of human rights.

The spokesman said, ""Any individuals who endanger national security should not believe that being outside Hong Kong will allow them to evade criminal responsibility and remain beyond the reach of justice. The HKSAR Government will exhaust all means to pursue and combat criminals absconding from Hong Kong and endangering national security, ensuring that violations of the law will be pursued regardless of the distance. The HKSAR Government urged those wanted persons to return to Hong Kong and surrender so as to rectify their mistakes.""

""Regarding the surrender of fugitive offenders, in accordance with the instruction of the Central People's Government (CPG), the HKSAR Government has suspended the agreement between the HKSAR Government and the Government of the UK concerning surrender of fugitive offenders in July 2020. The relevant position remains unchanged. All along, with the authorisation and assistance of the CPG, the HKSAR Government has conducted law enforcement co-operation and mutual legal assistance with other jurisdictions in accordance with the law based on the principle of mutual assistance and reciprocity. The HKSAR Government will, as always, handle relevant matters appropriately.""

The spokesman emphasised, ""The HKSAR Government will continue to resolutely discharge the duty of safeguarding national security, whilst upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly demands the UK Government to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong matters which are purely China's internal affairs."""
