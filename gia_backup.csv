僱主僱員應預先訂立熱帶氣旋及暴雨下的工作安排,2025-10-04 12:20,2025-10-04 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/04/P2025100400354.htm,"由於三號熱帶氣旋警告信號現已生效，勞工處今日（十月四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告及極端情況下及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以確保僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主在擬訂及執行在熱帶氣旋及暴雨警告下及其後的工作安排和應變措施時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮他們的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。

當天文台在工作時間內、預計八號熱帶氣旋警告信號生效前的兩小時內發出預警，僱主應按協定的工作安排讓僱員分批離開工作地點、下班或遙距工作。為確保僱員安全和趕及在公共交通服務停止前回家，一些行動不便的僱員（例如懷孕或殘疾僱員）、須依靠容易受惡劣天氣影響的交通服務（例如渡輪服務）返回居所的僱員，以及於偏遠地點工作或居住的僱員（例如離島），應獲准優先離開。僱主亦應安排其他僱員按返家路程的距離或所需時間分批離開工作地點或下班。

如果黃色、紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外及空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣或極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號、黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。

另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible and repeat it at regular intervals:

  Here is an item of interest to swimmers.

  The Leisure and Cultural Services Department announced today (October 4) that, as lifeguards are unable to go to Trio Beach and Hap Mun Bay Beach in Sai Kung District by ferries due to rough sea conditions, lifesaving services at these beaches have been suspended. Beachgoers are advised not to swim at these beaches."
Employers and employees should make prior work arrangements in times of tropical cyclones and rainstorms,2025-10-04 12:20,2025-10-04 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/04/P2025100400357.htm,"  As the Strong Wind Signal No. 3 (T3) is now in force, the Labour Department (LD) today (October 4) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of establishments, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements and contingency measures for periods during and after tropical cyclone warnings and rainstorm warnings, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees, as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or when the extreme conditions come to an end, and when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather and extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when a tropical cyclone warning, rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.
 
  When a Pre-No. 8 Special Announcement is issued during working hours, within two hours before the Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is expected to take effect, employers should release employees from workplaces or from work in stages or arrange for them to work remotely according to the agreed work arrangements. To ensure the safety of employees and to enable them to arrive home before suspension of public transport services, employees who have mobility problems (for example, pregnant employees or those with a disability), employees who rely on transport services which are prone to being affected by adverse weather conditions (for example, ferry services) to get home, and those who work in or are living in remote areas (for example, outlying islands) should be given priority to leave. Other employees should be released from workplaces or from work in stages according to their travelling distance or the time required for returning home.
  
  If an Amber, Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.
   
  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance on the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 (T8) or higher, Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.
  
  The spokesman also reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.

  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when there is a T8 signal or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

  The LD has published the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"", which provides the major principles, reference guidelines and information on relevant legislation on making work arrangements for the reference of employers and employees. The booklet can be obtained from branch offices of the Labour Relations Division or downloaded from the department's webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf)."
General out-patient clinic service arrangements on day following Mid-Autumn Festival holiday,2025-10-04 11:00,2025-10-04 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/04/P2025100300644.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The Hospital Authority (HA) spokesperson today (October 4) announced that a total of 15 general out-patient clinics (GOPCs) will provide public holiday GOPC services on the day following the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday (October 7) (see table below). Members of the public can make appointments through the telephone appointment system or the ""Book GOPC"" function on the ""HA Go"" mobile application.

As influenza activity remains at a high level, the HA spokesperson appeals to members of the public to receive vaccinations early. Public hospitals and out-patient clinics of the HA have started providing seasonal influenza vaccinations to eligible persons to dovetail with the Government Vaccination Programme 2025/26. Eligible patients may receive vaccinations at their scheduled follow-up appointments at clinics. Patients with distant follow-up appointment dates may visit or contact the respective clinics for necessary arrangements.

Meanwhile, the HA spokesperson reminds the public to stay vigilant about personal and environmental hygiene during the holidays to avoid spreading diseases. Members of the public who develop respiratory symptoms should wear masks and seek medical advice promptly. Non-emergency patients should avoid using accident and emergency (A&E) services and instead seek treatment at GOPCs, private doctors or 24-hour out-patient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es. Members of the public can visit the Health Bureau's Primary Care Directory www.pcdirectory.gov.hk to choose a family doctor and view related clinic service information.

鑑於近期流感活躍程度維持在高水平，醫管局發言人呼籲市民盡早接種季節性流感疫苗。醫管局配合二○二五／二六年度政府防疫注射計劃，已開始在公立醫院及門診診所為合資格人士接種季節性流感疫苗。合資格病人可按原定覆診日期到診所接種疫苗，如果病人在短期內毋須覆診，亦可以親臨或致電所屬診所安排接種疫苗。

同時，醫管局發言人提醒市民，在假日期間應注意個人及環境衞生，避免傳播疾病。市民如出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上口罩及盡快求醫。非緊急的病人應避免使用急症室，盡量向普通科門診、私家醫生及私家醫院24小時門診求診，以減輕公立醫院急症室的壓力。市民可瀏覽醫務衞生局《基層醫療指南》www.pcdirectory.gov.hk，選擇適合自己的家庭醫生及查閱其應診資料。

在高溫環境下，大量出汗及散熱困難，均會導致身體不勝負荷，市民應採取以下預防措施：


適時補充水分，以防脫水；
穿着淺色、寬鬆及通爽的衣物，減少吸熱，方便排汗及散熱；
保持室內空氣流通，例如打開窗戶；
避免進行劇烈運動或作長程的登山或遠足等活動；
戶外活動最好安排在早上或下午較後時間進行，同時應帶備充足水分；及
避免飲用含咖啡因的飲品，例如咖啡和茶，以及酒精類飲品，以免增加水分經泌尿系統流失的速度。


除上述要點，重點人群包括嬰兒及小童、長者、孕婦、長期病如心臟病或高血壓患者、戶外／體力勞動者和過胖人士均較易中暑，應特別注意：


應盡量避免攜帶嬰幼兒於高溫時段外出；如必須外出時，成人需確保嬰幼兒處於溫度適中，通風或有冷氣的地方，不應獨留嬰幼兒在汽車等密閉空間內；
長者、孕婦、長期病患者和過胖人士應密切關注身體狀況，如血壓、心率等指標出現異常或病情出現波動，應盡快尋求協助。盡量避免高溫時段外出，在室內時要注意通風或開風扇／冷氣保持適宜的溫度。高溫亦有機會導致慢性疾病（如心血管和呼吸道疾病）患者的病情惡化，故此應確保常用藥物儲備充足及與家人、鄰里和社區保持聯繫。如感到不適，應立即尋求協助。
戶外工作及／或體力勞動者盡量安排在較涼快的時間工作。若必須在炎熱環境下工作，盡可能在工作地點加設遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備。開始工作後，循序漸進調整工作步伐，並適時在蔭涼處休息，恢復體力。


中心發言人說：「中暑是高溫天氣下最常見的健康風險之一。在過去五年，本港每年有超過200宗因中暑入院的個案，當中死亡的個案每年約有二至五宗，集中於五月至九月的夏季時間。重點人群較易中暑，病徵包括頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等，嚴重者會出現全身痙攣或昏迷等現象，若不及時替患者降溫及急救，便會有生命危險。」

​市民亦應留意由香港天文台（天文台）公布的最新天氣，以及實時和預測的紫外線指數。當紫外線指數偏高（6或以上）時：


減少陽光直接照射皮膚或眼睛；
在進行戶外活動時，應塗抹防曬系數30或以上的廣譜及防水的防曬產品。如需長時間在戶外逗留，或在游泳、流汗或以毛巾抺身後，應每兩小時再次塗上防曬產品；
使用含避蚊胺的昆蟲驅避劑預防蚊傳疾病時，應先塗上防曬霜，然後再塗上昆蟲驅避劑；
選擇有遮蔭的地方；
戴上能阻隔紫外線的太陽眼鏡；
穿着長袖的寬鬆衣物；及
戴闊邊帽或撐傘。


若出現頭暈、頭痛、噁心、氣促、神志不清等病徵，應立刻休息和求助，並盡快求醫。

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

If engaged in outdoor work or activities, wear a wide-brimmed hat and light-coloured, loose-fitting clothes. Stay in shaded areas as much as possible.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-04 06:45,2025-10-04 07:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/04/P2025100400214.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 4) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

The spokesperson said, ""The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the General Administration of Customs of China have all along maintained communication on the arrangements for the import of hairy crabs to Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Central Government for assistance in streamlining the import arrangements.""

Streamlining procedures and enhancing Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles to make better use of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge's carrying capacity,2025-10-03 19:55,2025-10-03 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300802.htm," The Transport Department (TD) today (October 3) said that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government have been continuously enhancing the implementation arrangements of the Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles (NBT) scheme based on the principles of streamlining procedures and improving the experience. This aims to facilitate efficient cross-boundary travel and make better use of the carrying capacity of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) further, thereby promoting the integrated development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

 A spokesman for the TD said that the Government published in the Gazette today that, starting from October 13, applicants approved to participate in NBT need not apply for Closed Road Permits (CRPs) and pay permit fees. Upon receipt of the ""electronic approval letters"" issued by the TD, they can proceed to book their trips online or travel directly on days with no bookings required. This new arrangement will provide more convenience and attract more people to apply for NBT, enhancing their travel experience.

 Since its implementation in July 2023, NBT has become popular among Hong Kong citizens. Both passenger and vehicle flows between Guangdong and Hong Kong via the HZMB have been on the rise, and over 100 000 Hong Kong private cars have participated in NBT to date. The governments of the two places have been enhancing NBT from applications, vehicle inspection and booking arrangements to provide additional convenience for Hong Kong residents to drive to Guangdong Province for work, business, sight-seeing and visiting families. Such measures include:

(1) Increasing the number of applications accepted: The number of applications for NBT accepted on each working day has been gradually increased from 200 at the beginning to 500 from January 2025. Unused quotas from applications not submitted within the assigned period are allocated to the next round, making full use of resources;

(2) Adjustments to booking arrangements: Since October 2023, the travel booking time slots have been adjusted from six sessions to four sessions to allow greater flexibility for travel; and since February 2024, the deadlines for making and cancelling travel booking were adjusted from two days and three days before the travelling date, respectively, to 12 noon on the day before travelling;

(3) Enhancing vehicle inspection arrangements: Following the establishment of a dedicated NBT vehicle inspection centre in Hong Kong, applicants need not undergo vehicle inspection on the Mainland. From March 2024, vehicle inspection was exempted if the applicant re-submits NBT applications within two years upon passing the vehicle inspection within the validity of the Mainland Electronic Vehicle Licence and with the applicant and vehicle remaining unchanged;

(4) Renewal convenience: From May 2024, if the applicant, vehicle (including vehicle registration mark, colour and chassis/vehicle identification number) and the designated drivers remain unchanged, computer balloting was not required and applicants can submit their renewal applications online within the assigned period. Besides, if the renewal applicants do not conform to the above renewal qualifications, they should re-register for the ballot and submit their applications afresh within the designated period. In addition, the ballot registration period has been relaxed from 30 to 60 days prior to the expiry of their CRPs for better convenience;

(5) Extending application period: Since April 2025, the designated application period for new and renewal applicants has been extended from three and six calendar days, respectively, to 13 days for both, providing sufficient time for applicants to prepare the necessary documents;

(6) Waiving booking prior to travel: From September 1, 2025, bookings are not required for vehicles travelling via the HZMB under NBT on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, except specified dates. Among the Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the first three weeks of September, the number of vehicle trips to Guangdong Province under NBT has significantly increased compared to that in August before the implementation of the new arrangement, providing convenience for more flexible travel; and

(7) No need to apply for CRP: From October 13, 2025, approved applicants under NBT are not required to make an application for CRP and pay permit fees. They may make travel booking immediately after receiving the ""electronic approval letter"" issued by the TD with a better travelling experience.

 The governments of the two places will continue to review the effectiveness of enhancement measures. Applicants may refer to NBT's thematic website (www.hzmbqfs.gov.hk) for details."
精簡程序優化「港車北上」　善用港珠澳大橋承載力,2025-10-03 19:55,2025-10-03 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300799.htm,"運輸署今日（十月三日）表示，特區政府與廣東省政府一直以精簡程序和提升體驗為原則，持續優化「港車北上」的實施安排，推動便捷的跨境通行，進一步善用港珠澳大橋的承載力，促進粵港澳大灣區融合發展。

運輸署發言人表示，政府今日刊憲公布，由十月十三日起，獲批准參與「港車北上」的申請人，無需再申請封閉道路通行許可證（許可證）及繳付許可證費用，在接獲運輸署發出的「電子批准信」後即可在網上預約出行，或在無須預約的日子直接出行。這項新安排將更便利和吸引更多人申請參與「港車北上」，同時提升出行體驗。

「港車北上」自二○二三年七月推行至今，廣受香港市民歡迎，使用大橋來往粵港兩地的人流車流持續上升，迄今有超過10萬輛香港私家車曾參與計劃。粵港兩地政府一直從申請、驗車、預約續期等方面優化計劃，進一步便利香港居民以自駕方式前往廣東省工作、經商、旅遊和探親等。措施包括：

（一）增加接受申請數目：「港車北上」已由最初每個工作天接受200宗申請，逐步增至今年一月起每天500宗；未按申請時間遞交申請的名額會撥入下一輪，充分利用資源；

（二）調整預約安排：由二○二三年十月起，預約出行時段由六個調整至四個，提升出行彈性；並由二○二四年二月起，將預約出行及取消預約的時限，分別由出行日子前的兩個及三個曆日前劃一至出行日子前一天的中午十二時；

（三）優化驗車安排：香港專設「港車北上」車輛查驗中心，申請人無需往內地驗車。由二○二四年三月起，申請人在驗車合格後兩年內再次申請，如內地電子臨時入境機動車牌證仍然有效，而申請人和車輛維持不變，則可獲豁免再次驗車；

（四）便利續期：由二○二四年五月起，如申請人、車（包括車輛登記號碼、車身顔色及底盤／車輛識別號碼等）及指定司機維持不變，可在指定時間於網上申請續期，而無須重新參與電腦抽籤。此外，如續期申請人不符合上述的續期申請資格，須重新參與電腦抽籤，並於獲分配的指定時段內遞交新申請。而登記抽籤的時限亦已由許可證有效期屆滿前30日放寬至60日前，更為便利；

（五）延長申請時段：由今年四月起，新和續期申請人的指定申請時段由分別三和六個曆日，劃一延長至13日，讓申請人有更充足時間準備所需文件；

（六）豁免預約出行：由今年九月一日起，參與計劃的車輛逢星期二及三（指定日子除外）無須預約便可經大橋出行。在九月首三個星期的星期二及三，計劃下出行前往廣東省的車輛架次較八月實施新安排前顯著增加約五成，方便市民更有彈性地出行；及

（七）無須申請許可證：由今年十月十三日起，獲批准參與「港車北上」的申請人，不用再申請許可證及繳付許可證費用，並可在接獲運輸署發出的「電子批准信」後，隨即在網上預約出行，提升出行體驗。

粵港兩地政府會繼續檢視優化措施的成效。申請人可參閱「港車北上」專題網頁（www.hzmbqfs.gov.hk）了解詳情。"

The same arrangement applies to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) Macao Port Park-and-Ride Scheme and the Shenzhen Bay Ad Hoc Quotas for Cross Boundary Private Cars, with effect from October 20. Such measures will further facilitate cross-boundary travel and enhance efficiency, and over 100 000 eligible vehicles are expected to benefit.

 The application eligibility and other conditions of the above-mentioned schemes remain unchanged. Anyone who wishes to participate in the schemes is still required to submit applications to the TD in accordance with the respective schemes' requirements. However, upon the TD's approval, vehicles will not be subject to the designated closed road restrictions and will not need to apply for CRPs for passing through the closed roads connecting the control points. Appropriate traffic signs will be set up at relevant locations to indicate that vehicles approved under the designated schemes are exempted from closed road restrictions. Vehicles may be driven on the following closed roads according to the respective scheme arrangements:

運輸及物流局局長出席北環線項目啓動禮致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-03 19:00,2025-10-03 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300792.htm,"以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（十月三日）出席北環線項目啓動禮的致辭全文：

歐陽伯權主席（香港鐵路有限公司（港鐵公司）主席）、金澤培博士（港鐵公司行政總裁）、王卉部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室新界工作部副部長）、張欣宇議員、劉國勳議員、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位傳媒朋友：

今天是一個非常好的日子。在這個高溫的下午，體現了我們的熱情，以及對這個項目的熱烈期盼。希望透過我剛才提到的三個「熱」——熱的溫度、我們的熱情，以及熱烈的期盼，為這個項目注入熱能，為我們的工程團隊加油，令我們的項目如歐陽伯權主席所說，提速提效。

說到北環線，就不能不提北部都會區（北都）。北部都會區是今年行政長官在《施政報告》裏着墨很多、亦非常強調的發展區域。北都不論是面積還是將來預計的人口，均佔香港三分之一，對推動整體社會和經濟發展是一個非常重要的引擎。

近年，特區政府、港鐵公司和其他工程承建商都是本着「基建先行、創造容量」的方向，大力推動鐵路和道路全方位發展，尤其是推動北部都會區的發展。除了今天我們見證這個具標誌性的啓動禮外，正如剛才歐陽主席所說，我們有第100個港鐵車站——古洞站，以及洪水橋站，都是位於北部都會區內重要、關鍵的地方，據我了解，進度都是非常好，較早前亦已率先動工。古洞站可爭取在二○二七年落成，而洪水橋站則會在二○三○年落成。這兩個站將連接日後北環線的主線和支線，是作為北部都會區驅動發展的重要引擎。

讓我介紹一下北環線的重要性。它除了帶動北部都會區的發展，大家亦可以對照乘搭地鐵時看到的路線圖，北環線將連接東鐵線和屯馬線，和北部地區與市區，以及新界其他部分構建成一個環迴的走線，是一個全面覆蓋的網絡。

第二點，北環線除了主線還有支線。支線會跨境連接新皇崗口岸，日後將實施「一地兩檢」，帶動跨境人流。

第三點可以談談北環線將為市民出行帶來的便捷性。通車後，由東面的古洞站前往西面的錦上路站，出行時間將由目前的60分鐘大幅縮短至12分鐘，這是一個非常明顯的改善。而從香港的新田站到新皇崗口岸亦只需11分鐘。鐵路的建造不單為香港整個布局作全面規劃，亦在出行便捷方面帶來了非常明顯的好處。

今天出席這個啓動禮我深感興奮。過去劉國勳議員和張欣宇議員在立法會多個場合就鐵路項目不斷向我獻計，希望我們又能夠全面推動，又可以先將個別成熟項目先推展，我們這次真的做到了。正如今日我們身處這個啓動禮，傳統在工程上叫ground breaking，我們真的做到break the ground。北環線工程上有三個突破，包括：

第一， 我們將主線和支線全面一起兼容地推動，希望帶來協同效應；

第二，我們會分階段推展，哪一部分成熟就推進該部分，所以今天很高興港鐵完成了動土和啓動儀式。其實，我們已與港鐵簽署了第一階段的協議，希望能盡快爭取完成第二階段的協議，這樣便能真正爭分奪秒，讓工程可以盡快上馬；

第三，就是近日我們多次提及，希望為香港的鐵路構建一個新的鐵路標準，將內地和海外最好的精華、最好的標準都包含到香港未來將會制訂的新鐵路標準。我們會結合內地建造的優勢，包括團隊、器械、機器和設備，率先在北環線主線第一期適時採用，以體現我們在政策和技術兩方面的創新，達到提速提效和降低成本。

剛才主席也提到項目時間表，藉着我所說的三個突破，我們爭取將支線的時間表提前整整兩年，與主線同步落成。我們的目標是爭取在二○三○年（應為二○三四年）或之前，兩部分一起同步落成。我們會熱切期盼。

我想藉此機會特別感謝港鐵公司和其團隊，無論是以往在項目興建、設計、建造和營運，以至最近處理颱風後的恢復工作，正正體現到團隊是精益求精。港鐵公司同事的DNA體現了我們所說的——「沒有最好，只有更好」，有自我求變、自我期許的精神。就落實和建造北環線項目，容許我提出三個期許：

首先是安全為本，這是非常重要的。在建造和日後營運的時候，以高舉及維持香港建造安全為我們的首要考慮；

第二是驅動創新發展，帶來多一點新技術，引入多一點新企業，令香港在建造方面多元化，有突破性的發展；

第三是做到以民為本。剛才我坐車由市區來到這個地方，看到這個項目是深入很偏遠的地方，環境相當優美。雖然會比較近民居，但這方面我不擔心，因為港鐵在過去三十多年，都有在不同的民居旁邊建造。港鐵請了一班年青大使，有大學、中學的朋友，令我很感動的是他們在過去一兩年不停地探訪北區沿線一些中學和小學，就北環線向他們進行宣傳和教育，營造地區的協作氣氛。

我希望很快在這裏看到新的基建，連接北部都會區，以至連接香港不同的地方，為我們香港的經濟和社會發展添加動能，讓香港發光發熱。多謝大家。"

九月份第八批涵蓋九個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，除了沙田區馬鞍山的分區誘蚊器指數，其餘都在10%以下。

針對指數高於10%的沙田區馬鞍山，按因應基孔肯雅熱情況而實施的安排（即將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域），食環署正聯同有關部門及持份者找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。馬鞍山誘蚊器的數據顯示蚊患較多的地方包括公園、學校、公共屋邨和私人屋苑，各相關部門及持份者正積極跟進控蚊工作。食環署亦會舉辦宣傳展覽、派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年九月共八批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年八月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，在這64個監察區中，54個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有九區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"
FEHD releases eighth batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in September (with photos),2025-10-03 18:55,2025-10-03 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300687.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (October 3) released the eighth batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in September, covering nine survey areas, as follows:

Among the eighth batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering nine survey areas in September, all were below 10 per cent, except Ma On Shan in Sha Tin District.

For Ma On Shan in Sha Tin District, which recorded an index over 10 per cent, in accordance with the mechanism implemented by the FEHD in response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation (i.e. strengthening mosquito control work in areas with a gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, instead of 20 per cent or above under the original mechanism), the FEHD is collaborating with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with high mosquito infestations and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. In particular, the gravidtrap data for Ma On Shan showed that areas with more mosquito problems included parks, schools and public and private housing estates. The relevant departments and stakeholders are actively following up on the mosquito control work. The FEHD will also organise exhibitions, distribute leaflets and posters, and notify the residential estates that have subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together on mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen the monitoring of the gravidtrap index in this area to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

The FEHD has so far released eight batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in September 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 54 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. August 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Nine other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
投資推廣署訪問北美　開拓綠色金融與綠色科技合作新機遇（附圖）,2025-10-03 18:30,2025-10-03 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300394.htm,"投資推廣署（投資署）九月十六至二十七日在北美的訪問行程圓滿結束。此行程為投資署自二○二二年成立可持續發展團隊後，首次以綠色科技、綠色金融及可持續發展等為重點出訪北美，旨在協助北美領先企業開拓香港、中國內地及亞洲市場，積極推廣可持續發展領域的合作。

投資署金融服務及科技、可持續發展環球總裁梁瀚璟，以及投資署高級副總裁（可持續發展）（科技、創新和創業）杜珮煒，聯同港深創新及科技園（港深創科園），到訪多倫多、紐約和三藩市推廣香港優勢及機遇，建立新的合作及雙向商機。

此行其中一項焦點，是九月二十三日（紐約時間）於美國規模最大的氣候與可持續發展盛事──二○二五年紐約氣候周舉行的Scale for ClimateTech Innovation Showcase 2025（S4C） 活動。該活動由SecondMuse主辦，並獲紐約州能源研究與發展局支持。活動期間，梁瀚璟向超過三百名參加者分享香港作為初創企業拓展綠色科技業務的理想跳板的優勢。他指：「我們在紐約氣候周的交流充分展現香港致力成為全球綠色金融與綠色科技中心，並為全球可持續發展作出貢獻的決心。北美綠色科技公司可善用香港世界級的資本市場、家族辦公室及創投網絡進行融資，並拓展至香港、中國內地和亞洲市場。香港正是協助創新者走向全球的理想平台。」

在S4C活動中，18家入圍決賽的氣候科技公司展示其在潔淨能源、碳捕集、智能感知技術等領域的創新方案。梁瀚璟出席有關簡報會，並就香港如何協助吸引新客戶與資本等議題交換意見。

SecondMuse行政總裁及聯合創辦人Todd Khozein表示：「我們歡迎投資署作為S4C的合作夥伴，促進聯繫具影響力的氣候解決方案。香港在綠色金融領域發展迅速──不僅匯聚龐大資金，更透過建設基礎設施支持可持續創新。香港作為氣候金融樞紐的地位日益提升，為與企業協作創造重大機遇，共同推動全球持續創新。」

為探索長遠夥伴關係，投資署亦與加拿大專注硬體科技的孵化器與實驗室VentureLAB、專注潔淨科技與生命科學的創新中心MaRS Discovery District、協助全球初創進入美國市場的SOSA New York，以及矽谷的全球創新平台及創投公司Plug and Play等機構進行深入交流。

VentureLAB行政總裁周憲本表示：「作為加拿大領先的創新樞紐，我們熱切期待與投資署合作，協助加拿大企業對接香港充滿活力的生態圈。透過善用香港連接大灣區的優勢、頂尖的研發基礎設施及蓬勃的投資機遇，加拿大綠色科技公司可加速業務增長，在亞洲可持續市場發揮重要影響力。」

除了與加速器企業交流，團隊亦透過在多倫多和紐約舉辦的兩場商業午宴，與商界及投資界領袖探討綠色科技、綠色金融及金融科技的合作機會。午宴由香港經濟貿易辦事處協辦。其間，投資署介紹香港在可持續發展及金融領域的最新經濟發展，並向北美商界領袖及潛在投資者展示香港在連接北美創新與亞洲可持續發展方案及金融機遇需求的策略角色。

為促進有意進軍香港和中國內地市場的全球投資者交流，團隊亦與Artesian、Cathay Innovation、Eminence Ventures、E.ON Group Innovation、Olive Tech Ventures等機構進行深入討論。

除吸引外來投資，投資署亦協助已在港設立業務的企業出海。團隊到訪全球最大太陽能科技及可再生能源企業之一，業務遍布23個國家，並正擴展香港業務的阿特斯陽光電力集團。訪問期間，團隊與阿特斯陽光電力集團高層及其子公司EternalPlanet Energy和e-STORAGE代表會面。

阿特斯陽光電力集團總裁庄岩表示：「投資署到訪我們位於北美的全球總部，為加強香港與北美在可持續發展及綠色科技方面的聯繫奠定堅實基礎。隨着全球地緣政治挑戰加劇，香港的策略地位將更為重要。因此，我們專注住宅儲能的子公司EternalPlanet Energy計劃在香港設立分部，作為其國際業務樞紐，並利用大灣區拓展至全球其他市場。」

《行政長官2025年施政報告》中明確提出二○五○年前實現碳中和的目標，重點聚焦新能源產業與綠色技術發展。為此香港致力推行《香港氣候行動藍圖2050》、《香港氫能發展策略》，並大力投資河套深港科技創新合作區。這些措施旨在發展香港成為綠色科技示範基地、加速創新、創造優質職位，並構建完善的產業價值鏈。

港深創科園可持續發展總監鄭銘澤表示：「參與這次北美訪問，進一步鞏固港深創科園在跨境綠色科技合作中的重要角色。港深創科園為北美企業提供接軌亞洲創新走廊的絕佳機遇，我期望與投資署的緊密合作能進一步推動新能源及新材料領域的發展。」

香港致力成為全球綠色金融及科技樞紐，擁有世界級研發設施和科研機構，持續推動前沿創新。香港在首次公開招股集資方面成績斐然，作為全球第三大金融中心，擁有國際機構及家族辦公室投資者組成的穩健資本市場，以及完善的綠色金融生態系統。

此次北美訪問彰顯香港促進國際合作、推動全球邁向可持續未來的堅定承諾。通過吸引更多加拿大和美國的綠色科技企業與投資者，香港將進一步鞏固其作為可持續創新與投資首選樞紐的地位。

InvestHK opens new opportunities and partnerships in green finance and green tech in North America (with photos),2025-10-03 18:30,2025-10-03 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300387.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) concluded a groundbreaking trip to North America from September 16 to 27. Since InvestHK set up a dedicated sustainability team in 2022, this was the first time that InvestHK visited North America with a primary focus in green tech, green finance, and sustainability more broadly. The goal is to help leading companies from North America to expand to Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland, and Asia, a region with an unwavering commitment to embrace and foster sustainable development.

  The Global Head of Financial Services, Fintech & Sustainability at InvestHK, Mr King Leung, and the Senior Vice President (Sustainability) for Technology, Innovation and Entrepreneurship at InvestHK, Ms Olivia To, in partnership with the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park (HSITP), visited Toronto, New York and San Francisco to promote Hong Kong's strengths and opportunities, build new partnerships and kick-start two-way business engagements.

  One highlight of the trip was the Scale for ClimateTech Innovation Showcase 2025 (S4C) event held on September 23 (New York time) during Climate Week NYC 2025, the largest climate and sustainability event in the United States (US). Organised by SecondMuse and supported by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, Mr Leung of InvestHK spoke at a panel discussion with over 300 industry leaders, sharing insights on Hong Kong's advantages as a springboard for scaling green-tech start-ups and scale-ups. He said, ""Our engagements at Climate Week NYC highlighted Hong Kong's commitment to be a leading green finance and green tech centre and the city's contribution to global sustainable development. North American companies can tap into our world-class capital markets and vast family office and venture investor networks to explore fundraising and expand in Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland, and Asia. Hong Kong is perfectly positioned to help innovators scale globally.""

  At the S4C event, 18 finalists of climate tech companies showcased their transformative solutions in clean energy, carbon capture, sensing technologies, etc. Mr Leung attended their business plan presentations and exchanged views with their executives on how Hong Kong can help them attract new clients and capital.

  The Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of SecondMuse, Mr Todd Khozein, said, ""We were delighted to welcome Invest Hong Kong as a partner for our Scale for ClimateTech Innovation Showcase, and help facilitate connections with high-impact climate solutions that can scale. Hong Kong has demonstrated real momentum in green finance - mobilising significant capital and building infrastructure to support sustainable innovation. Hong Kong's evolving position as a hub for climate finance creates meaningful opportunities for continued collaboration to support entrepreneurs and innovations that can drive global impact.""

  To explore longer-term partnerships, the InvestHK team also held important discussions with VentureLAB, Canada's dedicated incubator and lab for hardtech; MaRS Discovery District, Canada's leading urban innovation hub with a strong focus in clean tech and life science; SOSA New York, a company that facilitates the US market entry and expansion for global start-ups; and Plug and Play, a global innovation platform and early-stage venture capital firm headquartered in Silicon Valley.

  The Chief Executive Officer of VentureLAB, Mr Hugh Chow, stated, ""As a leading innovation hub in Canada, we are eager to collaborate with InvestHK to connect Canadian firms with Hong Kong's dynamic ecosystem. By leveraging Hong Kong's access to the the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), cutting-edge research and development (R&D) infrastructure, and robust investment opportunities, Canadian green tech companies can accelerate their growth and make a significant impact in Asia’s sustainable markets.""

  Besides accelerators, the team further engaged with business and investment leaders to explore collaborative opportunities in green tech, green finance, financial services, and fintech through two business luncheons hosted in Toronto and New York respectively. Co-organised with the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, these roundtables featured InvestHK in presenting the latest economic developments in sustainability and finance in Hong Kong. The discussions provided North American business leaders and potential investors with insights into Hong Kong's strategic role in bridging North American innovation with Asia's growing demand for sustainable solutions and other finance-related opportunities.

  To connect with the global investors interested in Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland markets, extensive discussions were also made with Artesian, Cathay Innovation, Eminence Ventures, E.ON Group Innovation, and Olive Tech Ventures, etc.

  Besides inbound investment promotion, InvestHK also has a strategic mandate in supporting companies with a presence in Hong Kong to ""go global"". InvestHK visited CSI Solar, one of the world's largest solar technology and renewable energy companies with a presence in 23 countries that is expanding its operations in Hong Kong. During the visit, the team met with senior management from CSI Solar, as well as its subsidiaries EternalPlanet Energy and e-STORAGE.

  The President of CSI Solar, Mr Zhuang Yan, said, ""InvestHK's visit to our Global headquarters in North America has forged a robust foundation for strengthening ties between Hong Kong and North American sustainability and green technology. As global geopolitical challenges increase, Hong Kong's strategic position will become even more significant. Thus, our residential storage subsidiary, EternalPlanet Energy, is planning to establish a Hong Kong branch as its international business hub, leveraging the GBA to access global markets.""

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" highlights the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, focusing on the development of the new energy sector and green technologies. The city is implementing the Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050, the Strategy of Hydrogen Development in Hong Kong, and significantly investing in the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone. These efforts aim to develop Hong Kong into a demonstration base for green technology, accelerate innovation, create quality jobs, and foster a robust industry value chain.

  The Director of Sustainability of the HSITP, Mr Victor Cheng, said, ""Participating in this North American trip reinforced the HSITP's role in cross-boundary green tech collaboration. The Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park offers unparalleled opportunities for North American firms to integrate with Asia's innovation corridor, and I am confident that our strong partnership with InvestHK will further advance development, particularly in the space of new energy and new materials.""

  Hong Kong's commitment as a global green finance and green tech hub is driven by its world-class R&D facilities and research institutes, fostering cutting-edge innovation. As the world's third-largest financial centre, the city boasts a proven track record in initial public offering funds raised, supported by a robust capital market with international institutional and savvy family office investors, as well as a robust green finance ecosystem.

  This visit to North America underscores Hong Kong's commitment to fostering international collaboration and contributing to the global transition to a sustainable future. By attracting more Canadian and US companies and investors in green tech, Hong Kong aims to cement its role as a premier destination for sustainable innovation and investment.

Six persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-10-03 18:03,2025-10-03 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300707.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations, including an operation codenamed ""Twilight"" yesterday (October 2). A total of four suspected illegal workers, one suspected employer and one overstayer were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided 17 target locations including renovation sites, restaurants and food stalls, etc. Four suspected illegal workers and a suspected employer were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers were women aged 39 to 51. A woman aged 49 was suspected of employing the illegal workers and was also arrested.

  An investigation into suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, 24-hour Immigration Offences Hotline 2824 1551, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
反非法勞工行動拘六人（附圖）,2025-10-03 18:03,2025-10-03 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300708.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）昨日（十月二日）在全港多區展開反非法勞工行動，包括「曙光行動」。行動中共拘捕四名懷疑非法勞工、一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主及一名逾期逗留人士。

反非法勞工行動中，入境處調查人員搜查了十七個目標地點，包括裝修單位、餐廳及小食店等，共拘捕四名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工均為女性，年齡介乎三十九至五十一歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一名四十九歲女子。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、24小時舉報熱線2824 1551、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"

林司長（律政司司長林定國資深大律師）、張副司長（律政司副司長張國鈞博士）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。我很高興能夠出席今日的頒獎典禮，與大家一同分享得獎者的喜悅。首先，我非常感謝律政司提出這個緊貼潮流的比賽，成功展現利用社交媒體推廣國家安全的巨大潛力。

我在評審過程中，欣賞到各位參賽者絞盡腦汁，以生動的方式帶出共同維護國家安全的重要信息，令我深深感受到在《香港國安法》的守護下，青年對未來是充滿希望的。

《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》共同築起了香港特區維護國家安全的屏障。不過，即使我們已經持續完善維護國安的法律制度，在當前複雜的地緣政治局勢下，國安風險依然存在。例如，我們經常都提醒大家，別有用心的人會以片面敘事、曲解甚至抹黑等手段去攻擊特區以至中央政府，以所謂「軟對抗」的手段製造仇恨，蠱惑人心。針對這些行為，需要大家慎思明辨，小心留意和分辨假新聞、假消息。要做到這一點，我們可以參考今次比賽的經驗，從自身開始，利用社交媒體發放正面、正確的信息，同時向家人、朋友推廣國家安全的意識。

保安局亦會多管齊下，繼續傳揚國家安全的重要性，令大家自覺成為國家安全的參與者和守護者。其中，我們會將「保安熊仔」和「安仔」的故事帶入幼稚園，讓小朋友從小就接觸到國安的信息。另外，我們的《安仔與熊仔》校園話劇亦將於十一月舉行啟動禮和首演，之後就會到小學演出，以話劇形式推廣國家安全的概念。這套話劇亦會在來年正式於劇場公演，將「國安家好」的主旨進一步植根於社區。另外，還有一年一度、由保安局聯同律政司、教育局以及善德基金會合辦的全港學界國家安全常識挑戰賽。今年繼續得到600多間中、小學參與，成績令人鼓舞。在此，我要感謝所有參加學校的鼎力支持。

最後，通過今次的社交媒體帖文創作比賽，我希望大家能夠明白到每個人都可以是國家安全的推動者，亦希望大家繼續發揮創意，將「國安家好」的主旨推廣得更深更遠。多謝大家。"

各位嘉賓、各位老師、各位同學：

大家下午好！歡迎大家出席今日的頒獎禮。首先，我要感謝在座各位師生在繁重的教學及學習下，仍然抽出時間參加由律政司及保安局舉辦的「香港國安法—守護與希望」社交媒體帖文創作比賽。是次比賽反應熱烈，我們在短時間內便收到近600份優秀的參賽作品。每一份作品的構思、製作都非常用心，充分展現了參賽師生的無限創意及對傳遞維護國家安全這個重要信息的熱情。

維護國家主權、安全、發展利益是包括全體香港市民在內的中國公民的共同責任，律政司跟在座各位一樣責無旁貸。在社會中各個層面積極開展國家安全教育，着力提高香港居民的國家安全意識和守法意識，既是《香港國安法》的要求，也體現了香港堅守法治的核心價值。展望將來，律政司會繼續致力推動及普及維護國家安全及法治教育，尤其會深耕社區和學校，務求積極主動、持之以恆在本地和國際社會講好維護國家安全的好故事，推動社會各界自覺維護國家安全。

最後，我再次感謝參與今次比賽的各位同學，並衷心祝賀各位得獎者。我更要特別感謝於《香港國安法》公布實施五周年論壇中參與現場表演的同學及朋友，讓大家的作品跳出了社交媒體，將維護國家安全的重要信息立體呈現。各位都是最了不起的推動維護國安大使，我必須為你們的熱誠和擔當點讚！希望各位繼續努力，多謝大家。"

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得24宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至八月，全球16個國家／地區呈報了約31萬7千宗基孔肯雅熱病例及135宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

​此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-03 17:30,2025-10-03 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300683.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 3), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 24 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of August, approximately 317 000 CF cases and 135 CF-related deaths have been reported in 16 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âThe CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
23名分間單位規管租賃業主因違反相關法例規定而被定罪,2025-10-03 17:23,2025-10-03 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300674.htm,"23名分間單位業主因違反《業主與租客（綜合）條例》（第7章）第IVA部（《條例》）的相關規定，於九月十九日及今日（十月三日）在東區裁判法院承認有關控罪，並被判處罰款介乎800元至25,600元，合計罰款共77,600元。自《條例》生效以來，差餉物業估價署（估價署）持續加強採取執法行動，至今已合共檢控1 229宗個案，而就法庭已處理的886宗個案，均全數成功定罪，共涉及770名分間單位業主，合計總罰款共2,364,110元，另有343宗個案則正等待進行聆訊。

該23名業主的罪行包括（一）沒有在規管租賃的租期開始後的60日內，向估價署署長提交租賃通知書（表格AR2）；及（二）要求租客支付不屬《條例》所准許的種類的款項（包括要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額）。

估價署於早前發現這些業主涉嫌違反《條例》的相關規定。經深入調查及搜集證據後，估價署向這些業主提出檢控。

估價署發言人重申，分間單位業主必須嚴格遵守《條例》下的相關規定，包括禁止業主刻意打擾租戶成員的安寧或舒適生活等，意圖使租客放棄佔用其分間單位；要求租客支付的次期租賃租金超過《條例》所准許的最高租金款額；同時提醒租客在《條例》下所享有的權益，包括四年（即兩年加兩年）的租住權保障。他亦強調估價署會繼續堅決執法，打擊任何違例個案。估價署除了跟進舉報個案，亦一直以多管齊下的方式主動識別、調查及跟進有關業主涉嫌違反《條例》規定的個案。就此，估價署要求規管租賃的業主提供與租賃有關的資料及參考文件，以核實他們是否已遵從《條例》的規定。如業主無合理辯解而拒絕提供相關資料或忽略署方要求，即屬違法，最高可處第三級罰款（10,000元）及監禁三個月。因應實際情況和所蒐集的資料及證據，估價署會對個別個案採取適當行動，包括就涉嫌觸犯《條例》下罪行的個案提出檢控。此外，估價署已展開新一輪宣傳教育工作，加強宣傳《條例》下主要罪行及刑罰，並強調會主動審查業主有否觸犯《條例》下罪行。

為幫助盡早遏止違法行為，市民應盡快向估價署舉報涉嫌違規個案。舉報渠道包括電話熱線（2150 8303）、電郵（enquiries@rvd.gov.hk）、傳真（2116 4920）、郵寄（九龍長沙灣道303號長沙灣政府合署15樓）或親身到訪（香港灣仔告士打道7號入境事務大樓38樓3816-22室，估價署租務科辦公室，到訪前請先致電2150 8303預約）。此外，估價署亦已於其網頁提供一份表格（表格AR4）（www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/tc/forms/ar4.pdf），便利分間單位租客向估價署作出舉報。

估價署提醒，根據《條例》，規管租賃的規管周期，須由該分間單位的連續兩項規管租賃（即首期租賃及次期租賃）所組成，而每項規管租賃的租期為兩年。分間單位首期租賃的租客有權獲授予有關規管周期中的次期租賃，從而享有總共四年的租住權保障。估價署陸續按照首期租賃屆滿的時間，分批發信給相關規管租賃的業主和租客並夾附有關資訊，旨在協助他們了解次期租賃的重要事項，並提醒應在擬達成的次期租賃開始前約兩個月須遵從的程序，以及在《條例》下的相關義務和權益。有關業主及租客亦可瀏覽估價署網站內的次期租賃專頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html）的相關資料，包括「一圖看清」、小冊子、教學短片及常見問題。有關業主及租客亦應熟悉相關的法定要求，以及就次期租賃保持密切溝通，並按《條例》適切處理有關事宜。

如就規管租賃事宜有疑問，可致電電話熱線（2150 8303）或瀏覽估價署網頁（www.rvd.gov.hk/tc/our_services/part_iva.html）內的相關資訊。

23 landlords of subdivided units under regulated tenancies convicted of contravening relevant statutory requirements,2025-10-03 17:23,2025-10-03 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300670.htm," Twenty-three landlords of subdivided units (SDUs), who contravened Part IVA of the Landlord and Tenant (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap. 7) (the Ordinance), pleaded guilty and were fined between $800 and $25,600, amounting to a total of $77,600, on September 19 and today (October 3) at the Eastern Magistrates' Courts. Since the Ordinance came into force, the Rating and Valuation Department (RVD) has continuously strengthened enforcement actions and has prosecuted a total of 1 229 cases to date. Among the 886 cases dealt with by the court, all were successfully convicted, which involved a total of 770 SDU landlords, amounting to a total of $2,364,110. In addition, 343 cases are pending a hearing.

  The offences of these 23 landlords include (1) failing to submit a Notice of Tenancy (Form AR2) to the Commissioner of Rating and Valuation within 60 days after the term of the regulated tenancy commenced; and (2) requesting the tenant to pay money other than the types permitted under the Ordinance (including requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance).

  The RVD earlier discovered that the landlords failed to comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance. Upon a comprehensive investigation and evidence collection, the RVD prosecuted the landlords.

  A spokesman for the RVD reiterated that SDU landlords must comply with the relevant requirements under the Ordinance, including prohibiting landlords from doing any act calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of members of the tenant's household, with the intention of causing the tenant to give up occupation of the SDU; or requiring the tenant to pay an amount of rent for the second-term tenancy exceeding the maximum amount of rent permitted under the Ordinance, and also reminded tenants of their rights under the Ordinance, including a four-year (i.e. two years plus two years) security of tenure. He also stressed that the RVD will continue to take resolute enforcement action against any contraventions of the Ordinance. Apart from following up on reported cases, the RVD has been adopting a multipronged approach to proactively identify, investigate and follow up on cases concerning landlords who are suspected of contravening the Ordinance. In particular, the RVD has been requiring landlords of regulated tenancies to provide information and reference documents of their tenancies for checking whether they have complied with the requirements of the Ordinance. If a landlord, without reasonable excuse, refuses to provide the relevant information or neglects the RVD's request, the landlord commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine at level 3 ($10,000) and to imprisonment for three months. Depending on the actual circumstances, and having regard to the information and evidence collected, the RVD will take appropriate actions on individual cases, including instigating prosecution against suspected contraventions of the Ordinance. In addition, the RVD has started a new round of publicity and education work to enhance public awareness about the key offences and penalties, emphasising that the RVD proactively checks whether landlords have committed the offences under the Ordinance.

  To help curb illegal acts as soon as possible, members of the public should report to the RVD promptly any suspected cases of contravening the relevant requirements. Reporting can be made through the telephone hotline (2150 8303), by email (enquiries@rvd.gov.hk), by fax (2116 4920), by post (15/F, Cheung Sha Wan Government Offices, 303 Cheung Sha Wan Road, Kowloon), or in person (visiting the Tenancy Services Section office of the RVD at Room 3816-22, 38/F, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wan Chai, Hong Kong, and please call 2150 8303 to make an appointment). Furthermore, the RVD has provided a form (Form AR4) (www.rvd.gov.hk/doc/en/forms/ar4.pdf) on its website to enable SDU tenants' reporting to the RVD.

  The RVD reminds that pursuant to the Ordinance, a regulated cycle of regulated tenancies is to comprise two consecutive regulated tenancies (i.e. the first-term tenancy and second-term tenancy) for an SDU, and the term of each regulated tenancy is two years. A tenant of a first-term tenancy for an SDU is entitled to be granted a second-term tenancy of the regulated cycle, thus enjoying a total of four years of security of tenure. The RVD has been issuing letters enclosing relevant information to the landlords and tenants concerned of regulated tenancies in batches, according to the expiry time of their first-term tenancies, to assist them in understanding the important matters pertaining to the second-term tenancy, and to remind them about the procedures that need to be followed about two months prior to the commencement of the purported second-term tenancy as well as their respective obligations and rights under the Ordinance. These landlords and tenants may also visit the dedicated page for the second-term tenancy on the RVD's website (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/tenancy_matters/second_term_tenancy.html) for the relevant information, including a concise guide, brochures, tutorial videos and frequently asked questions. The landlords and tenants concerned are also advised to familiarise themselves with the relevant statutory requirements and maintain close communication regarding the second-term tenancy for handling the matters properly and in a timely manner according to the Ordinance.

  For enquiries related to regulated tenancies, please call the telephone hotline (2150 8303) or visit the RVD's webpage (www.rvd.gov.hk/en/our_services/part_iva.html) for the relevant information."

發展局局長出席立法會發展事務委員會政策簡報會開場發言（只有中文）,2025-10-03 17:09,2025-10-03 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300661.htm,"以下是發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十月三日）出席立法會發展事務委員會政策簡報會簡介《行政長官2025年施政報告》有關發展局政策措施的開場發言：

主席：

正如主席剛才提到，我相信各位議員都知道《施政報告》中土地發展方面的主要措施，所以我稍後不會另外邀請同事簡介投影片，由我很快地利用投影片點題。

造地

首先和造地有關，為了讓社會掌握由政府主導的造地項目，未來十年「熟地」預測完成量，我們每年都會更新這個圖表。這次最新一次的更新，我們預計未來十年的「熟地」完成量大約為2 600公頃，當中約七成，即約1 800公頃來自北部都會區。過去幾年我們每年都有作十年預測，幾年過去了，我們有沒有做到當年預測的數字呢，答案是有的。單看還未完結、即將完結的二○二五／二六年度，去年預測今個財政年度產出150公頃「熟地」，我們相信會如期做到。

加快發展北都

既然未來十年有七成「熟地」來自北部都會區，正正顯示北都將大舉進入建設階段，所以我們在這個階段要聚焦吸引企業參與建設和吸引產業進駐，因此行政長官在《施政報告》提出三方面的措施：

（一） 強化治理體系：成立由行政長官主持的「北都發展委員會」，以及下設三個小組，都顯示出我剛才提到進入建設階段需要聚焦的工作。

（二） 訂立專屬法例：授權政府可以簡化法定程序，包括成立法定園區公司及有關的撥款安排，亦希望促進四流，即人流、物流、資金流、數據流的跨境流動。我們希望明年初進行諮詢，年中左右向立法會提交條例草案，爭取明年內通過，這是一個比較進取的時間表。

（三） 拆牆鬆綁、促進公私營合作：我們知道北都這麼大型的項目，單靠政府是不足夠的。正如這個投影片所列，我們會致力簡化土地行政程序，例如採用多元的發展模式、靈活的地價計算和政府租約安排等，希望鼓勵企業一起參與建設。

除了加快北都發展，我們亦會推進其他大型造地項目，包括重新規劃屯門西及龍鼓灘填海、將軍澳第137區和第132區，以及東涌新市鎮擴展。單是這三個項目，在未來十年將產出約270公頃「熟地」，已計入我剛才提及的「熟地」預測完成量。

助力產業發展

另一個大的主線是我們會繼續透過發展工作，助力產業發展。北都以外，我們亦提出擴展「城中學舍計劃」，早前亦已向委員會簡介，非常受歡迎，所以《施政報告》提出再擴展這個計劃。另外，我們亦會繼續向前推進遊艇泊位建設項目，即前南丫石礦場，希望明年內正式進行招標；另外有香港仔避風塘擴建部分和紅磡站臨海用地這三個項目。同時，為響應「無處不旅遊」的方針，我們亦會探討合適措施以豐富鄉郊生態遊體驗。我們相信明年初會再向發展事務委員會匯報城鄉共融相關研究的建議。我們亦會統籌部門以蘭桂坊作為一個試點——除了關注新發展區，舊區亦有一些標誌性區域，我們希望以蘭桂坊作為試點，更新整個微觀上的城市設計元素。

市區更新

這便帶入市區更新這個重要環節。我們在《施政報告》提出了三項措施：分別是：（一）讓市區重建局（市建局）利用新發展區土地資源支援舊區重建項目；（二）放寬目前同區地積比率轉移安排，容許跨區轉移一些原址重建時未能盡用的地積比，這適用於整個市場，不單是市建局；（三）為七個重建需要特別高的區域，引入額外增加地積比的安排，甚至容許將這些額外增加的地積比轉為金額用作抵銷補地價，務求推動市場參與市區重建。發展局已預告會於十月十三日的發展事務委員會會議上，趁着我們年度報告市區更新的工作，再詳細講解這三項措施。除住宅用地，我們在《施政報告》也提到會開展新一輪工業用地研究，探討活化工廈計劃的未來路向，爭取明年內提出建議。

減低建造成本、提振工程量

上述一系列措施有一個主要脈絡，一方面拆牆鬆綁和提速，同時希望促進私營界別參與發展，因為政府和市場的力量合併才可以事半功倍。我們現時建造業近一兩年在私營工程量方面是慢了些，基於房地產市場的情況，所以我們剛才提出的一系列措施，希望有另一個作用，就是激活私營市場的工程量，希望對建造業的健康發展有幫助。承接着這個脈絡，我們亦着力減低建造成本，包括加速大型項目審批、進一步放寬停車場豁免樓面安排、檢視建造設計和物料標準、試行中央採購、善用AI科技等等。

另外，政府年初公布政府未來五年的基本工程開支由平均每年900億增加至平均每年1,200億，這實實在在的增幅對建造業發展至為重要。《施政報告》進一步加大力度，表明未來兩至三年額外預留300億，我們部署使用這筆額外撥款時，會特別留意投資小型工程，協助建造業的中小企。

主席，我的簡單點題到此，我和團隊樂意回答大家的提問。"

A stormy and hot September,2025-10-03 17:00,2025-10-03 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300586.htm,"September 2025 was marked by the successive strikes of tropical cyclones Tapah, Mitag and Ragasa. The ferocious strike of Super Typhoon Ragasa necessitated the issuance of the Hurricane Signal No. 10 on September 24 once again after Typhoon Wipha, tying the record of issuing the No. 10 Signal twice in the same year since 1964. Despite the succession of tropical cyclones affecting Hong Kong, September 2025 was hotter than usual in Hong Kong, mainly attributed to the warmer than normal sea surface temperature and stronger than usual southerly flow in the lower atmosphere over the northern part of the South China Sea. The monthly mean minimum temperature of 27.3 was 1.2 degrees above the normal and one of the second-highest on record for September. The monthly mean maximum temperature of 32.2 degrees and mean temperature of 29.3 degrees were respectively 1.7 degrees and 1.4 degrees above their corresponding normals and both the third highest on record for September. There were in total 13 hot nights, breaking the previous record set in September 2021. The 15 very hot days in the month was also one of the highest records for September. Mainly due to the passage of tropical cyclones, the monthly rainfall was 528.7 millimetres, about 64 per cent above the normal of 321.4 millimetres. The accumulated rainfall this year up to September was 2 514.0 millimetres, about 12 per cent above the normal of 2 242.8 millimetres for the same period.

Under the influence of an anticyclonic aloft, apart from isolated thunderstorms on September 2 and 3, the local weather was generally fine with prolonged heat on the first six days of the month. The maximum temperature at the Observatory rose to 35.3 degrees on the afternoon of September 5, the highest of the month. Moreover, the Tropical depression Tapah formed near Luzon on September 5. It tracked west-northwestwards across the central and northern parts of the South China Sea and intensified into a tropical storm on September 6. Tapah turned north-northwestwards towards the western coast of Guangdong on September 7 and further intensified into a severe tropical storm that night. Tapah made landfall near Taishan of Guangdong and then moved into inland Guangxi the next day. Locally, the weather was mainly cloudy with occasional squally showers and thunderstorms on September 7. The strike of Tapah necessitated the issuance of the No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal that night. Gale force winds prevailed over many places, with winds reaching storm force offshore and on high ground at first on September 8. The rainbands of Tapah also brought heavy squally showers to the territory. More than 100 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over many places on September 8.

An active southerly airstream brought occasional showers and isolated thunderstorms to Hong Kong on September 9. More than 30 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over New Territories West. Under the influence of the subtropical ridge, apart from a few showers on September 10, local weather was generally fine and very hot from September 10 to 14.

Affected by an upper-air disturbance, while it remained very hot from September 15 to 17, it was mainly cloudy with a few showers and thunderstorms. Showers were heavier on the morning of September 17 with more than 30 millimetres of rainfall recorded over Hong Kong Island and Tseung Kwan O. Under the influence of an anticyclone aloft, apart from a few showers and isolated thunderstorms, it was very hot with sunny periods on September 18.

As well, tropical depression Mitag tracked northwestwards across the northeastern part of the South China Sea on September 17 and intensified into a tropical storm the next day. It further intensified into a severe tropical storm on September 19 and made landfall near Shanwei of Guangdong that afternoon. Under the influence of the northeast monsoon, Mitag then gradually turned to move westwards across the northern part of the Pearl River Estuary and weakened into an area of low pressure over inland Guangdong on September 20. Locally, it was mainly cloudy with a few squally showers on September 19. Mitag and its remnant brought heavy showers and squally thunderstorms to Hong Kong on the following two days. More than 250 millimetres were recorded over Hong Kong Island and the eastern part of the New Territories, and rainfall even exceeded 300 millimetres over Lantau Island on these two days.

Furthermore, tropical cyclone Ragasa formed over the western North Pacific to the east of the Philippines on September 18. It moved west-northwestwards on the next three days and intensified progressively into a super typhoon. Ragasa moved across Luzon Strait on September 22 and continued to track west-northwestwards across the northern part of the South China Sea the next day, edging closer to the coast of Guangdong. Ragasa skirted about 120 kilometers south of Hong Kong with super typhoon intensity on the morning of September 24. It made landfall over Yangjiang of Guangdong that afternoon and weakened. Ragasa then moved across the coast of Guangxi and the vicinity of the northern part of Vietnam the next day, and dissipated gradually at night. Locally, under the influence of Ragasa's outer subsiding air, it was very hot with sunny periods on September 22. As Ragasa came closer to Hong Kong, winds strengthened progressively the next day and squally showers set in later in the afternoon. Under the influence of Ragasa's extensive circulation with fierce winds, storm to hurricane force winds affected many places in Hong Kong on September 24. The maximum 60-minute mean wind speeds recorded at Waglan Island and Cheung Chau were 133 km/h and 114 km/h respectively. There were also frequent heavy squally showers and more than 200 millimetres of rainfall were generally recorded over the territory on that day. As the approach of Ragasa coincided with the astronomical high tide, storm surge induced by Ragasa resulted in unusually high water level in many parts of the territory. The sea level at Quarry Bay rose to a maximum of 3.4 metres above chart datum, close to the level when Super Typhoon Hato hit Hong Kong in 2017. The fierce winds of Ragasa also triggered overtopping waves, causing flooding in many parts of the coastal areas of Hong Kong. According to preliminary reports, at least 101 people were injured during the passage of Ragasa. A woman and her son were swept away by swells at the waterfront of Chai Wan and were later rescued. There were at least 1 224 reports of fallen trees, 22 reports of flooding and four reports of landslides. Under the influence of the outer rainbands associated with Ragasa, there were still a few showers and isolated thunderstorms on September 25.

Under the influence of a northeast monsoon and the subsequent anticyclone aloft, apart from a few showers, local weather was generally fine and hot on the last five days of the month.

Six tropical cyclones occurred over the South China Sea and the western North Pacific in September 2025.

Details of issuance and cancellation of various warnings/signals in the month are summarised in Table 1. Monthly meteorological figures and departures from normal for September are tabulated in Table 2."

風雨連場及炎熱的九月,2025-10-03 17:00,2025-10-03 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300582.htm,"二○二五年九月香港接連受熱帶氣旋塔巴、米娜及樺加沙影響。超強颱風樺加沙猛烈吹襲本港，令天文台在九月二十四日繼颱風韋帕後再度需要發出十號颶風信號，追平自一九六四年以來年內兩度發出十號信號的紀錄。雖然接連受熱帶氣旋影響，二○二五年九月本港仍較正常炎熱，主要由於南海北部海面溫度較正常暖及大氣低層的偏南氣流較正常強。該月平均最低氣溫27.3度，較正常值高1.2度，是有紀錄以來九月份的其中一個第二高；平均最高氣溫32.2度及平均氣溫29.3度，分別較正常值高1.7度及1.4度，兩者皆是九月份第三高的紀錄。九月共錄得13個熱夜，打破二○二一年九月創下的紀錄。而酷熱天氣日數為15天，亦是有紀錄以來九月份的其中一個最多。主要由於受熱帶氣旋影響，全月總雨量為528.7毫米，較正常值321.4毫米多約百分之六十四。本年首九個月的累積雨量為2 514.0毫米，較正常值2 242.8毫米多約百分之十二。

受高空反氣旋影響，除九月二日至三日局部地區有雷暴外，九月首六日本港普遍天晴及持續酷熱。天文台氣溫於九月五日下午上升至全月最高的35.3度。此外，熱帶低氣壓塔巴於九月五日在呂宋附近形成，隨後向西北偏西移動，橫過南海中北部，並於九月六日增強為熱帶風暴。塔巴於九月七日轉向西北偏北移向廣東西部沿岸，並在當晚進一步增強為強烈熱帶風暴。塔巴翌日在廣東台山附近登陸，隨後移入廣西內陸。九月七日本港大致多雲，間中有狂風驟雨及雷暴。塔巴襲港令天文台需要在當晚發出八號烈風或暴風信號。九月八日初時本港多處吹烈風，離岸及高地達暴風程度。塔巴的雨帶亦為本港帶來狂風大驟雨，九月八日多處地區錄得超過100毫米雨量。

受一股活躍偏南氣流影響，九月九日本港間中有驟雨及局部地區有雷暴，新界西錄得超過30毫米雨量。受副熱帶高壓脊影響，除九月十日有幾陣驟雨外，九月十日至十四日本港天氣普遍天晴及酷熱。

受高空擾動影響，雖然九月十五日至十七日天氣仍然酷熱，但大致多雲及有幾陣驟雨和雷暴。九月十七日早上雨勢較大，港島及將軍澳錄得超過30毫米雨量。受高空反氣旋影響，除有幾陣驟雨及局部地區有雷暴外，九月十八日天氣酷熱及部分時間有陽光。

此外，熱帶低氣壓米娜於九月十七日向西北移動，橫過南海東北部，並於翌日增強為熱帶風暴。米娜於九月十九日進一步增強為強烈熱帶風暴，並在當日下午於廣東汕尾附近登陸。受東北季候風影響，米娜隨後逐漸轉向偏西方向橫過珠江口北部，並於九月二十日在廣東內陸減弱為低壓區。九月十九日本港大致多雲及有幾陣狂風驟雨。米娜及其殘餘在隨後兩日為本港帶來大驟雨及狂風雷暴。在這兩日，港島及新界東部錄得超過250毫米雨量，而大嶼山的雨量更超過300毫米。

另外，熱帶氣旋樺加沙於九月十八日在菲律賓以東的西北太平洋形成。樺加沙在隨後三日向西北偏西移動，並逐步增強為超強颱風。樺加沙於九月二十二日橫過呂宋海峽，翌日繼續向西北偏西移動，橫過南海北部，靠近廣東沿岸。樺加沙在九月二十四日早上以超強颱風強度在香港以南約120公里掠過。樺加沙於當日下午在廣東陽江登陸並減弱，翌日橫過廣西沿岸及越南北部一帶，並於當晚逐漸消散。本港方面，受樺加沙的外圍下沉氣流影響，九月二十二日天氣酷熱及部分時間有陽光。隨着樺加沙靠近本港，翌日風勢逐步增強，下午稍後開始有狂風驟雨。受樺加沙的廣闊環流及猛烈風力影響，九月二十四日本港多處受暴風至颶風影響。橫瀾島及長洲錄得的最高60分鐘平均風速分別為每小時133公里及114公里。當日亦有頻密狂風大驟雨，本港普遍錄得超過200毫米雨量。由於樺加沙接近本港時正值天文漲潮，其引致的風暴潮導致本港多處水位較正常潮位高。鰂魚涌的最高水位上升至海圖基準面以上3.4米，接近超強颱風天鴿於二○一七年襲港時的水位。樺加沙的猛烈風力亦引發越堤浪，導致本港沿岸多處地區出現水浸。根據初步報告，樺加沙吹襲期間至少有101人受傷，一名女子及其兒子在柴灣海濱被湧浪捲走，隨後獲救。全港有至少1 224宗樹木倒塌報告、22宗水浸報告及四宗山泥傾瀉報告。受樺加沙相關的外圍雨帶影響，九月二十五日本港仍有幾陣驟雨及局部地區有雷暴。

受一股東北季候風及隨後的高空反氣旋影響，九月最後五日除有幾陣驟雨外，本港普遍天晴及炎熱。

二○二五年九月有六個熱帶氣旋影響南海及北太平洋西部。

Some 30 officers from the FEHD, the Environment and Ecology Bureau and the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong) (NGCO) participated in the exercise.

To ensure food safety throughout the Games, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the FEHD has commenced a series of preparatory measures since last year. These included the formulation of the Food Safety Preparedness and Response Plan, enhancing food surveillance, and organising food safety seminars for the trade. The Environmental Hygiene Branch of the FEHD has also stepped up inspections of food premises associated with the Games to establish a stronger food safety safeguard.

The drill simulated a suspected food complaint and poisoning case involving related personnel during the Games. Upon receiving the report, the FEHD fully activated the Departmental Emergency Coordinating Centre (DECC) in accordance with the Plan, conducted investigations at the relevant food premises, and implemented control measures to safeguard food safety. The DECC also co-ordinated communication and collaboration with the NGCO and other relevant parties.

âThe Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene, Mr Donald Ng, said the drill has reinforced the emergency response capabilities of the FEHD and other relevant departments. The FEHD will work closely with the trade to ensure food safety throughout the NG, the NGD and the NSOG."

Both patients had underlying illnesses. The CHP appealed to members of the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent melioidosis. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

The first case involves a 76-year-old male who resided in Sham Shui Po. On September 26, he presented with a fever and shortness of breath. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centreon the same day and was admitted for treatment. The clinical diagnosis wassepsis. He passed away on September 28 due to sepsis and underlying medical conditions.

The second case involves a 68-year-old male who lives in Sham Shui Po. He presented with malaise since September 18. On September 23, he attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre as he developed a fever and was admitted for treatment on the same day. The clinical diagnosis was sepsis. He is in stable condition.

The clinical samples of the two cases were confirmed to be positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei upon testing. The CHP is investigating the infection source of the cases. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

As of October 2, 13 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.


 âThe CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

衞生防護中心公布新增兩宗類鼻疽個案,2025-10-03 16:45,2025-10-03 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/03/P2025100300584.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月三日）表示，過去一星期（九月二十六日至十月二日）錄得兩宗新增類鼻疽個案，兩名患者均有長期病患。中心呼籲市民保持個人及環境衞生以預防類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

首宗個案涉及一名居於深水埗的76歲男子。他自九月二十六日出現發燒和氣促，同日到明愛醫院急症室求診，並入院接受治療，臨床診斷為敗血症。病人於九月二十八日因敗血症及自身長期病患去世。

第二宗個案涉及一名68歲男子，亦居於深水埗。他自九月十八日出現全身乏力，並於九月二十三日發燒，同日到明愛醫院急症室求診，並入院接受治療，臨床診斷為敗血症。病人現時情況穩定。

兩宗個案的臨床樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。中心正調查個案的感染源頭和進行流行病學調查。

截至十月二日，本港今年錄得13宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"
