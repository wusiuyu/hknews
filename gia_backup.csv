The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, said, ""The Infrastructure Bond Report 2025 provides comprehensive information on the allocation of proceeds raised from the Infrastructure Bond Programme. The funds raised are credited to the Capital Works Reserve Fund for investment in infrastructure projects, such as accelerating the development of the Northern Metropolis, to facilitate the early completion of projects for the good of the economy and people's livelihood, thereby enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness. Infrastructure bonds also provide a safe and reliable investment option with steady returns for the public, as well as a greater 'sense of participation' and 'sense of gain' in support of infrastructure projects for Hong Kong's long-term development.""

The proceeds raised by the Government through issuances of infrastructure bonds have been fully allocated or earmarked for infrastructure projects, including 10 major infrastructure projects in the Northern Metropolis, such as San Tin Technopole (including the Loop), Kwu Tung North/Fanling North New Development Area (NDA), Hung Shui Kiu/Ha Tsuen NDA and Yuen Long South NDA.

消防處與醫院管理局合作推行「院前中風分流計劃」,2025-12-12 16:18,2025-12-12 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200540.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

消防處與醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（十二月十二日）宣布，將於十二月十五日上午八時三十分起在醫管局新界東醫院聯網（新界東聯網）及新界西醫院聯網（新界西聯網）推行「院前中風分流計劃」。

自二○二一年起，醫管局與消防處合作在全港推行「院前中風通報」機制。消防處救護人員會在患者送抵醫院前進行「院前中風評估」，利用標準化的醫療評估判斷患者有否出現懷疑急性中風症狀。若患者被評估為需要通報個案，救護人員會立即致電相關的公立醫院急症室，以便醫院的中風科團隊提前安排檢查及治療。

按照行政長官在二○二五年《施政報告》中提出強化中風緊急救治服務網絡及進一步完善服務流程，從而提升中風病人存活率和功能恢復的目標，消防處與醫管局將加強合作，在新界東及新界西聯網率先推行「院前中風分流計劃」。在計劃下，經救護人員初步評估屬懷疑患有大血管閉塞的患者，將會直接送往所屬服務範圍的醫管局聯網指定醫院盡早接受治療，即沙田、大埔及北區的患者，會直接送往新界東聯網的威爾斯親王醫院；而位於屯門及元朗區的患者，則會直接送往新界西聯網的屯門醫院。透過在院前階段及早分流至具備相應治療服務的指定醫院，可避免患者需轉院及重複評估的情況，進一步縮短整體治療時間，為患者爭取更多黃金時間，減低腦損傷和長期殘疾的風險。

懷疑患有大血管閉塞的患者，在抵達公立醫院急症室後，會隨即接受相關檢查及診斷，如果證實患上大血管閉塞，中風科團隊會按照患者的臨床情況提供合適的治療，包括透過靜脈注射溶栓劑（溶栓治療）清除血塊；如果臨床條件合適，亦可接受動脈內取栓手術治療（取栓手術），以期盡快恢復血管向腦部供血。現時威爾斯親王醫院及屯門醫院除了提供溶栓治療外，亦提供取栓手術及相關配套服務，如果將懷疑患有大血管閉塞的中風患者直接送到兩間指定醫院，醫護人員可以盡快安排有關檢查及手術，縮短腦部缺血的時間，提升治療效果。至於其他聯網的中風患者，消防處的救護人員會繼續採用行之有效的「院前中風通報」機制，盡快通知及將患者送往公立醫院急症室接受治療。

醫管局發言人提醒市民，現時所有公立醫院急症室均可為中風患者安排合適的治療，市民如果懷疑自己或身邊人中風，應盡快到就近的急症室就診，醫護人員會立即安排相關評估和檢查。市民如果召喚消防處救護服務，亦應配合救護人員的專業評估及決定，救護人員會將患者送到合適的醫院作進一步診斷。

為確保「院前中風分流計劃」能夠順利推行，醫管局及消防處早前已進行多次演練。雙方將密切監察計劃進展及檢討成效，持續提升處理中風患者的效率，並積極考慮將計劃有序地推展至其他聯網。

中風大致可分為出血性中風及缺血性中風兩種不同類型，兩類型中風患者有不同的治療方法。就缺血性中風而言，目前所有公立醫院急症室均可24小時安排提供靜脈溶栓治療；而自本年三月起，威爾斯親王醫院、屯門醫院、瑪嘉烈醫院、伊利沙伯醫院、廣華醫院、瑪麗醫院及東區尤德夫人那打素醫院亦已提供24小時動脈內取栓手術服務，透過服務網絡全天候支援全港各區的中風患者。"
Fire Services Department and Hospital Authority to launch Pre-hospital Stroke Diversion Scheme,2025-12-12 16:18,2025-12-12 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200541.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

TheFire Services Department(FSD)and the Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (December 12) that the Pre-hospital Stroke Diversion Scheme (Primary Diversion Scheme) will be launched starting from 8.30am on December 15 in the New Territories East Cluster (NTEC) and the New Territories West Cluster (NTWC) of the HA.

Since 2021, the HA and the FSD have collaborated to implement the Pre-hospital Stroke Notification mechanism on a territory-wide basis. The FSD's ambulance personnel will perform a pre-hospital stroke assessment before patients arrive at the hospital, utilising standardised medical evaluations to determine if the patient exhibits suspected acute stroke symptoms. In case a patient is assessed as requiring notification, the ambulance personnel will immediately call the Accident and Emergency Department (AED) of the public hospital concerned, enabling the hospital's stroke team to make advance arrangements for examination and treatment.

In line with the objectives set out by the Chief Executive in the 2025 Policy Address on strengthening the emergency stroke service network and further optimising service workflows to improve patients' survival rate and functional recovery, the FSD and the HA will strengthen collaboration and initiate to implement the Primary Diversion Scheme in the NTEC and the NTWC. Under the scheme, patients preliminarily assessed by ambulance personnel as having suspected large vessel occlusion (LVO) will be directly conveyed to designated HA hospitals within the service catchment areas for early treatment. Specifically, patients from Sha Tin, Tai Po and North districts will be taken to Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) in the NTEC, while those from Tuen Mun and Yuen Long districts will be sent directly to Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) in the NTWC. By triaging patients promptly at the pre-hospital stage and conveying them directly to designated hospitals capable of providing appropriate treatment services, the scheme can avoid the need for inter-hospital transfers and repeated assessments, further shortening the overall time for treatment, gaining more ""golden time"" for patients and reducing their risk of brain damage and long-term disability.

Suspected LVO patients will receive immediate examinations and diagnosis upon arrival at the public hospital AED. If LVO is confirmed, the stroke team will provide suitable treatments based on the patient's clinical condition, which may include intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) to dissolve blood clots. If clinically appropriate, patients may also receive intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) surgery to restore blood flow to the brain as quickly as possible. Currently, PWH and TMH offer both IVT and IAT along with related support services. By directing suspected LVO patients to these two designated hospitals, healthcare staff can promptly arrange necessary examinations and procedures, thereby reducing the duration of cerebral ischemia and improving treatment outcomes. For stroke patients in other Clusters, the FSD's ambulance personnel will continue to swiftly convey patients to the public hospital AED for treatment in accordance with the established Pre-hospital Stroke Notification mechanism.

The HA spokesperson reminded the public that all public hospital AEDs are capable of providing appropriate treatment for stroke patients. If individuals suspect themselves or someone nearby are suffering from stroke, they should promptly attend the nearest AED, where healthcare staff will arrange necessary assessments and examinations. Members of the public calling the FSD's ambulance service for assistance are also advised to co-operate with the professional assessments and judgments conducted by the ambulance personnel, who will convey patients to a suitable hospital for further diagnosis.

To ensure the smooth implementation of the Primary Diversion Scheme, the HA and the FSD have conducted multiple drills in advance. Both parties will closely monitor the progress of the Scheme and review its effectiveness to continuously enhance the efficiency of stroke patient management and actively consider extending the Scheme to other Clusters in an orderly manner.

Strokes can be generally classified into two types, namely hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. Treatment approaches differ for patients with each type. For ischemic strokes, all public hospital AEDs currently offer 24-hour IVT services. Since March of this year, PWH, TMH, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital have also been providing 24-hour IAT services, supporting stroke patients across Hong Kong through a comprehensive service network."

Grading of beach water quality released,2025-12-12 16:00,2025-12-12 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200350.htm,"  The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) today (December 12) released the latest grading of water quality for six gazetted beaches that are open all year round for swimming.

  Four beaches were rated as Good (Grade 1), and two as Fair (Grade 2).

Grade 1 beaches are:



Clear Water Bay Second Beach
Golden Beach


Deep Water Bay Beach
Silverstrand Beach




Grade 2 beaches are:



Casam Beach
Lido Beach




  Compared with the grading released last week, there was no change in the grading for these beaches.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666.

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-12-12 15:50,2025-12-12 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200555.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on December 11 to noon today (December 12), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 253 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website (www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 187 927 samples of food imported from Japan (including 121 688 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 41 764 samples of local catch respectively.

香港海關提醒市民留意一款不安全磁吸無線充電座（附圖）,2025-12-12 15:40,2025-12-12 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200484.htm,"香港海關今日（十二月十二日）提醒市民留意一款有過熱及引致燒傷潛在危險的磁吸無線充電座，並呼籲市民停用有關產品。

海關早前接獲舉報指一款充電座有過熱問題，遂試購該款充電座作安全測試，結果發現該款充電座在使用無線充電功能時，如有金屬外物放置於充電座和被充電裝置之間，該外物的溫度測試結果達攝氏148.1度，超過允許限值（即攝氏85度），充電座亦會出現過熱情況，未能通過燒傷測試，因而不符合國際相關安全標準，涉嫌違反《消費品安全條例》（《條例》）。

海關人員其後採取行動，搜查涉案的一間零售商，行動中未再有發現該款充電座。人員已向有關零售商發出禁制通知書，禁止繼續出售該款懷疑不安全的充電座。

此外，海關人員亦到全港各區進行巡查，暫沒有再發現該款充電座出售。案件仍在調查中。

海關建議市民，於選購及使用充電座時，應注意以下安全事項：


選購由商譽良好的品牌原廠生產並設有短路保護裝置的充電座，包括防止過度充電、過高電流及過熱電池溫度保護裝置，以及配置原廠正貨的充電線；




使用充電座前，須先閱讀說明書，以了解正確的使用方法；




將充電座放置於空氣流通的地方充電，以避免阻礙充電座散熱，增加充電座短路着火的風險，正在充電的裝置亦不應擺近衣物等易燃物品；




保持充電座及供電裝置清潔及切勿在無線充電期間放置任何物件於充電座及被充電裝置之間；




避免長時間充電。當被充電裝置完全充電後，應拔走插頭，避免充電座過熱而導致意外；




充電座及供電裝置在使用時應放在視線範圍內；




避免使用充電座同時為多於一個裝置充電，以免充電座超出負荷，引致燃燒；及




若發現充電座損壞、散發高熱、有異常噪音／氣味／震動，應立即停用，並把充電座及電源拔掉。


海關一直致力保障消費者的權益，不時在市場巡查及抽取消費品樣本進行安全測試，以確保消費品達到合理的安全程度。

海關同時提醒商戶，須遵從《條例》的規定，以保障消費者安全。根據《條例》，任何人士不得供應、製造或進口消費品，除非該等消費品符合《條例》的一般安全規定。違例者首次定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁一年，而其後各次定罪則最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/）舉報懷疑違反《條例》的活動。"
Hong Kong Customs alerts public to unsafe magnetic wireless charging stand (with photo),2025-12-12 15:40,2025-12-12 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200485.htm,"Hong Kong Customs today (December 12) alerted members of the public to a potential thermal burn injury posed by one model of a magnetic wireless charging stand (charging stand), and advised them to stop using the products.

Customs earlier received information alleging that a charging stand had an overheating problem, and then test-purchased that model of charging stand for safety testing. Testing results revealed that when using the wireless charging function, if a metal foreign object is placed between the charging stand and the device being charged, the temperature of the foreign object could reach 148.1 degrees Celsius, exceeding the permissible limit of 85 degrees C. Overheating was also observed in the charging stand. Therefore, the product did not comply with relevant international product safety standards, and is suspected to be in contravention of the Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance (CGSO).

Customs officers later conducted an operation and searched the premises of the retailer involved in the case. No charging stand concerned was found. A prohibition notice was then served to the subject retailer, prohibiting the sale of the suspected unsafe charging stand concerned.

Furthermore, Customs officers have conducted spot checks and inspections in various districts and have not found any sales of the charging stand concerned so far. The investigation is ongoing.

Customs reminds members of the public to adhere to following safety tips when purchasing and using charging stands:


Purchase charging stands manufactured by reputable brands and equipped with short-circuit protection devices, as well as overcharging, overcurrent and overheated battery temperature protection devices, and choose charger cables produced by original manufacturers;




Read the user manual before using the charging stand to understand how to use it properly;




Ensure the charging stand is placed in a well-ventilated area to avoid obstructing heat dissipation from the charging stand and to minimise the risk of a short circuit. Devices being charged should not be placed near inflammable substances such as clothes;




Keep the charging stand and chargers clean, and do not place any objects between the charging stand and the device being charged during wireless charging;




Avoid prolonged charging. Once the device being charged is fully charged, unplug it to prevent the charging stand from overheating and causing accidents;




Place the charging stand and chargers in use within sight;




Do not use the charging stand to charge more than one device at the same time to avoid overloading and combustion; and




If the charging stand is found to be damaged, or is overheating or making any abnormal noise/smell/vibration, stop using it immediately and unplug it.


Customs is committed to the protection of consumer interests and regularly conducts spot checks and safety tests on consumer goods to ensure that they are reasonably safe for use by consumers.
 
Customs also reminds traders to comply with the statutory requirements of the CGSO to protect the safety of consumers. Under the CGSO, it is an offence to supply, manufacture or import into Hong Kong consumer goods unless the goods comply with the general safety requirements for consumer goods. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for one year on first conviction, and $500,000 and imprisonment for two years on subsequent conviction.

Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the CGSO to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."

Opening remarks by SITI at Hong Kong Science Summit (English only) (with photo),2025-12-12 10:56,2025-12-12 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200268.htm,"  Following are the opening remarks by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, at the Hong Kong Science Summit today (December 12):

Professor Dennis Lo (President of the Hong Kong Academy of Sciences), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my great pleasure to join you all today at the Hong Kong Science Summit. This summit gathers distinguished scientists and academic leaders from around the world to exchange views on the latest global scientific developments. Science and technology are instrumental for scientific progress. I am glad that we are here together to build a better future for the younger generations and make Hong Kong, and even this world, a better place in our pursuit for scientific discoveries and technological breakthroughs.

  In recent years, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has been investing vigorously in innovation and technology (I&T). With three major I&T parks and five key research and development institutions as the framework, we are poised to promote the co-ordinated development of, and positive interaction among, the research and development in the upstream, technology transfer in the midstream and development of industry in the downstream. We hope to leverage Hong Kong's traditional strengths in research and development to drive industrial innovation and build a healthy I&T ecosystem.

  Our efforts are gradually bearing fruit. With the staunch support of our country, as well as our close collaboration with neighboring cities, the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster has ranked first for the first time in the 2025 Global Innovation Index Ranking of the World's Top 100 Innovation Clusters. Riding on our tremendous potential in technology development, Hong Kong also rose to rank fourth globally in digital competitiveness in the latest World Digital Competitiveness Ranking 2025. These achievements are a testament to our dedication and the innovative spirit of our city, laying a robust foundation for high-quality development.

  To keep up the momentum, we are expediting the development of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen I&T Park in the Loop, with a view to joining hands with Shenzhen to create an international talent hub. Together with Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, the Hong Kong Park in the Loop would further propel our I&T development. The Government has also been bolstering its efforts to nurture local talents and attract overseas and Mainland professionals. The existing two InnoHK research clusters, namely AIR@InnoHK and Health@InnoHK, have already pooled over 3000 experts from around the globe. Building on the success of the two clusters, we are taking forward the establishment of the third InnoHK research cluster, namely SEAM@InnoHK. This new cluster will focus on research areas such as sustainable development, energy, advanced manufacturing, and materials, and is expected to broaden our high-calibre talent pool. We have also launched the $3billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme in September this year to provide funding support to universities in attracting international top-notch scientific researchers to Hong Kong, so as to spearhead basic research in frontier technologies. These recent measures signify our commitment to developing Hong Kong as an international I&T centre and talent hub.

  Hong Kong's development is underpinned by our unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, which makes us the only world city which enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage. With the enormous opportunities arising from the development of the Greater Bay Area, we are at the dawn of an unprecedented golden era for Hong Kong's I&T development. Nurturing young talents is vital to bringing Hong Kong's I&T development to a whole new level. The Hong Kong Academy of Sciences, including its Hong Kong Young Academy of Sciences, has been our close partner in empowering the next generation of scientists. As this year marks an important milestone of the 10th anniversary of the Academy, let us continue to join hands in building a vibrant I&T ecosystem and nurturing more talents who will contribute to the high-quality development of both Hong Kong and the country.

  In closing, may I wish you all a fruitful and inspiring experience at the summit. Thank you."

HKSAR Government strongly disapproves and rejects report of US Congressional-Executive Commission on China,2025-12-12 00:30,2025-12-12 01:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/12/P2025121200009.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) yesterday (December 11) strongly disapproved and opposed the so-called ""2025 Annual Report"" issued by the United States (US) Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), which made biased, slandering and smearing remarks against the situation in the HKSAR.

A HKSAR Government spokesperson said, ""The HKSAR Government strongly disapproves and opposes the CECC's repeated tactics to interfere in the affairs of the HKSAR through the so-called annual report, and make slandering remarks against Hong Kong, where 'one country, two systems' is successfully implemented. The US is once again overriding the rule of law with politics and making unfounded and fact-twisting remarks. Such attempt to undermine the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and interfere in Hong Kong's law-based governance is doomed to fail.""

The spokesperson reiterated, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards national sovereignty, security and development interests, and fully and faithfully lives up to the highest principle of 'one country, two systems'. It will resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL), the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) and other relevant laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security in accordance with the law, whilst maintaining the common law system, adhering to the principle of the rule of law and upholding the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly demands the US to immediately stop acting against the international law and basic norms of international relations and interfering in China's internal affairs and Hong Kong affairs.""

Regarding the slandering remarks in the US' so-called report and the relevant statement about the HKSAR, the Government solemnly rejects them in the ensuing paragraphs.

Safeguarding National Security

The HKSAR Government spokesperson said, ""The HKSAR Government strongly opposes the absurd and untrue content regarding legislation safeguarding national security in the HKSAR contained in the US' so-called report. In accordance with international law and international practice based on the Charter of the United Nations, safeguarding national security is an inherent right of all sovereign states. Many common law jurisdictions, including the US, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, have enacted multiple pieces of legislation and implemented measures to safeguard national security.""

""As the HKSAR Government has emphasised time and again that the laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR are precisely for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity; and ensuring the full and faithful implementation of the principle of 'one country, two systems' under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. It also better safeguards the fundamental rights and freedoms of the residents of the HKSAR and other people in the city.

""Extraterritorial effect for the offences endangering national security under the HKNSL and the SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world (including the US, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and member states of the European Union). The Police have the responsibility to pursue those who are suspected of committing offences endangering national security outside Hong Kong.

""As regards the offenses related to seditious intention, the courts of the HKSAR have ruled in different cases that the provisions relating to sedition are consistent with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on the protection of human rights, and that a proportionate and reasonable balance has been struck between safeguarding national security and protection of the freedom of speech. The offence is not meant to silence the expression of any opinion that is only genuine criticisms against the Government based on objective facts.

""The so-called US report mentioning the custodial arrangements for Jimmy Chee-ying is completely baseless. The HKSAR Government has also publicly stated on numerous occasions that the medical services received by Lai Chee-ying in custody are adequate and comprehensive. The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, as well as timely medical support. During an earlier public court hearing, senior counsel representing Lai Chee-ying clearly presented to the court that the correctional institutions had been arranging daily medical checkups for Lai Chee-ying and that there had been no complaints at all regarding the medical services he was receiving, and the Court commended the CSD. As for the arrangement for Lai Chee-ying's removal from association from other PICs (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'), it has all along been made at his own request and approved by the CSD after considering all relevant factors in accordance with the law.""

Safeguarding Due Administration of Justice and Rule of Law

The HKSAR Government emphasised that all judicial cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. All defendants will receive a fair trial strictly in accordance with laws applicable to Hong Kong (including the HKNSL and the SNSO) and as protected by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The so-called report specifically mentioned cases on offences endangering national security involving Lai Chee-ying, wantonly smearing the law enforcement, prosecution and judicial organs of the HKSAR regarding the handling of the relevant cases. Their ulterior motives are obvious, namely, to interfere with the judicial proceedings in the HKSAR by means of political power in order to procure a defendant's evasion of the criminal justice process. The HKSAR Government strongly condemned these blatant attempting to undermine the rule of law of the HKSAR.

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The Department of Justice, by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law, controls criminal prosecutions, makes independent prosecutorial decisions in accordance with the law, free from any interference. Prosecutions would be instituted by the Department of Justice only if there is sufficient admissible evidence to support a reasonable prospect of conviction, and if it is in the public interest to do so.""

""The Judiciary of the HKSAR exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled by the prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR in a fair and timely manner in strict compliance with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, with the procedural rights of defendants exercised in accordance with the law fully respected throughout the process. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws, and cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

Safeguarding Rights and Freedoms

The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. The HKNSL and the SNSO also clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for the protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc. Indeed, Article 19 of the ICCPR specifically requires that journalists must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities' including protection of national security or public order.

""In fact, since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. However, the so-called '2025 Annual Report' deliberately fabricated facts about freedom of the press and speech in Hong Kong. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, has an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The court further cited precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding press freedom in the reasons for verdict of a relevant case, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom. The US Government does not hesitate to take action against misleading and biased news reporting. Recently, it has set up a webpage to list such misleading and biased reporting of the media, and even described some of such media reports as 'subversive'. The US CECC's smearing of the HKSAR with double-standard is purely a shameful political maneuver.""

As for the so-called annual report's claim that women in Hong Kong faced discrimination and harassment in the workplace, this is an absurd accusation. The Sex Discrimination Ordinance protects women from discrimination, sexual harassment, and victimization in the prescribed area of employment.""

Maintaining long-term prosperity and stability

  Under ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong has the distinctive advantage of enjoying strong support of the motherland while being closely connected to the world. With such unparalleled connectivity, Hong Kong will continue to play its dual role as ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"". Hong Kong will also continue to leverage its strengths to enhance its role as international financial, maritime and trade centres, among others, whilst proactively integrating into the overall development of our nation, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, etc.. The HKSAR Government will continue to identify new areas for economic development and proactively compete for enterprises and talents with a view to promoting the sustainable development and enhancing the competitiveness of Hong Kong. As a matter of fact, Hong Kong has once again been ranked as the world's freest economy by the Fraser Institute. On the other hand, the US enjoys significant economic benefits in Hong Kong and has realised a trade surplus of more than US$270 billion with Hong Kong over the past 10 years, the largest among US global trading partners. There are about 1 390 US companies with their businesses in Hong Kong. All these demonstrate the close and long-standing economic ties between Hong Kong and the US, as well as the vast business interests of the US in Hong Kong. A stable and prosperous Hong Kong is certainly of mutual benefits to Hong Kong and the US."
特區政府強烈不滿和反對美國「國會及行政當局中國委員會」報告,2025-12-11 23:55,2025-12-12 00:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100937.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十二月十一日）就美國「國會及行政當局中國委員會」發表的所謂「二零二五年報告」，針對香港特區各方面情況的失實言論和污衊抹黑，表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府強烈不滿和反對美國『國會及行政當局中國委員會』重施故技，通過所謂年度報告干涉香港特區事務，肆意詆毀『一國兩制』成功實踐下的香港。美方一再以政治凌駕法治，歪曲事實、顛倒是非，妄圖干預香港依法施政、破壞香港繁榮穩定，注定以失敗告終。」

發言人重申：「特區政府堅決維護國家主權、安全和發展利益，全面準確貫徹『一國兩制』方針的最高原則。特區政府堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及香港特區其他維護國家安全的相關法律，依法有效防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，同時依法保障香港市民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈要求美方立即停止不符合國際法和國際關係基本準則的行為，立即停止干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」

就美方所謂報告對香港特區的詆毀，特區政府嚴正駁斥如下。

維護國家安全

特區政府發言人說：「特區政府強烈反對美方所謂報告針對香港特區維護國家安全相關法律的無稽失實內容。根據《聯合國憲章》為基礎的國際法及國際關係，維護國家安全是所有主權國家的固有權利，眾多實行普通法的司法管轄區，包括美國、英國、澳洲、加拿大等，都制定了多部維護國家安全的法律及執行措施，以保障所在地的國家安全。」

「正如特區政府多次強調，香港特區維護國家安全相關法律正是要令國家主權、統一和領土完整得以維護；『一國兩制』、『港人治港』、高度自治的方針得以全面準確貫徹；以及更好地保障香港居民和在香港的其他人的基本權利和自由。」

「《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》下的危害國家安全罪行的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區（包括美國、英國、澳洲、加拿大和歐盟成員國等在內的眾多國家）一致。警方有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌干犯危害國家安全罪行的人。」

「至於煽動意圖的相關罪行方面，香港特區法庭於不同案件中均已確認有關煽動的條文符合《基本法》和《香港人權法案》中有關保障人權的條文，亦確認在維護國家安全和保障言論自由之間已取得相稱而合理的平衡。有關罪行絕非要壓制僅屬根據客觀事實而對政府作出正當批評的言論。」

「美方所謂報告就黎智英的羈管安排更是毫無根據。特區政府亦已多次公開聲明，黎智英在羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務是完備的。懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括及時的醫療支援。在早前的公開法庭聆訊中，代表黎智英的資深大律師亦向法庭清楚表明，懲教院所為黎智英每日安排醫療檢查，且對黎智英在懲教院所內獲得的醫療服務沒有任何投訴，法官表示懲教署值得稱讚。至於黎智英與其他囚犯中止交往的安排（即所謂的『單獨監禁』），一直是根據黎智英本人的意願，並由懲教署經考慮所有相關因素後依法安排的。」

維護司法公正和法治精神

特區政府強調所有司法案件均是嚴格根據證據和依照法律處理。所有被告均嚴格按照香港適用法律（包括《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》），並在《基本法》及《香港人權法案》的保障下接受公平審訊。所謂『報告』中特別提及到黎智英所涉的危害國家安全犯罪案件，肆意就有關案件的辦理抹黑香港特區的執法、檢控和司法機關，其目的昭然若揭，就是企圖利用政治力量干預香港特區司法程序，以促使任何被告人不能獲得應有公平審訊。特區政府對這些妄圖破壞香港特區法治的行為，予以強烈譴責。

發言人續指出：「律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，依法獨立作出檢控決定，不受任何干涉，律政司在有充分證據令案件有合理機會達致定罪，以及在合乎公眾利益的情況下，才會提出起訴。」

「香港特區司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。檢控機關和司法機關嚴格履行《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的責任，確保所有危害國家安全犯罪案件得到公正、及時辦理，過程中充分尊重被告人依法行使各項程序權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案，案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。控方亦有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

保障權利和自由

發言人表示：「特區政府堅定維護香港市民受到法律保障的權利和自由。自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》亦清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港，有關言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會、遊行、示威的權利和自由。然而，和世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由。《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條更清楚指出，新聞從業員必須遵守及執行『特別責任和義務』，包括保障國家安全或公共秩序。

「事實上，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，本港的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。惟所謂『二零二五年報告』卻刻意捏造有關香港新聞和言論自由被壓制的指控。與世界其他地方一樣，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。法庭在相關案件的裁決理由也引用了歐洲人權法院關於新聞自由的判例，指出即使是報道涉及備受公眾關注的重要議題，在《歐洲人權公約》下也不享有完全不受限制的言論自由；最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障。美國政府對誤導和偏頗的新聞報道也不會坐視不理，最近更設立網頁羅列相關媒體的誤導和偏頗報道，甚至形容當中某些媒體報道屬『顛覆』，美方『國會及行政當局中國委員會』以雙重標準抹黑香港特區，純屬可恥的政治操作。」

至於所謂年度報告中指香港女性在職場中遭遇歧視與騷擾更是荒謬的指控。《性別歧視條例》保障婦女在僱傭範疇免受歧視、性騷擾及使人受害。」

保持長期繁榮穩定

在『一國兩制』下，香港擁有『背靠祖國、聯通世界』此得天獨厚的顯著優勢，並會藉此繼續發揮其作為『超級連繫人』和『超級增值人』的雙角色。香港亦會繼續發揮其優勢以鞏固國際金融、航運和貿易中心等地位，以及積極融入國家發展大局包括參與粵港澳大灣區建設、『一帶一路』高質量發展等。特區政府會繼續發掘經濟發展新領域，及更積極進取地招商引才，以促進香港的持續發展及提升其競爭力。事實上，香港繼續獲菲沙研究所評定為全球最自由經濟體。另一方面，美國在港享有重大的經濟利益，美國對香港的貿易順差過去10年超過2 700億美元，是其全球貿易夥伴中最高，並有約1 390家美國公司在港設有業務。這些數字顯示香港跟美國兩地有密切而長遠的經濟往來，而美國企業在香港擁有龐大的商業利益。香港的繁榮穩定必定對香港與美國互惠互利。"
Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-11 23:12,2025-12-11 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100912.htm,"  The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.2 billion as of noon today (December 11). In addition to the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.5 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government earlier announced that a living allowance from the Support Fund will be provided to each affected household, and the amount has been increased from $50,000 to $100,000. As of today, 1 784 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 121 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

 The Advisory Committee on Mental Health also announced today the launch of a one-year Compassionate Support Programme for Bereaved Families with the participation of a number of non-governmental organisations. Dovetailing with the ""one social worker per household"" service of the SWD, the programme provides free mental health support services, including grief and bereavement counselling for the bereaved, and refers them to clinical psychologists and/or psychiatrists for follow-up services as required based on mental health risk assessments, with a view to accompanying them through the pain of loss.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

 As of this morning, a total of 1 457 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 2 796 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or units from the Hong Kong Housing Society. The temporary shelter at Tung Cheong Street Community Hall has stopped admitting new users and will remain in operation until the existing users have relocated to arranged emergency accommodations.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

 The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 700 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, about 19 500 pieces of donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Judiciary support
---------------------

 The Legal Aid Department (LAD) has established a dedicated task force and will implement a series of support measures to assist residents and other affected persons in applying for legal aid in accordance with the statutory requirements to handle litigation and related matters about personal injury claims, property damage claims, employees' compensation claims, etc. Taking into account the burden and needs of residents and other affected persons, the LAD will arrange suitable legal representatives to handle their litigations upon approval of their legal aid applications, and will maintain communication with the residents and other affected persons throughout the process to ensure their rights and interests are fully safeguarded. In this regard, the LAD reminds residents and other affected persons intending to apply for legal aid not to arrange their own legal representation, or give instructions or sign authorisation documents for legal services, to avoid incurring unnecessary costs and safeguard their own interests.

 The Judiciary has taken forward a series of facilitative measures so that all potential legal proceedings related to the incident will be handled with priority and expeditiously. These measures include setting up a dedicated task group to ensure the swift and priority handling of legal proceedings related to the incident at all court levels, designating a team to handle probate-related matters concerning the deceased victims, waiving probate-related fees, and expediting the processing of coroner-related matters with priority.

Regulation and inspection work
----------------------------------

 While the scaffolding at the four Home Ownership Scheme courts, namely Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, On Kay Court in Kwun Tong, Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin and Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, as well as Fung Wah Estate in Chai Wan under the Tenants Purchase Scheme, has all been removed, the Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau still conducts regular inspections to monitor the conditions of the scaffolding. The contractors have been required not to place any miscellaneous items on the scaffolding to ensure the safety of residents.

 The Development Bureau today announced a new mechanism for scaffold nets on external walls to be sampled on-site, so as to ensure that scaffold nets used at construction sites comply with recognised standards. In addition to scaffold nets used in repair projects, the new mechanism also applies to those used in new building works.

 The new mechanism comprises three components: (1) contractors must provide certificates and test reports for the fire-retardant performance of the scaffold nets; (2) upon delivery of the scaffold nets to Hong Kong, contractors are required to take a specified number of samples in a specified manner, and send them to designated laboratories for testing. Samples must all pass the test before the scaffold nets can be installed; (3) the enforcement departments of the Government will conduct random verification checks after the scaffold nets are installed. The Buildings Department (BD) will allow flexibility for new buildings which are yet to be occupied or in use, considering the relatively lower level of risk. Contractors may first install the scaffold nets before conducting sampling and testing, so as to avoid affecting work progress.

 Taking into account the space constraints of some repair sites or construction sites of new buildings, the BD will allow on-site or off-site sampling. Contractors are required to establish a tracking system to the satisfaction of the BD so as to ensure that the installed scaffold nets are from the same batches that have passed laboratory testing.

 To facilitate the implementation of the new mechanism, the Government is identifying additional designated laboratories and aims to have a preliminary list drawn up next week. The Government has initially identified a suitable site for the industry to conduct off-site sampling, which is expected to be ready for use next week.

 To effectively address the short-term surge in demand for scaffold nets and testing services, the Construction Industry Council (CIC) will make special arrangements for collective bulk procurement and coordinated testing services. Contractors who have recently removed scaffold nets may use this service and take the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the operational procedures under the new mechanism. The CIC will also provide appropriate support to contractors facing cash flow pressure to facilitate their reinstallation of scaffold nets. In addition, the CIC has expanded the quota of the Multi-skilled/Skill Enhancement courses, which are tuition-free and with subsidies, to mitigate the impact of work suspension on workers. The Government and the CIC will work towards having the first batch of scaffold nets reinstalled in about one month after procurement and testing.

The Labour Department (LD) continues to inspect fire protection facilities and the fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding to ensure the occupational safety of workers. As of 4pm today, the LD has inspected 440 construction sites, issued a total of 226 written warnings and 105 improvement notices, and taken out 25 prosecutions."
Remarks by SDEV at media session on arrangements requiring scaffold nets for external walls to be sampled on-site and tested (with video),2025-12-11 22:45,2025-12-11 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100688.htm,"  Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, at a media session today (December 11) on arrangements requiring scaffold nets for external walls to be sampled on-site and tested:

Reporter: How many government laboratories are doing the testing now? What are their daily testing capacities at the moment? How often will the authorities conduct ad-hoc sampling after the scaffolding measures passed the test? And importantly, is the new system legally binding? What are the consequences for non-compliance? Finally, how exactly will the CIC assist the industry financially? As you just mentioned they need to bear the additional costs at the moment, are they financially viable?

Secretary for Development: Perhaps I will invite Mr Cheng (the Executive Director of the Construction Industry Council, Mr Albert Cheng) to take your third question first.

Regarding your first question about the number of laboratories currently doing the testing and in future. Currently, my understanding is that not many laboratories offer this service because there is no market since we are only introducing this new system requiring the products to be tested after their arrival in Hong Kong. Because previously, normally the suppliers, they will receive the certificate showing the testing results in the area of origin, so no testing is required within Hong Kong. But after our new system is out, we believe this service will be in demand, so we are right now contacting a number of laboratories. Let them know our new requirements and see if they can gear up their facilities and manpower to provide this service.

Your second question is about the legal liabilities. Yes, it is legally binding because what we have described just now, the procedures and the requirements, the specimens required and the way of collecting the specimens, will be specified in a practice note to be promulgated by the Buildings Department for the sector. And according to the Buildings Ordinance, if any contractor does not comply with the requirement regarding the testing and also putting up the scaffolding nets, for example, they put up scaffolding nets without going through this on-site sampling and testing, that will be a violation of the requirement and the immediate result is the ceasing of works. The Buildings Authority will then issue an order to cease works immediately and also there will be other sanctions under the law.

發展局局長就外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查安排會見傳媒答問內容（附短片）,2025-12-11 22:33,2025-12-11 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100805.htm,"​發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十二月十一日）下午聯同屋宇署署長何鎮雄及業界代表就外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查安排會見傳媒。以下是甯漢豪的答問內容：

記者：首先想問剛才說棚網最快一個月後才可以陸續上架，其實那時已一月中或一月下旬，二月中就已經是新年，是否所有工程最快在農曆年後才可以正式完全復工？在這段時間，對於所有分判商或者承辦商，其資金流或者停工會損失多少，影響有多大？其次就是，今日除棚網外，其實林哲玄醫生亦有因應瑪嘉烈醫院的檢測證書造假，批評整個建造業界「爛到不能再爛」，他覺得所有事情都要重新改革，你自己怎樣看他這個言論，以及建造業還有哪些方面要做？第三，想問建造業議會這次只是就棚網做追蹤系統去趕做證書，但其實可能有更多建造業物料或者任何檢測都需要做，為何這次只做棚網，還是政府應該承擔起責任，所有物料都做追蹤，不要「頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳」？

發展局局長：你有四個問題。首先，我們剛才說在這個眼前的時期，因為有大量、起碼有二百多，甚至之前有些已自行下網，加起來可能有400宗維修項目，現時已停工，大家都等待我們這個新制度出台，再去買些新棚網，然後上架。當然，我不排除有個別承建商，其已下架的網，他覺得有信心可以通過我們這個制度，不排除他可以將已下架的網進行我們這個採樣和測試，因為我們現在已經宣布，他可以引用，但我們相信大部分都會先選擇用建造業議會這個集體採購，因為是集體採購，我相信已讓時間加快。我們現時希望能夠來貨，都是兩個星期左右的時間有第一批貨可以來到。剛才我說檢測時間，希望採樣後去檢測不要多於一個星期，又預留一些緩衝，所以我們為何說大約一個月左右，希望有第一批工程可以將網上架。剛才你說是否代表有一些工程要在農曆年後，因為現時說的是數以百計維修項目，大家每一個進程都不同，有些可能根本已經接近尾聲，有些剛剛開始，所以我們很難一概而論。但我們與業界的心意都一樣，希望在採用一個新制度下，讓市民安心、安全地進行這些維修工程。

另外你提到有否估計承建商資金流和現金流的損失，我們自己初步看，你何時進行工序都要買網，但今次因為中途要大家下網又上架，如果以一幢單幢樓宇，二十多三十層計，可能都涉及幾十萬費用。先前我提過，因為這些工程本身，我們要求承建商負上責任，所以大體上應該由承建商肩負起額外成本，因為這是一個特別階段，除非他和業主的合約另有訂明。但我們亦得到建造業議會協助，在合適情況下，為承建商協助其現金流，我想這些都是大家要共同面對的問題。

第三個問題，你提到林哲玄議員，他今日評論說建造業很差，但我相信如果以文件造假這類個案，嚴格來說，各行各業都曾有發生。當然今次大廈維修的火災事件，亦看到我們在不同制度上有需要改善的地方，但我絕對不同意這是我們建造業差勁，因為其實建造業在這麼多年來說，無論我們的基建、建造質素，我們的業界其實在區域甚至在國際上都有良好聲譽。但很不幸，今次我們看到業內的確有個別人士不守規矩，這些我會稱他為害群之馬，不要因為害群之馬「一竹篙打一船人」，我們看到整個建造業都是很團結，想將自己的工作做好，不要妄自菲薄，我們要針對問題去處理問題。

最後你提到我們今次有一個棚網檢測採樣的制度，可否引用在其他地盤用的物料和產品。我想大家都可以想像得到，一個建築地盤，無論是起新樓也好，做基建也好，做大廈維修也好，進入地盤的工料產品多元多樣，如果我們每一個產品都要做我剛才說的採樣和檢測，似乎不切實際，我也不相信世界上有其他先進城市這樣做。但我們以風險為本，譬如類似的制度，我們現時在採購一些鋼筋、混凝土和渠管都有這些制度。剛才我說的制度是否需要在我們更多的產品或工序使用呢，以風險為本的方向去檢視，我們是願意的，不過不可能是全部，因為這不切實際。但即使這樣，我也重申，在我們每一項建造工程，承建商和專業人士有他們的責任要負，政府也有我們的責任要負，訂立規矩、巡查，以及有違規，我們去跟進、檢控和懲處。我相信大家合力之下，都是用一個務實穩妥的方法去做。

記者：其實這段日子不少傳媒都發現網上有賣棚網假證書，之前警方都發現有些懷疑假證書，可否講一講建造業議會的集中採購，因為始終可能涉及很多工程，在採購時會如何確保供應商可靠？亦想了解集中採購服務會維持多久？預期成本與之前有何分別？剛才局長提到，棚網會隨時間減弱阻燃效能，雖然其後會做隨機覆檢，其實覆檢預期多久會做一次，才能確保在這麼多工程中，在整個以年計的工程時間中，都不會出現因時間而減弱阻燃效能，而有機會造成風險？

發展局局長：或者我回應你第三個問題，接著請建造業議會鄭先生回應你首兩個問題。就第三個問題，我們都知道棚網隨着時間，或者日曬雨淋、打完風，可能都會有破損，都會影響其功能，所以這次在新制度下，屋宇署署長會要求大家即使棚網已上架，經過我們的採樣檢測上架後，一年後如果仍在用同一個棚網，要重新再做抽樣檢測，雖然已經上架也可以再採樣，這是一個要求。

記者：政府部門以往巡查時有沒有檢查棚網，流程為何，由誰檢查？會否覆核報告和自行送檢？第二條問題，目前有些棚網已送去檢測，當中有幾多成合規和不合規，報告多少是真、多少是假？最後一條問題，在統一採購方面如何確保現時內地有足夠貨源，內地工廠的生產能力是否足夠，以往有沒有與內地廠家直接溝通？

發展局局長：就你的第一條問題，我們過去如何進行巡查。我記得上星期在這裏和大家見面時都提到，過去的制度是由屋宇署訂立棚網阻燃標準，然後期望承建商和業界去跟從這個標準。如果有人沒跟從，而發現他導致或有可能導致危害，署方便會跟進，按條例懲處。你可以說過去這個制度，我們比較着重事後追究，但現時看到既然業界有一些害群之馬鑽空子，那我們便要做好一個事前防備，所以今日便有這個新制度。

另外你剛才提到，之前棚網未下架時，屋宇署作為一個跟進的特別巡查，在約400幢樓宇都採取了棚網樣本，我亦曾經提過，在上、中、下不同的地方、樓層都有採樣，所以是數以千計的樣本，因此現時還未有最終的結果。當有結果時，這個新制度已經開始運行，但之後如果有些結果不合格，即代表從前曾經有些個案將不符規的棚網上架使用，屋宇署會保留其權利，因應這個檢測結果，根據《建築物條例》作跟進懲處。如果我們懷疑有人行使假文書，亦會轉介警方，因為他們已經設立一個專組進行這類調查。

記者：你剛才提到建造業有害群之馬，從剪鋼筋、天秤倒塌，到這次宏福苑事件等，如果說這些都是個別害群之馬造成，會否其實有太多害群之馬，政府有沒有方法去解決這個問題？還有棚網的新制度，現時是現場隨機採樣，以宏福苑為例，之前政府部門都有進行採樣，那新制度與以往的做法有何分別？另外有指政府近來曾接觸市建局討論重建，會否考慮原址重建，還是清拆舊樓後發展新項目，發展局有否找到心儀用地？

發展局局長：你有三個問題。第一個，業界有害群之馬，這個我們不能否認。我們除了懲處那些害群之馬，當然也要反思自己的制度有沒有一些地方有空子，讓這些害群之馬找到縫隙，所以行政長官也說得很清楚，他即將成立的獨立委員會除了會檢視事件，也會檢視我們的制度。我們自己和署方也會按現時執行的制度指引，啓動我們的一些檢視，所以無論是制度和責任的追究，其實政府都會跟進。

你第二點提到，之前我們大火後都有做採樣，那是為了進行跟進調查而做的採樣。那些其實已經是一些現樓，有些棚網已經掛了上去，所以無論是屋宇署也好，或者房屋局的獨立審查組也好，大家安排一些棚工爬上現樓採樣，或者在火災現場採樣。剛才我們提到的這個制度，是日後所有來貨都要按批次，並按剛才署長提過的、引用ISO國際認可的採樣制度去抽取足夠數目的樣本，而且具隨機性，因此是一個制度化的採樣制度，不只是為了我們跟進調查而做，所以在這裏會有一些不同，是更加制度化。

而你第三個問題是關於我們為災民安排的一些重建選項。這個現時在政府裏面有一個專組，財政司副司長領導的專組正在審視，我相信適當時候政府會再有交代。

記者：會否覺得害群之馬和制度漏洞都比較多？

發展局局長：我不會說數量，但我們承認無論是我們的制度、個別的執行，以及業界自己都有需要改善的地方。

記者：首先想請教一下局長，其實政府會如何確保拿去檢測和實際使用的棚網是同一批次，以及實驗室的數目其實要多少？另外想請教一下，因為之前局長與業界見面，探討金屬棚取代竹棚，想問問現時進度是怎樣？

發展局局長：首先提到實驗室的數目要多少，其實我們的確希望越多越好，因為都是一個市場的選擇。如果我們有了這個檢測的要求，其實我們都希望市場能夠多一點提供這個檢測服務。為甚麼說越多越好，這樣價格就更有競爭性，還有就是效率，出的結果又可以越快。但是我們自己初步評估，如果我們想處理眼前數百宗正進行維修而有網下了架的個案，我們希望起碼找到五至六間，然後慢慢可以越來越多，所以我們不會說夠了，五至六間就不繼續找下去，都希望市場可以繼續發展這個檢測的服務。

記者：如何確保抽樣和實際使用的是同一批次？

發展局局長：建造業議會作為一個領頭羊，在第一批做集體採購服務時，會引入QR code二維碼的制度，有追蹤的功能。正正因為這樣，我們覺得由建造業議會牽頭，為眼前這批項目做示範作用，日後有這個追蹤制度，其他承建商在他們個別的工程，到時他們自己要做，就有一個依照了。

最後你提到關於竹棚和金屬棚的考慮，其實先前我都有和業界開會，主要我們提出，其實這個討論都進行了很多年，我絕對不是說，竹棚是這次事件的起因，因為大家要弄清楚，這次大埔火災的起因，可能有很多因素，現時調查還在進行中。但平情而論，竹棚和金屬棚兩者就這樣比較，平常人都會相信，金屬棚的耐燃程度應該高一些。另外對於工人來說，他們在金屬棚上行走，其實安全性都是高一些，比較少有不慎跌倒的情況。所以在這個大環境之下，我們就和業界商討，我們是否都應該可以為轉用金屬棚有一個路線圖，但大家都有一個共識，就是未必需要一刀切，因為香港有一些環境，如果街道很狹窄，或者有一些舊樓做維修，它未必能夠承托到金屬棚的力，所以我們必定要務實，都要按實際情況，但是大家的共識就是，如果能夠用金屬棚的場景，大家盡快有一個時間表，讓大家可以轉用金屬棚。

Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected cannabis buds and duty-not-paid cigarettes at airport (with photo),2025-12-11 22:16,2025-12-11 22:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100866.htm,"Hong Kong Customs yesterday (December 10) detected a drug trafficking case involving baggage concealment at Hong Kong International Airport and seized about 13.5 kilograms of suspected cannabis buds with an estimated market value of about $2.7 million. 163 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were also seized from the baggage.

A 34-year-old local male passenger arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, yesterday (December 10). During customs clearance, suspected cannabis buds, weighing about 13.5 kg in total, and 163 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarette were found inside his baggage. The male was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug, one count of possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and one count of failing to declare them to Customs officers. The case will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court tomorrow (December 12).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

​政府公布跟進大埔火災最新情況,2025-12-11 21:17,2025-12-11 21:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100796.htm,"政府就大埔宏福苑火災成立的三個工作組——調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組——正全力持續跟進火災的支援、善後及調查事宜，詳情如下：

經濟及福利援助
———————

截至今日（十二月十一日）中午，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」已收到的外界捐款約32億元，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為35億元，會用在協助居民重建家園，是長期和持續的支援。

政府早前宣布從基金向每戶受影響家庭發放生活津貼，金額已由五萬元增至十萬元，截至今日已處理1 784宗個案；另外，就每名死者向家屬發放20萬元慰問金及五萬元殮葬金，截至今日已處理121宗個案。政府會陸續發放有關款項。

社會福利署（社署）社工已接觸超過1 980個受影響住戶，為超過4 900名居民登記「一戶一社工」服務。社署會與受影響住戶保持聯繫，為他們提供一切所需協助，並全力支援政府的善後工作。

精神健康諮詢委員會今日亦宣布推出為期一年的「守望．同行」災後喪親家庭支援計劃，獲多間非政府機構參與，配合社署「一戶一社工」服務，免費為喪親者提供哀傷善別輔導等精神健康支援服務，並根據精神健康風險評估，在有需要時轉介喪親者接受臨床心理學家及／或精神科醫生跟進服務，陪伴他們走過傷痛。

住宿援助
————

截至今日上午，共有1 457名居民入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有2 796名居民現居於房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會項目的單位。位於東昌街社區會堂的臨時庇護中心已停止開放予新的使用者，只繼續運作至現有使用者遷往經安排的應急住宿為止。


物資援助／捐獻
———————

政府與資訊科技業界構建的物資捐獻網上平台繼續運作，團體及市民可於平台登記可捐贈的物資。政府至今共收到超過1 700個登記，其中約三成由機構提出，而餘下的由市民個人提出。已登記可捐獻物品種類涵蓋食品及飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具、電器等多個類別。政府正透過相關政策局、政府部門和服務團體掌握居民的實際需要後進行物資配對工作，以便陸續把適用物資派送往有需要的地點。至今已有約 19 500件涵蓋不同類別的物資配送至多個地點。物資配對和分發工作會持續進行。

司法支援
————

法律援助署（法援署）已成立特別專責組，並會推出一系列的支援措施全力協助居民及其他受影響人士按法例要求申請法律援助（法援），以處理人身傷亡索償、財產損失追討及僱員補償等訴訟及相關事宜。考慮到居民及其他受影響人士的負擔和需要，法援署會在他們獲批法援後，安排合適的法律代表處理訴訟，其間亦會與居民及其他受影響人士保持溝通，以確保他們的權益獲充分保障。就此，法援署提醒有意申請法援的居民及其他受影響人士無需自行張羅法律代表、作出法律指示或簽署法律委託文件，以免衍生不必要的費用，保障自身權益。

司法機構制定一系列便利措施優先和迅速處理與事故相關的所有擬開展的法律程序。措施包括成立專責工作小組，確保各級法院迅速和優先處理與事故相關的法律程序、由專責隊伍處理與事故罹難者相關的遺產承辦事宜、豁免遺產承辦事宜的相關費用，以及優先和加快處理與死因裁判相關的事宜。


規管巡查
————

雖然四個居屋屋苑（深水埗怡閣苑、觀塘安基苑、沙田穗禾苑、深水埗清麗苑）和一個租置屋邨（柴灣峰華邨）的棚架已經全部拆除，房屋局獨立審查組仍會定時巡查並監察棚架狀況，並要求承建商確保棚架不可存放雜物，以保障居民安全。

發展局今日公布外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查新制度，以確保工地使用的棚網符合認可標準。新制度除適用於維修項目使用的棚網，亦適用於新建樓宇工程的棚網。

新制度包括三個環節：（一）承建商必須提供棚網阻燃效能證明書和檢測文件；（二）在棚網抵港後，承建商須按政府要求，以指定方式抽取指定數目樣本，送到政府指定實驗所檢測。送交測試的樣本必須全部通過檢測，棚網才可上架使用；（三）棚網上架後，政府執管部門會隨機抽樣覆核。考慮到新建樓宇未必有人在內居住或使用，風險相對較低，屋宇署會提供彈性，承建商可選擇先把棚網上架再進行取樣測試，避免影響工程進度。

考慮到部分維修地盤或新建地盤空間有限，屋宇署容許實地取樣或場外取樣，而承建商須有可以令屋宇署信納的追蹤制度，確保最終上架的棚網是通過實驗所測試的批次。

為配合落實新制度，政府正物色更多指定實驗所，並於下星期擬定初步名單。政府已初步為業界找到合適用地進行場外取樣，預期下星期可供使用。

為有效處理短期內對棚網及檢測的大量需求，建造業議會（議會）會特事特辦，提供集體採購及統籌檢測服務，近日將棚網下架的承建商，可以選擇參加有關服務計劃，並從中學習新制度的操作流程。議會亦會以合適的方式，協助有現金流壓力的承建商完成重新安裝棚架。議會並已擴大「免學費、有津貼」「一專多能／技術提升」課程學額，減低停工對工友的影響。政府和議會會爭取首批棚網在約一個月時間經過採購及檢測後，陸續上架。

勞工處繼續巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，以保障工人的職業安全。截至今日下午四時，勞工處已巡查440個建築地盤，共發出226份書面警告及105張敦促改善通知書，並提出25宗檢控。"

Speech by SFST at 23rd Anniversary Gala Dinner of Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies (English only),2025-12-11 20:08,2025-12-11 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100454.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the 23rd Anniversary Gala Dinner of The Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies today (December 11):

K C (Chairperson of the Chamber, Professor K C Chan), Mike (Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber, Mr Wong Ming-wai), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my pleasure to join you tonight at the 23rd Anniversary Gala Dinner of the Chamber of Hong Kong Listed Companies.

 For more than two decades, the Chamber has played a pivotal role in strengthening Hong Kong's position as a leading international financial centre. By fostering collaboration between listed companies, regulators, and the Government, the Chamber has helped shape the development of our markets. Today, as global finance undergoes profound transformation - from shifting capital flows to rising demand for resilience, innovation, and connectivity - Hong Kong stands firmly at the heart of this change. Our city continues to demonstrate agility and strength.

Market vibrancy and resilience

 Hong Kong's capital markets are distinguished by their breadth, depth, and regional connectivity. With over 2 600 companies listed on the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited) spanning diverse industries, our market capitalisation reached HK$48 trillion by the end of November this year - a 41 per cent increase year-on-year. Average daily turnover in the first 11 months of this year exceeded HK$255 billion, almost double the figure from the same period last year.

 We have also reclaimed our position as the world's top initial public offering (IPO) venue. By November, IPO proceeds totalled HK$259 billion, a remarkable 228 per cent increase year-on-year. Ninety-three new companies have been listed this year, attracting strong interest from international institutional investors. The pipeline is equally promising, with over 300 companies preparing to list - the highest on record - and more than 40 per cent of them from the technology sector. Beyond IPOs, Hong Kong also ranks among the top three exchanges globally for follow-on issuance, raising over US$85 billion as of late November.

 This success is no accident. It reflects co-ordinated efforts by the Government, regulators, the HKEX, and industry peers to modernise our listing regime and attract high-quality issuers. Since 2018, reforms have made our platform more inclusive and competitive, welcoming new economy and technology enterprises. Streamlined pathways for overseas issuers, flexible disclosure standards and enhanced vetting timetables have further strengthened our appeal. The surge in activity this year is a testament to renewed investor confidence and the effectiveness of these reforms.

Advancing Renminbi (RMB) internationalisation

 Hong Kong is not only a hub for capital formation but also a strategic platform for RMB internationalisation. Leveraging our role as the world's leading offshore RMB centre, we have built a suite of mutual market access programmes - Stock Connect, Bond Connect, Swap Connect - that link international investors with Mainland markets. These programmes have become essential infrastructure for cross-border investment and risk management.

 Recent enhancements have expanded product scope, improved settlement efficiency, and deepened integration. In the first three quarters of 2025, Northbound Stock Connect trading averaged over RMB200 billion daily, while Southbound trading reached an average of over HK$120 billion. Notably, Southbound inflows surged to HK$1.17 trillion - already surpassing last year's total by nearly 45 per cent. Southbound trading now accounts for nearly a quarter of Hong Kong's market turnover, underscoring the strength of Mainland investor participation.

 Beyond equities, we are also determined to reinforce Hong Kong's role as a global fixed income and currency (FIC) hub - a cornerstone of the offshore RMB ecosystem. The Roadmap for the Development of FIC Markets, jointly announced by the Securities and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, sets out 10 initiatives across four pillars to guide policy and implementation. These measures aim to attract issuers, provide risk and liquidity management tools, boost offshore RMB usage, and develop next-generation infrastructure for innovation.

Reforming for growth and innovation

 Looking ahead, we are committed to sustaining momentum and unlocking new opportunities. A comprehensive review of the listing regime is underway, covering requirements for primary, secondary, and dual listings, as well as post-listing obligations. We are also broadening product offerings, fostering regional collaboration on exchange-traded fund (ETF) listings, and expanding the number of recognised exchanges to encourage two-way capital flows.

 At the same time, we are advancing initiatives to improve trading efficiency and strengthen risk management. Technical upgrades are supporting the transition to an uncertificated securities market, while further consultation will take place on adopting a T+1 settlement cycle for cash equities. Legislative work is also progressing to facilitate stamp duty payments in RMB, further promoting the currency's use in cross-border transactions.

 On mutual market access, new measures are being taken forward with a view to their early implementation, including offshore Mainland government bond futures, block trading of stocks, and the inclusion of RMB counters. These steps will deepen integration and reinforce Hong Kong's role as the gateway to Mainland opportunities.

Driving ESG awareness and strengthening sustainability disclosures

 Market development must go hand in hand with market quality and sustainability. Tonight's Gala Dinner highlights a theme central to our future: corporate governance and ESG (environmental, social and governance). These are the foundations of integrity and sustainable growth in our capital markets. The Chamber has long championed excellence in governance and ESG, encouraging issuers to embed these values in their culture. I extend my heartfelt gratitude for its leadership.

 We are committed to raising governance standards and creating an environment conducive to long-term capital inflows. Since 2022, the HKEX has implemented Core Shareholder Protection Standards and revised the Corporate Governance Code, strengthening practices in areas such as board independence, diversity, and shareholder communication. Following extensive consultation, new measures to enhance board effectiveness, independence, and risk management have been rolled out in phases since July this year, reflecting rising global investor expectations.

 Equally important are sustainability disclosures aligned with international standards. In January, The HKEX introduced new climate-related disclosure requirements, closely aligned with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) S2 standards. This positions Hong Kong among the first exchanges globally to adopt such measures, reinforcing our role as a sustainable finance centre and preparing issuers for eventual local sustainability reporting.

 Our sustainable finance ecosystem continues to grow. By September, Hong Kong hosted over 500 green, social, and sustainable bonds and 10 ESG-related ETFs. We are now the world's second-largest biotech fundraising hub and the largest EV (electric vehicles) fundraising ecosystem. The introduction of Chapter 18C has further facilitated listings by specialist technology companies, including green tech enterprises. Going forward, we will work closely with regulators and the HKEX to strengthen ESG frameworks and support corporates on their sustainability journey.

Closing

 Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude a busy and transformative year, I wish to thank the Chamber and its members for your invaluable contributions to the growth and quality of our markets. As we continue to enhance competitiveness, deepen connections with the Mainland, and strengthen ties with the global business community, I am confident that the Government can count on your partnership. Together, we will ensure Hong Kong remains not only efficient and innovative, but also inclusive, sustainable, and responsive to the aspirations of investors and enterprises across our country and region.

 Finally, let me congratulate the Chamber on its 23rd anniversary, and extend warm congratulations to the recipients of this year's Corporate Governance and ESG Excellence Awards.

 I wish you all a pleasant evening, and a healthy and prosperous year ahead. Thank you."
Launching ceremony of Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution held today (with photos/video),2025-12-11 20:07,2025-12-11 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100727.htm,"  The launching ceremony of the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution was held at Kai Tak Stadium today (December 11).

  The pilot scheme, launched by the Department of Justice (DoJ) and supported by the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB) as one of the initiatives under the Policy Address, aims to provide the sports sector with a fair, efficient and convenient mechanism for resolving sports disputes through mediation and arbitration, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of Hong Kong's sports industry and promoting Hong Kong as an international centre for sports dispute resolution.

  The Deputy Secretary for Justice and Chairperson of the Advisory Committee on Sports Dispute Resolution, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan; ââthe Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law; the Director-General of the Department of Law of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Liu Chunhua; the Commissioner for Sports, Mr George Tsoi; and Vice-President of the Sports Federation & Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China (SF&OC), Mr Kenneth Fok, attended the launching ceremony. Over 160 representatives from the sports and legal sectors, including the SF&OC, the Hong Kong Sports Institute, the Hong Kong Bar Association, the Law Society of Hong Kong and national sports associations, as well as some current and retired Hong Kong athletes, also joined the ceremony.

  Delivering a speech at the ceremony, Dr Cheung said that with the vibrant development of the sports industry, sports disputes are an inevitable result of interactions among stakeholders; therefore, establishing a dedicated mechanism for resolving sports disputes is an important foundation for advancing the sports industry to new heights.

  Dr Cheung stated that the DoJ has been working closely with the sports and legal sectors on the launch of the pilot scheme over the past two years. This scheme provides a fair, efficient, and convenient mechanism for resolving sports disputes through mediation and arbitration, promoting the development of the sports industry through free competition in a fair market. The DoJ will continue to collaborate with the legal and sports sectors to organise various promotional and training activities to further enhance public awareness of sports dispute resolution. He also encouraged professionals from different fields to actively participate in and make further contributions to the development of sports industry and dispute resolution services in Hong Kong.

  Miss Law in her speech said that the CSTB fully supports the DoJ as well as the legal and sports sectors in jointly promoting the Pilot Scheme on Sports Dispute Resolution, which establishes a neutral, fair, and efficient mechanism to effectively handle various sports-related disputes and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of athletes, coaches, sports organisations and all stakeholders. The pilot scheme not only addresses the current practical needs of the sector, but also contributes to creating a healthier and more sustainable development environment, laying a solid foundation for the long-term future of sports in Hong Kong.

  At the launching ceremony, Dr Cheung, on behalf of the DoJ, signed a memorandum of understanding with the representatives from the AALCO Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Centre (AALCO-HKRAC) and the eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre (eBRAM). The AALCO-HKRAC will administer the pilot scheme and provide institutional support for the conduct of mediation and arbitration, while eBRAM will provide the technological infrastructure and support required for the operation of the pilot scheme, with a view to promoting a wider use of lawtech and online dispute resolution services.

  In the subsequent panel discussions, speakers from the legal and sports sectors, as well as the DoJ, engaged in in-depth discussions on the advantages of mediation and arbitration in resolving sports disputes and introduced the features of the pilot scheme.

  To implement the pilot scheme, the DoJ established the Advisory Committee on Sports Dispute Resolution, comprising representatives from the CSTB, the Hong Kong Bar Association, and the Law Society of Hong Kong early this year. It also invited proposals from interested dispute resolution institutions and online dispute resolution institutions for the operation of the pilot scheme in June. The Advisory Committee then conducted a rigorous review of the proposals received based on a set of published assessment criteria. The AALCO-HKRAC and the eBRAM have been selected to serve respectively as the administering body and the technology provider of the pilot scheme.

  The pilot scheme will begin accepting case applications at the beginning of the first quarter of 2026, with an operational period of two years followed by a review. It will adopt a ""mediation first, arbitration next"" approach to resolve both commercial and non-commercial sports disputes. The pilot scheme features an online mediation and arbitration platform, as well as expedited procedures to enhance the efficiency of dispute resolution and address urgent disputes that may arise during competition. The Government will provide subsidy for eligible cases."
屋宇署署長就外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查安排會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-12-11 19:27,2025-12-11 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100676.htm,"發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十二月十一日）下午聯同屋宇署署長何鎮雄及業界代表就外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查安排會見傳媒。以下是何鎮雄的開場發言：

我現在介紹局長剛才所説的新制度的細節。先講解維修樓宇地盤：

第一步，註冊承建商必須就棚網向供應商取得阻燃效能證書及測試報告，以供業主及執法人員隨時檢查。

第二步，註冊承建商須在棚網運抵地盤後，就棚網的每個訂購批次，安排第三方隨機選取棚網，以讓承建商按政府指定的ISO標準以指定數量進行取樣，並送交指定實驗所進行測試，全程須以錄像紀錄。送交測試的樣本只要有一個不合格，整個批次須更換。只有所有測試樣本均合格，該批次才可上架。測試結果須通知屋宇署以作備存。

考慮到維修地盤或新建地盤部分空間有限，我們容許實地取樣或場外取樣。如果選擇場外取樣，我們需要確保最終上架的棚網是通過實驗所測試的批次。就過渡期而言，相信首批棚網大部分會透過建造業議會特別集體訂購供港，而議會會考慮使用科技系統，例如QR code二維碼，作出物流追蹤。短期內如果個別註冊承建商沒有採用建造業議會的服務，我們要求承建商要採用一個適當可以令屋宇署信納的追蹤制度。屋宇署亦會就場外取樣的個案加強抽查。

第三步，測試合格的棚網上架後，屋宇署會隨機選取項目進行實地抽查，要求註冊承建商在屋宇署人員在場見證下，即場抽取樣本送交認可實驗所測試。任何一個樣本不符合認可標準同樣需要整個範圍移除物料。

另外，由於棚網的阻燃效能會隨時間或受地盤的運作影響而減弱，註冊承建商須定期檢測棚網的阻燃效能，以確保棚網仍然符合認可標準。

上述流程同樣適用於新建樓宇地盤，唯一變奏在於，就新建樓宇地盤，我們提供彈性安排，容許註冊承建商可選擇先把棚網上架再進行取樣測試。這是因為業界向我們反映，地盤涉及的工序需逐層上架，因而分批購買棚網，希望爭取時間，避免影響工程進度。另外，這也考慮到新建地盤沒有人居住，對公眾影響面較少，有空間提供彈性。不過，如果樣本不符合標準則需要馬上下架。

新要求的適用範圍包括於現存樓宇進行大維修、改動及加建、以及新建及拆卸樓宇的工程項目，涉及個別單位維修工程的懸空式棚架，俗稱吊棚或飛棚，則不包括在內。有關要求亦適用於帆布等鋪設在棚架上的其他防護物料。

如察覺可能有違規情況的個案，例如承建商沒有按屋宇署的要求進行抽樣測試，或屋宇署在實地抽查發現棚網樣本未達阻燃要求等，我們會考慮按《建築物條例》作出法律懲處。

我們稍後會按今天講解的流程向註冊承建商發出新的作業備考，並會於下星期約見業界團體，向他們詳細解釋新的安排。

我在此的簡介完畢。"
​發展局局長就外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查安排會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-12-11 19:26,2025-12-11 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100678.htm,"發展局局長甯漢豪今日（十二月十一日）下午聯同屋宇署署長何鎮雄及業界代表就外牆棚網就地抽樣檢查安排會見傳媒。以下是甯漢豪的開場發言：

各位傳媒朋友、各位市民，今日我希望交代外牆棚網的就地抽樣檢查安排。

現時，屋宇署就建築工程的棚網有明確的阻燃效能要求，必須符合認可的國際標準。大埔火災揭示有人使用不符合認可標準的棚網，亦有其他個案懷疑有人使用虛假文書，所以為了保障公眾安全及免除業主和住戶的疑慮，我在上星期三（十二月三日）宣布所有正進行維修的樓宇，如果外牆設有棚網，需要在上星期六（十二月六日）或之前將棚網下架，並停止外牆工程。

屋宇署發出命令後，230幢私人樓宇的外牆棚網已經完成移除。另外，房屋局獨立審查組指示下，約20個居屋及其他公營房屋維修項目的棚網亦已卸下。建築署亦已完成移除轄下兩幢政府建築物維修工程的棚網。

過去一星期，發展局與屋宇署密鑼緊鼓擬定外牆棚網抽樣檢查的新制度，並與業界溝通，我們的目標是希望確保在工地使用的棚網符合我們認可的標準。細節我會留待屋宇署署長向大家介紹。概括而言，新制度有三個主要環節：

（一）日後承建商必須提供棚網阻燃效能證明書和檢測文件，是必須要提供；

（二）來貨抵達香港後，必須按政府要求，以指定方式抽取指定數目樣本送到政府指定實驗所檢測，通過檢測後才可上架使用；

（三）上架後政府執管部門會隨機抽樣覆核。

這個新制度除了適用於維修項目使用的棚網，亦適用於新建樓宇工程的棚網，即是說如果我們興建一些新樓宇，有棚架，亦有用棚網，這個就地採樣和檢測制度都是適用，但考慮到新建樓宇未有人在內居住或使用，風險相對較低，所以我們會提供適當彈性，稍後署長會和大家講解是甚麼彈性。

新制度既要保障公眾安全，同時亦要從務實角度考慮，例如業界地盤的實際操作、建築工程周期、對大廈維修工程的影響等，我們希望這個制度能落到實處，讓業界知所跟從。

施行我剛才提及的這套新制度，政府要做好以下配套：

（一）要有足夠數量的指定檢測中心，希望檢測能有效率進行。我們的目標是當採樣樣本送到這些檢測中心，在一個星期內就可以有檢測結果。我們現時正在物色更多的檢測中心，目標在下星期有初步名單，也會逐漸增多；

（二）考慮到有些進行大廈維修的工地沒有太多空間放置棚網來貨，因為大家可以想像，在一些現有樓宇進行維修，地盤面積有限，不會有太多空地，所以在這些情況下，有部分採樣和儲存程序要在場外進行，所以我們已初步為業界找到合適政府用地，希望下星期投入運作，可以容許業界進行場外採樣工作。

接着我想和大家交代一個短期適用的特別安排。由於近期有大量棚網下架，而這些都是進行中的維修工程，所以我們相信短期內對棚網及檢測的需求會很大，突然間在同一個時期出現。而另一方面業界和承建商在新制度下亦需要時間學習和適應，加上這些項目一日未完成檢測，都要暫時停止外牆工程，對建造業界工人和承建商亦有一定影響，因此在這個短暫的過渡期，我們邀請了建造業議會在不同方面提供協助，得到議會積極回應，主要協助在這個過渡期已經採用我剛才提及的新制度，不過有一些特別服務，有以下三方面：

（一）建造業議會會提供集體採購及統籌檢測服務，特事特辦，如果近日因為屋宇署命令而要將棚網下架，或早前有些承建商自行將棚網下架，他們可以選擇參加建造業議會提供的集體採購及檢測服務計劃，希望有統籌，加快時序。而在這個過程，如果承建商參加的話，都希望他們藉此機會學習新制度下如何去採樣，由建造業議會牽頭，他們去學習、去適應；

（二）我們得到建造業議會的協助，在這個過渡期擴大「免學費、有津貼」的「一專多能／技術提升」課程學額，預留5 000個培訓名額予受影響工友報讀，既幫助他們提升技能，亦減低停工對他們的影響。按不同工種的培訓課程及時數，工友可獲最多14,000元至19,000元津貼不等；

（三）早前我提過下架又上架，其實對我們現正進行的工程，的確增加了成本。在這裏我也提過，因為屋宇署和執管部門的命令，是向承建商發出的，所以承建商有主體責任負責這些成本，除非他們和業主的合約另有規定。因此在這個時期，我們相信個別承建商可能會有現金流的壓力，建造業議會會考慮合適的方式，協助這些有財政困難的承建商完成他們的工序。

在這個過渡期，我們相信需要一些時間，因為我們得知很多棚網下架後，很多承建商寧願重新訂貨，所以我們會與建造業議會合作，爭取在一個月左右時間有首批棚網經過入口及檢測後，陸續可以上架。

我們明白業界需要時間適應新制度，正進行維修的業主也可能心急，但我希望大家明白，我們引入這個新制度是希望市民回復信心，也希望建造業能夠有一個好制度，在這個環節得以健康發展，所以我呼籲大家團結一致，齊心為公眾安全做好這件事。

我現在請屋宇署署長簡單介紹我剛才所說新制度下三個環節的運作情況。"

Speech by SCST at Swire Properties White Christmas Street Fair 2025 (English only),2025-12-11 18:52,2025-12-11 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100665.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the Swire Properties White Christmas Street Fair 2025 today (December 11):

Tim (Chief Executive of the Swire Properties, Mr Tim Blackburn), Tammy (Editor-in-Chief of the South China Morning Post, Ms Tammy Tam), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. First of all, a big thank you, Tim, for your invitation to me for this year's White Christmas Street Fair at Taikoo Place.

The White Christmas Street Fair 2024 was in fact one of the first few events that I attended after my appointment as the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism this time last year. I recalled it was a very nice event in which I talked to enthusiastic young presenters, tried different Christmas delicacies, and appreciated the heartwarming festive décor all through the Fair. It is still a fond memory.

So here I am attending this Fair again, this year with the added intention of sending the true Christmas message of Peace and Hope to all of you who are here today and to all Hong Kong fellow citizens, especially those who are braving the hardship brought by the Tai Po fire. I know that we will observe a moment of silence later on. Aside from paying tribute to the victims and sending silent regards to all affected, I hope that, if it is amenable to you, during the silence you could also pray for peace at heart and light of hope for everyone in Hong Kong.

Christmas is celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, who, according to the Bible, brought the hope of salvation to earth. Whether or not you are a Christian, Christmas is also a time to reconnect with what is truly important. This year's White Christmas Street Fair, which is a part of the Hong Kong Tourism Board's Hong Kong WinterFest, holds a special meaning for all of us. Now in its 13th year, it is much more than just a festive event. It embraces elements of the Christmas values, such as love, peace, hope and the importance of coming together as a community to share meaningful moments.

The theme of this year's fair, ""Colour the Season - Lights of Hope"", is timely. Inspired by Hong Kong's iconic neon lights, it brings us nostalgic feelings, allows us to relive childhood scenes, and reminds us that light in different colours and formats is all around us. As we gradually come out of the haze of the fire, the Fair gives us a very good opportunity to go back to a familiar atmosphere and to take our little ones, or bring bigger friends, to experience a moment of ease and comfort. So, I do encourage everyone here to spread the news of the Fair so that those who could use a drop of light at heart could come and join us.

I would like to say a big ""thank you"" to the Swire Properties for your generosity and dedication to supporting those in need. As Tim alluded to just now, on top of the corporate donations, the proceeds from on-site activities, along with a portion of sales at the retail and F&B (food and beverage) booths, will go to Operation Santa Claus to support a range of NGOs (non-governmental organisations). What's more, the Swire Properties will match every dollar raised with a dedicated contribution to the Tai Po relief effort. This thoughtful contribution truly embodies the spirit of Christmas - spreading love, hope and care to those in need, and making the Street Fair even more meaningful and special.

At the same time, the Hong Kong Tourism Board's Christmas Wonderland Central at Statue Square is another highlight of the Hong Kong WinterFest. There, a stunning 20-metre Christmas tree shines and a brand new Immersive Lights Show is on, every night throughout Christmas - another chance for us to take a moment to appreciate the beauty and creativity that surrounds us and to feel a sense of calm and joy.

My gratitude again to Swire for the invitation, and I am pleased to be a part of this meaningful evening. May I wish everyone a peaceful Christmas filled with love.

Thank you."
衞生署提醒市民不要前往青衣自然徑　減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險,2025-12-11 18:37,2025-12-11 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100629.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。本港今年累計錄得79宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。青衣自然徑目前已暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門近期會在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心再次忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。

因應近期有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，中心與食物環境衞生署（食環署）、民政事務總署、渠務署、地政總署和土木工程拓展署代表已舉行跨部門會議，敲定進一步在青衣自然徑一帶加強防控蚊患的措施。

DH advises public to avoid visiting Tsing Yi Nature Trails to reduce risk of contracting chikungunya fever,2025-12-11 18:37,2025-12-11 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100626.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 11), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 79 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported. The Tsing Yi Nature Trails is currently closed until further notice. The relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails. The CHP reiterated its appeal for the public to avoid entering the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

Regarding some local cases of CF who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the CHP has held an interdepartmental meeting with representatives from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), the Home Affairs Department, the Drainage Services Department (DSD), the Lands Department, and the Civil Engineering and Development Department, to further confirm measures to strengthen mosquito prevention and control in the vicinity of the Tsing Yi Nature Trails.

The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373). All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the FEHD has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could bring stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the DSD to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

  Furthermore, the FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


ââThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes and importing alternative smoking products (with photo),2025-12-11 18:23,2025-12-11 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100655.htm,"An incoming passenger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (December 11) for dealing with duty-not-paid cigarettes, failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and Import and Export Ordinance (IEO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming female passenger, aged 34, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (December 10). A total of 20 000 duty-not-paid cigarettes and 8 600 alternative smoking products, with an estimated market value of about $116,000 and a duty potential of about $66,000, were seized from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

The female passenger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 in contravention of the DCO and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment in contravention of the IEO today. The sentences will run concurrently.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002).  "

十二月份第一批涵蓋21個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

與上月（即二○二五年十一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這21個監察區中，20個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有一區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Among the first batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 21 survey areas in December, all were below 10 per cent.

Among these 21 survey areas, 20 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. November 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Another area recorded a slight increase, but the index was lower than 10 per cent.

The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

RGC holds inaugural Research Summit (with photos),2025-12-11 17:56,2025-12-11 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/11/P2025121100287.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the University Grants Committee:

The Research Grants Council (RGC) held its inaugural Research Summit, titled ""Forging Frontiers: Shaping the Future of Knowledge and Discovery"" today (December 11) at the Hong Kong Science Park. The Summit, supported by all eight University Grants Committee (UGC)-funded universities, was cohosted by the RGC and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The event, which was organised to highlight the research impacts and achievements of Hong Kong's higher education and to deepen international exchanges and co-operation, attracted the participation of more than 700 members of the local and international research communities.

Speaking at the opening session of the Summit, the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said that, ""Hong Kong is ready to grow into a strategic hub for innovation through more joint research initiatives and endeavours. We have a strong track record of outstanding and impactful research as demonstrated by the success of our universities' performance. The Government is committed to supporting the UGC and the RGC's efforts in nurturing our pool of emerging research talent and taking forward innovative research.""

Dr Choi emphasised that synergies arising from international and interdisciplinary collaborations are conducive to Hong Kong's development and benefit, not only for the city, but also for the nation and the world. ""We look forward to welcoming more outstanding students and young researchers to Hong Kong. Their fresh perspectives and enthusiasm will inject new energy into our academic community, fostering a vibrant environment where innovative and impactful research can flourish,"" she said.

The Chairman of the RGC, Professor Timothy W. Tong, highlighted that with the Government's continuous funding support and the robust research environment in local universities, the RGC has been actively fostering high-quality and impactful research, and working with the research community to advance knowledge discovery for the benefit of Hong Kong society.

  ""Research collaboration between the UGC-funded universities and overseas institutions has increased substantially from about 4 200 projects in 2014 to over 8 000 today, signifying that Hong Kong's higher education sector is one of the most internationalised in the world. We are a city that has chosen to invest in knowledge, innovation and scientific discovery, a premier place for carrying out international research collaboration and pursuing new areas of knowledge,"" said Professor Tong.

  With a programme designed to encourage forward-thinking dialogues, the RGC invited three prominent higher education leaders, and a number of distinguished researchers, representatives from research funding bodies and industry leaders locally, nationally and internationally.

  Former RGC Chairmen, who joined the occasion that also marked the 35th anniversary of the RGC, discussed how the Council can best support Hong Kong's research community in meeting challenges and seizing opportunities to elevate Hong Kong's role as an international hub for top talent, knowledge and innovation."
