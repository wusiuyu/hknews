The Independent Committee in relation to the fire has commenced work to examine the causes and circumstances that led to the fire and its rapid spread, construction safety and related issues concerning building maintenance and renovation works, as well as the systemic problems related to the tendering process of large-scale building maintenance and renovation works. The Government will proactively facilitate the investigation work.

 Moreover, the three task forces set up by the Government for the fire - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - have been following up on the relevant work. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
--------------------
ãã
 Different sectors of the Hong Kong community have participated in relief support and donations, contributing essential resources and morale for post-disaster reconstruction and social recovery. As of noon today (December 26), the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, has received about $3.8 billion in donations. Together with the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $4.1 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The fund launched 11 projects with a total commitment of about $1.2 billion, providing emergency financial support to various groups of people affected by the fire, including all residents, families of the deceased, hospitalised casualties, students, foreign domestic helpers, workers, flat owners, and tenants.

 The Government provides a $100,000 living allowance from the Support Fund to each affected household, while families of each deceased victim are provided with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. All verified cases have been processed so far. In addition, the Government earlier announced three new measures, providing flat owners at Wang Fuk Court with a grant of $100,000; an annual rental grant of $150,000 (to be provided for two years) and a one-off relocation grant of $50,000; as well as a one-off relocation grant of $50,000 for affected tenants. The allowances will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, and more than 4 900 residents have been registered for the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

Accommodation support
--------------------

 Currently, there is still a supply of more than 1 000 units that can provide affected residents with longer-term accommodation. The transitional housing and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects in different districts can altogether provide around 500 units at the moment. Moreover, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

 As of this morning, a total of 494 residents are staying in hotel rooms through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, and 549 residents are staying in youth hostels/camps. Another 3 591 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the HKHS, or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

 The Transport Department (TD) has been steering public transport operators (PTOs) to strengthen services of franchised buses, green minibuses, and residents' services by deploying additional vehicles and manpower to support residents affected who have been admitted into transitional housing in various districts, facilitating transfers to other services to and from different districts. The TD will closely co-ordinate with operating organisations of transitional housing projects concerned and PTOs to cater for residents' commuting needs.

Relief supplies and donations
--------------------

 The supplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 2 000 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, over 51 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Investigation and regulation
--------------------

 Relevant policy bureaux and departments continue to follow up on the fire investigation and regulatory efforts.

Follow-up work
--------------------

 Relevant policy bureaux and departments will continue to follow up on the support and relief work regarding the fire, including providing assistance in finance and welfare, accommodation and supplies, as well as medical, financial and legal support services for affected residents. Enforcement agencies and the Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force are making every effort to pursuethe investigation work related to the fire.

"Update on mosquito-borne diseases, dengue fever and chikungunya fever",2025-12-26 17:30,2025-12-26 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122600440.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (December 26) reported the latest situation of dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF). The Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, reminds the public that temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions (including neighbouring Southeast Asian countries) remain favourable for mosquito breeding. When travelling to areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, the public should take measures to prevent mosquito bites, including wearing loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved tops and trousers and applying insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or exposed parts of the body.

Dengue fever
----------------

  From December 19 to yesterday (December 25), the CHP recorded two imported DF case. The patient had travelled to the Philippines and Cambodia respectively during the incubation period.

  As of yesterday, 59 imported DF cases have been recorded so far this year. A total of 161 cases of DF were recorded in 2024, including 156 imported and five local cases.

  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. In 2024, the WHO recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. From January to July 2025, over four million cases and over 3 000 DF-related deaths have been reported in 97 countries/territories.

  DF is prevalent in many neighbouring tourist destinations. Indonesia, India and Vietnam have each recorded over 100 000 cases so far this year; Malaysia and Thailand have each recorded over 40 000 cases; and Singapore has also recorded over 3 500 cases.Meanwhile, according to the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Guangdong Province has recorded 3 579 locally infected cases so far this year. A total of 21 cases were recorded in a week between December 1 and 7, with the highest number of cases recorded in Shantou and Chaozhou.

  Detailed information on the latest DF situation in Hong Kong, as well as neighbouring and overseas countries and areas, has been uploaded to the CHP'swebsite.

Chikungunya fever
-----------------------

  As of 5pm today, no new cases of CF had been recorded. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported.

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

 The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding areas. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
  ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

衞生防護中心公布新增一宗類鼻疽個案,2025-12-26 17:15,2025-12-26 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122600454.htm,"​​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十二月二十六日）表示，過去一星期（十二月十九日至二十五日）錄得一宗新增類鼻疽個案。中心呼籲市民保持個人及環境衞生以預防類鼻疽，並特別提醒高風險群組，包括長者及長期病患者，在颱風或暴雨後應避免接觸土壤或泥水，減低感染風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的36歲男子。他居於東區，自十二月十三日起皮膚局部位置腫脹。他於十二月十七日到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院就自身長期病患就診，醫生發現其皮膚腫脹位置流出膿液，獲安排接受抗生素治療，目前情況穩定。病人的臨床診斷為皮膚膿腫，樣本經化驗證實對類鼻疽伯克氏菌呈陽性反應。

中心正調查個案的感染源頭，初步流行病學調查顯示，上述個案屬散發個案，沒有資料顯示與本港早前錄得的其他確診個案有流行病學關連。

截至昨日（十二月二十五日），本港今年錄得21宗類鼻疽個案。二○二四年共錄得23宗類鼻疽個案。

導致類鼻疽的病菌一般不會人傳人或經動物傳人，但可存活於本地環境。類鼻疽在香港屬風土病，本港每年亦有錄得類鼻疽個案。

根據文獻，類鼻疽個案於颱風或暴雨後較常出現。颱風或暴雨後，土壤和泥水中的類鼻疽伯克氏菌有機會曝露於地面，並隨着強風或暴雨令病菌更容易散播，從而令類鼻疽個案有機會增加。

就此，颱風和暴雨期間市民應盡量留在室內，避免前往可能出現水浸的地區，亦不應涉水或接觸泥水和泥土。同時，高風險人士應避免使用雨水渠道附近的道路，以免接觸可能由污水產生的氣溶膠。

市民亦應採取以下措施預防感染：

• 避免接觸受污染的土壤；
• 進行有機會接觸土壤或泥水的活動時，穿着適當的防護衣物，例如佩戴手套，並穿上水靴，高風險人士可考慮額外佩戴外科口罩；
• 接觸受污染的水或土壤後進行清洗或淋浴；
• 盡快清潔傷口，並以防水敷料覆蓋；
• 接觸土壤和進行園藝活動後，用肥皂和水洗手；
• 注意食物衞生，不要飲用未經煮沸的水；及
• 外遊人士可透過戶外水上活動受到感染。避免接觸可能受污染的水源（例如河流、池塘或湖泊）可減低受感染的風險。

中心呼籲市民，尤其是糖尿病患者或免疫力弱的人士，如出現病徵，應盡快求醫，以接受適切的醫學診斷和治療。就更多有關類鼻疽的資料，市民可參閱中心網站www.chp.gov.hk/tc/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html。"
CHP announces one new melioidosis case,2025-12-26 17:15,2025-12-26 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/26/P2025122600455.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (December 26) announced that one new melioidosis case was recorded in the past week (December 19 to 25). The CHP appealed to members of the public to maintain personal and environmental hygiene to prevent melioidosis. The CHP also specifically reminded high-risk groups, including the elderly and people with underlying diseases, to avoid contact with soil or muddy water after typhoons or storms with a view to lowering infection risk.

The case involves a 36-year-old male with underlying illnesses living in Eastern district. He presented with a localised skin swelling since December 13. He attended Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on December 17 for follow up of his underlying illnesses, during which pus discharge was found from his skin swelling. He was then admitted for antibiotics treatment, and is currently in stable condition. The clinical diagnosis was a skin abscess. His clinical sample was confirmed to be positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei upon testing.

  The CHP is investigating the infection source of the case. Initial epidemiological investigations revealed that the case is sporadic. No epidemiological linkages have been established between this case and other confirmed cases previously recorded in Hong Kong.

As of yesterday (December 25), 21 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year. In 2024, 23 melioidosis cases were recorded.

Person-to-person transmission and animal-to-human transmission are rare, but the bacteria causing melioidosis can survive in the local environment. Melioidosis is an endemic disease in Hong Kong, and melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year.

 According to literature, melioidosis cases are more common after typhoons or rainstorms. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and muddy water may become exposed to the ground after typhoons or rainstorms, and the bacteria could spread more easily with strong winds or rainstorms. As such, the number of melioidosis cases may increase.

 With this in mind, where practicable, members of the public should stay indoors during typhoons and rainstorms, avoid travelling to areas with potential flooding, and do not wade in or have contact with muddy water and soil. In addition, high-risk individuals should avoid paths near stormwater drains where aerosols may be generated from contaminated water.

 Members of the public should also take the following preventive measures against infection:


Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. using gloves and wearing boots. High-risk individuals may also consider wearing a surgical mask;
Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover them with waterproof dressings;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling soil or gardening;
Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
Travellers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimised by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

â
The CHP appealed to members of the public to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms, in particular people with diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions, in order to receive an appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment. For more information on melioidosis, please visit the website of the CHP atwww.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/101110.html."
