按照新簽訂的全面性協定，香港居民在約旦繳付的稅項均可根據《稅務條例》（第112章）抵免香港就同一筆收入所徵收的稅項，以避免雙重課稅。

此外，約旦向香港居民徵收股息、利息和特許權使用費的預扣稅稅率將由現時最高10%，降至不超過5%。

香港與約旦的全面性協定將在雙方完成有關批准程序後生效。就香港而言，行政長官會同行政會議會根據《稅務條例》就協定作出一項命令，該命令會以先訂立後審議程序提交立法會省覽。協定詳情載於稅務局網頁。

Hong Kong and Jordan enter into tax pact (with photos),2025-09-04 18:48,2025-09-04 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400605.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, had a bilateral meeting with the Ambassador of Jordan to China, Mr Hussam Al Husseini, in Beijing today (September 4) and signed on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government a comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreement (CDTA) with the Government of Jordan. Mr Hui said that the signing of the CDTA demonstrated Hong Kong's continuous efforts in deepening co-operation with Belt and Road countries, and is an excellent starting point to enhance the financial, economic and trade connections between Hong Kong and Jordan.

At the bilateral meeting, Mr Hui presented toMr Hussam Al Husseini the advantages and latest developments of Hong Kong's financial market, including the efforts made to promote the continuous vibrant development of the financial market and establish Hong Kong as an international gold trading centre.

Mr Hui said, ""Jordan is a participant in the Belt and Road Initiative. The CDTA signifies the determination of the HKSAR Government in expanding Hong Kong's CDTA network and its enhanced collaboration with tax jurisdictions participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.

""The CDTA sets out the allocation of taxing rights between Hong Kong and Jordan, which will help investors better assess their potential tax liabilities from cross-border economic activities. I have every confidence that it will be an excellent starting point to enhance the financial, economic and trade connections between the two places. This CDTA is the 53rd one that Hong Kong has concluded. We will continue to expand Hong Kong's CDTA network to enhance the city's attractiveness as a business and investment hub, and consolidate Hong Kong's status as an international economic and trade centre.""

In accordance with the newly signed CDTA, Hong Kong residents can avoid double taxation in that any tax paid in Jordan will be allowed as a credit against the tax payable in Hong Kong in respect of the same income, subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112).

Moreover, Jordan's withholding tax rates for Hong Kong residents on dividends, interest and royalties, currently at up to 10 per cent, will be capped at 5 per cent.

The Hong Kong-Jordan CDTA will come into force after completion of ratification procedures by both sides. In Hong Kong, the Chief Executive in Council will make an order under the Inland Revenue Ordinance, which will be tabled at the Legislative Council for negative vetting. Details of the CDTA are available on the Inland Revenue Department's website.

Mr Hui will return to Hong Kong this evening."
Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 to be gazetted tomorrow,2025-09-04 18:45,2025-09-04 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400692.htm,"The Government will gazette the Road Traffic (Amendment) (Ride-hailing Service) Bill 2025 tomorrow (September 5), with an aim of introducing a regulatory regime for ride-hailing services to safeguard the public's travel safety.

A spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said today (September 4), ""The current-term Government is determined to reform personalised point-to-point transport services. In addition to actively introducing various measures to enhance taxi services over the past few years, the Government proposes to introduce a clear legislative framework to regulate ride-hailing services, demonstrating our resolution to address the long-standing controversy.""

""In devising the regulatory framework, the Government has prioritised public safety and interests, and listened carefully to the views of various stakeholders with a view to achieving the objective of 'people-oriented and safe travel'. Our aim is to provide the public with more safe, legally compliant and diverse travel options, while ensuring the healthy and orderly development of the overall point-to-point transport service industry and creating a healthy competitive environment. This will help bring new vitality to the industry and achieve a win-win outcome for all parties. Moreover, the Government also proposes introducing new measures to combat illegal activities of carrying passengers for hire or reward,"" the spokesperson added.

Under the proposed regulatory regime, platforms, vehicles and drivers providing ride-hailing services must obtain appropriate licences/permits and meet the licence/permit conditions imposed by the Transport Department. The Government will set entry thresholds (including being a company registered in Hong Kong, operational experience, proof of financial capacity, capital investment, and directors' qualifications) for platforms applying for operation. Platforms must also maintain appropriate and efficient services and conduct due diligence on their vehicles and drivers. Regarding ride-hailing vehicles, the Government proposes that vehicles must be registered in the name of an individual and can only be operated by their registered owners. Also, ride-hailing vehicles must hold appropriate third-party risk insurance and display identification markings as required for identification purposes. For ride-hailing vehicle drivers, the Government proposes that applicants must meet a series of conditions and complete a specified test. These conditions include being at least 21 years of age, holding a Hong Kong permanent identity card, and having no serious traffic conviction records within the five years preceding the application date.

The spokesperson said, ""In July this year, the Government consulted the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport on the legislative proposals for the regulatory framework. Members unanimously supported the Government's proposal to regulate platforms, vehicles and drivers providing ride-hailing services. They also endorsed the Government's approach to first introduce amendments to the principal legislation into the LegCo to establish matters of principle and handle other technical details in the next stage through subsidiary legislation or licence/permit conditions, with a view to expediting the regulation of ride-hailing services and meeting public expectations.

""We would like to thank the LegCo Members for their support for the Government to take forward the legislative work on regulating ride-hailing services at full speed. We will actively co-operate with the LegCo in its scrutiny work and strive to have the Bill passed before the end of the current-term LegCo,"" the spokesperson added.

The Government will introduce the Bill into the LegCo on September 10 for first and second readings."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-04 18:22,2025-09-04 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400698.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 4), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  ""According to the World Health Organization, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July this year, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. Of these cases, about 90 were fatal. High temperatures and rainfall levels in summer continue to pose a risk of outbreaks of various mosquito-borne diseases in Hong Kong and around the world, and members of the public must remain vigilant. They must take proper mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and during travel. Individuals experiencing relevant symptoms should seek medical advice promptly and inform their doctors if they have a travel history,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The FEHD continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

To raise awareness among the elderly about preventing mosquito-borne diseases, the Visiting Health Teams under the Elderly Health Service of the DH have been advising them on mosquito-borne disease prevention and tips on travel health at health talks conducted at District Elderly Community Centres and Neighbourhood Elderly Centres. Moreover, the Visiting Health Teams have also reminded all residential care homes for the elderly in Hong Kong to enhance mosquito control measures. The DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres, Student Health Service Centres and Special Assessment Centres also advise pregnant women, infant carers and students on symptoms and preventive measures of mosquito-borne diseases.

To strengthen support for ethnic minority communities, essential information on CF has also been translated into 10 ethnic minority languages (namely Hindi, Nepali, Urdu, Thai, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Punjabi, Sinhala and Bengali) and uploaded to the CHPwebsite (www.chp.gov.hk/en/static/104022.html).

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

在擬議的規管制度下，提供網約車服務的平台、車輛及司機均須領取合適的牌證，並滿足運輸署所施加的牌證條件。政府將就申請營運的平台設立入場門檻（包括須為在香港註冊公司、營運經驗、財力證明、資本投入、董事資格等），平台亦須維持適當且具效率的服務，並對旗下車輛和司機進行盡職審查。網約車方面，政府建議車輛須由個人名義登記並只能由登記車主提供服務；而車輛須持有合適的第三者風險保險以及按規定展示標識以供識別。至於網約車司機方面，政府建議申請人須符合一系列條件及完成指定考核。有關條件包括年滿21歲及持有香港永久性居民身分證，以及在申請日期前五年內無嚴重交通定罪紀錄等。

發言人表示：「政府於今年七月就有關規管框架的立法建議諮詢立法會交通事務委員會，議員一致支持政府就提供網約車服務的平台、車輛及司機作出規管，亦支持政府先向立法會提交主體法例修訂以訂明原則性事宜，並在下階段透過附屬法例或牌證條件處理其他技術細節，以期盡快落實網約車服務的規管，回應市民的訴求。」

發言人續說：「感謝立法會議員支持政府全速推進有關規管網約車服務的立法工作，我們會積極配合立法會的審議工作，並爭取在本屆立法會任期完結前通過《條例草案》。」

政府將於九月十日向立法會提交《條例草案》進行首讀和二讀。"
註冊中醫涉嫌處方未標西藥成分的藥膏被捕（附圖）,2025-09-04 17:45,2025-09-04 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400600.htm,"衞生署今日（九月四日）表示，佐敦一名註冊中醫涉嫌向病人處方含有未標示西藥成分的藥膏（見圖）而被捕，市民如曾獲處方該款藥膏應停止使用。

衞生署早前根據情報，突擊搜查位於佐敦嘉賓大廈註冊中醫莊世華的處所，並檢獲一批藥膏。政府化驗所的檢驗結果顯示，一款沒有標籤的黃色藥膏樣本含有未標示西藥「醋酸地塞米松」、「咪康唑」及「撲熱息痛」成分。因應化驗結果，衞生署今日通知警方，並拘捕該名涉嫌非法管有第1部毒藥及未經註冊藥劑製品的註冊中醫。

「醋酸地塞米松」屬皮質類固醇，為第1部毒藥及處方藥物，用於治療炎症，不適當使用皮質類固醇可引致嚴重副作用，例如庫欣氏症候群，即出現圓臉及肌肉萎縮等病徵。「咪康唑」亦為第1部毒藥，常用於治療皮膚受真菌感染的藥物，外用可引致皮膚痕癢、刺激性及過敏反應等副作用。「撲熱息痛」普遍用作退燒及鎮痛，使用過量可引致肝臟及腎臟受損。

衞生署會繼續調查事件，並已要求涉事中醫通知曾獲處方上述藥膏的病人停止使用該藥膏。

根據《藥劑業及毒藥條例》（第138章），非法管有第1部毒藥及未經註冊藥劑製品均屬刑事罪行，一經定罪，每項罪行最高罰則為罰款100,000元及監禁兩年。待調查工作完成後，衞生署會就檢控事宜徵詢律政司的意見。署方亦會將個案轉介香港中醫藥管理委員會，以考慮是否需要採取紀律行動。

曾獲上述中醫處方藥膏的市民，如有不適或懷疑，應盡快徵詢醫護人員的意見。市民可在辦公時間內，將有關藥物送交九龍觀塘巧明街100號Landmark East友邦九龍大樓16樓衞生署中醫藥規管辦公室銷毀。"
Registered Chinese medicine practitioner arrested for allegedly prescribing cream product containing undeclared Western drug ingredients (with photo),2025-09-04 17:45,2025-09-04 18:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400603.htm,"The Department of Health (DH) today (September 4) said that a registered Chinese medicine practitioner (CMP) practising in Jordan was arrested for allegedly prescribing a cream product (see photo) containing undeclared Western drug ingredients to patients. Members of the public should stop using the cream if they have been prescribed the product concerned.

  Acting upon intelligence, the DH raided the premises of registered CMP Chong Sai-wa Andy at Champion Building in Jordan and seized a batch of the cream product for analysis. Test result from the Government Laboratory confirmed that an unlabelled yellow cream sample contained undeclared Western drug ingredients, namely dexamethasone acetate, miconazole and paracetamol. In light of the test result, the DH notified the Police today, and the registered CMP was arrested on suspicion of illegally possessing Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products.

  Dexamethasone acetate, a corticosteroid, is a Part 1 poison and prescription medicine for treating inflammation. Inappropriate use of corticosteroids may cause serious side effects such as Cushing's syndrome, with symptoms including moon face and muscle atrophy. Miconazole, also a Part 1 poison, is an antifungal medicine commonly used for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin. It can cause side effects such as itching, irritation and an allergic reaction when used topically. Paracetamol is commonly used for its anti-pyretic and analgesic effects, but an overdose may cause liver and kidney damage.

  The DH will continue to investigate the case and has requested the CMP concerned to contact his patients who have been prescribed the above cream product to stop using it.

  According to the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138), illegal possession of Part 1 poisons and unregistered pharmaceutical products are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for each offenceupon conviction is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. Upon completion of the investigations, the DH will consult the Department of Justice on prosecution matters. The DH will refer the case to the Chinese Medicine Council of Hong Kong for consideration of possible disciplinary action.

  Members of the public who have been prescribed the cream product by the above CMP who feel unwell or are in doubt should consult healthcare professionals as soon as possible. They may submit the medicines concerned to the DH's Chinese Medicine Regulatory Office at 16/F, AIA Kowloon Tower, Landmark East, 100 How Ming Street, Kwun Tong, Kowloon, during office hours for disposal."

FEHD releases 12th batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August,2025-09-04 17:00,2025-09-04 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400326.htm,"ããThe Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (September 4) released the 12th batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in August, covering eight survey areas, as follows:




District

Among the 12th batch of Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering eight survey areas in August, all were below 10 per cent.

The FEHD has so far released 12 batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in August 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 45 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. July 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Fourteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

âFollowing the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

八月份第12批涵蓋八個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年八月共12批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年七月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，45個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有14區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

Voters to follow voting procedures in 2025 Election Committee Subsector By-elections to be held this Sunday,2025-09-04 16:00,2025-09-04 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400495.htm,"The 2025 Election Committee Subsector (ECSS) By-elections will be held this Sunday (September 7) and the polling hours are from 9am to 6pm. The Registration and Electoral Office (REO) reminds voters/authorised representatives (ARs) concerned to follow the instructions on their poll card and bring the original of their valid Hong Kong identity (HKID) card to vote at their designated polling station.

 A spokesman for the REO said today (September 4), ""In accordance with the law, only registered voters/ARs in the 2025 final register of voters for Election Committee subsectors who belong to contested subsectors are eligible to vote on the polling day. The six contested subsectors are commercial (third); architectural, surveying, planning and landscape; technology and innovation; labour; representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of Hong Kong and Kowloon; and representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees of the New Territories.

""Voters/ARs of the six subsectors may use 'iAM Smart' or the voter registration website (vr.gov.hk) to log in to the Online Voter Information Enquiry System to check polling information such as the name and address of their designated polling station and its location on the map, the polling hours, as well as the Introduction to Candidates. They can also call the election hotline (2891 1001) for enquiries.""

 On the polling day, there will be 28 candidates contesting a total of 21 seats in six subsectors. Five ordinary polling stations located in the Exhibition Gallery of Hong Kong Central Library, Kowloon Park Sports Centre, Wai Tsuen Sports Centre, Tiu Keng Leng Sports Centre and Che Kung Temple Sports Centre, and one dedicated polling station at Happy Valley Police Station will be set up for about 3 600 voters/ARs of the contested subsectors.

Polling arrangements

  A voter or an AR must produce the original of his/her valid HKID card at the ballot paper issuing desk in the polling station. The polling staff will scan the HKID card of the voter or AR using a tablet of the Electronic Poll Register System to verify his/her identity and issue the ballot paper(s) upon verification.

 When marking the ballot paper, voters/ARs must fill in the ovals opposite the names of the candidates of their choice with the black pen provided at the polling station, and vote for no more than the prescribed number of seats in the relevant subsector, otherwise the ballot paper will be regarded as invalid.

 The spokesman said, ""Ballot paper checking machines will be set up at the polling stations for voters/ARs to check whether the ballot paper has been marked according to the electoral law. The ballot paper checking machines will not record or count the choice(s) marked on the ballot paper. Having checked the ballot paper, voters/ARs should insert the unfolded ballot paper into the ballot box with the marked side facing down. It is in principle alright for voters/ARs to bring along a piece of paper listing the names or numbers of the candidates of their choice for easy reference when marking the ballot papers. Nevertheless, voters/ARs should bear in mind that they should not show the paper to other people inside the polling station and they should take the paper with them when leaving the polling station. Otherwise, the voters/ARs concerned may violate the electoral law,"" the spokesman said.

 Based on the principles of the autonomy of voting and secrecy of votes, it is prohibited under the law to have anyone (even for the voter/AR's relative or friend) to accompany or assist the voter to cast his/her vote. If necessary, a voter/an AR may ask the Presiding Officer or his/her deputy to mark the ballot paper on the voter/AR's behalf in the presence of a member of the polling staff as witness. It is an offence for any voter/AR to disturb others, use electronic devices for communication, take photographs, or make a video or audio recording at a polling station.

 The spokesman said that the introduction booklets on candidates printed by the REO will be displayed at all polling stations for reference by voters/ARs.

Special arrangements at polling stations

 Two queues will be set up at the polling stations. One queue is for people aged 70 or above, pregnant women and those who are not able to queue for a long time or have difficulty in queuing due to their physical condition, while the other queue is for other voters/ARs. The Presiding Officers will flexibly deploy ballot paper issuing desks depending on the queuing situation.

 A certain area outside each polling station will be designated as a no canvassing zone to ensure that voters/ARs can gain access to the polling stations without interference. A no staying zone will also be designated outside the entrance and exit of a polling station. No one is allowed to stay in the no staying zone or be allowed to canvass for votes or conduct ""de-facto canvassing"" such as making hand gestures and greetings in the no canvassing zone.

 Enquiries about the By-elections on the polling day can be made to the election hotline at 2891 1001, which will operate from 8.30am to 6.30pm that day. A complaints hotline (2827 7251/3707 0188) will be in service from 9am to 6.30pm that day to handle complaints about breaches of electoral rules or guidelines.

Counting arrangements

 Once the poll is closed, the ballot boxes will be delivered to the Central Counting Station at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre for counting. Candidates, election agents and counting agents may enter the Central Counting Station and observe the count at designated areas of the counting zone. Members of the public and media may also enter the public area of the Central Counting Station to observe the count. A notice setting out the maximum capacity of members of the public in the public area will be displayed outside the Central Counting Station.

 Once the counting of votes is completed, the Returning Officers will declare the election results at the Central Counting Station. The REO will also arrange for the Returning Officers to announce again the election results of each subsector on the stage of the Media Centre. The election results will also be displayed outside the Central Counting Station and published via press releases and the election website (www.elections.gov.hk).

 For enquiries, please call the election hotline on 2891 1001 or visit the election website for more information on the By-elections."

Secretary for Health leads delegation to Beijing (with photos),2025-09-04 15:50,2025-09-04 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400243.htm,"  The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, led a delegation to call on the National Health Commission (NHC), the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) and the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in Beijing today (September 4) to introduce the latest developments in various healthcare policies in Hong Kong.

  During the meeting with the Commissioner of the NATCM, Professor Yu Yanhong, this morning, Professor Lo introduced her to the latest Chinese medicine (CM) developments in Hong Kong and the formulation of the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint, which will be released at the end of this year. He said, ""The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to the high-quality and high-standard development of CM on all fronts, and has continued to step up its efforts and devote more resources in recent years to pursue and implement various initiatives. The two flagship institutions for CM development, namely The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong and the permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute, with services to be commenced in phases from December this year, will be conducive to Hong Kong's further development in areas such as CM clinical services, talent training, and testing standards.""

  He also mentioned that the HKSAR Government will host the 7th Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) Conference on Inheritance, Innovation and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine in December. Representatives from the two special administrative regions and nine municipalities of the Guangdong Province of the GBA, as well as authoritative Mainland and overseas CM experts and scholars, will gather in Hong Kong for exchanges and to jointly witness various significant milestones in CM development in Hong Kong.

  Professor Lo then met with Vice-Minister of the NHC Professor Cao Xuetao, and mentioned that public hospitals in Hong Kong have been adopting various national healthcare standards for accreditation in recent years. Professor Lo said, ""By adopting national healthcare standards for accreditation, healthcare institutions in the HKSAR not only can enhance their healthcare professional standards and service quality but also facilitate their alignment with the national healthcare service system. This can also demonstrate the excellence of the national healthcare standards to the international community through fully leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantages of having strong support from the motherland and close connection with the world, thereby facilitating the national standards to go global.""

  Following the successful accreditation of two public hospitals, namely Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital, under China's International Hospital Accreditation Standards (2021 Version), the HKSAR Government is promoting the adoption of the Standards for accreditation in more public hospitals under the Hospital Authority (HA). Furthermore, in line with the relevant policy initiatives set out in the Chief Executive's Policy Address, the HA is establishing chest pain centres and stroke centres in accordance with national accreditation standards at suitable public hospitals. Of these, the chest pain centre at Queen Mary Hospital was successfully accredited in May this year, becoming the first nationally accredited chest pain centre in Hong Kong.

  During the meeting, Professor Lo also touched upon co-operation with the Mainland in the field of cancer. He said, ""The National Cancer Center has extensive experience in cancer prevention and treatment. Both sides will continue to strive for the goals of 'equally high-calibre technology with the available resources, pooling our talent to strike win-win co-operation', and uphold the principle of 'complementarity and mutual benefits', while deepening and expanding the strategic collaboration to continuously improve the professional standard in cancer prevention and treatment, thereby improving the health and well-being of the people.""

  In the afternoon, Professor Lo met with the Commissioner of the NMPA, Mr Li Li, to introduce various key initiatives for developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. Professor Lo said, ""The HKSAR Government is actively preparing for the establishment of the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) next year, and will implement the 'primary evaluation' for new drugs registration in phases starting next year. The establishment of the CMPR will considerably enhance Hong Kong's health and medical innovation, and facilitate the Mainland's innovative drugs and medical devices to go global, benefitting the people of Hong Kong and other regions.

  ""At the same time, the HKSAR Government has established the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute and is preparing to establish the Real-World Study and Application Centre in response to the national strategies and policy guidance. The HKSAR Government aspires to collaborate with the GBA cities to jointly establish the GBA as a leading hub for health and medical innovation at both national and global levels, while sparing no effort in developing new quality productive forces, and promoting the development of clinical trials and the biomedical industry, thereby serving the country's needs with Hong Kong's own strengths.""

  Members of the delegation include the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; Deputy Secretary for Health Mr Eddie Lee; and the Chief Executive of the HA, Dr Libby Lee. Professor Lo will return to Hong Kong tonight. During his absence, the Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan, is the Acting Secretary for Health."

  盧寵茂教授早上與國家中醫藥管理局局長余艷紅教授會面時，向她介紹香港中醫藥發展的最新情況，以及將於今年底公布的《中醫藥發展藍圖》的制訂工作。他說︰「香港特別行政區（特區）政府十分重視中醫藥全方位、高質量及高水平發展，近年持續加大力度並投放更多資源，積極推展和落實各項工作。香港中醫醫院和政府中藥檢測中心永久大樓兩個中醫藥發展旗艦機構於今年十二月起分階段投入服務後，將有助香港在中醫藥臨床服務、人才培訓和檢測標準等領域進一步發展。」

  他又提及特區政府將於十二月承辦「第七屆粵港澳大灣區中醫藥傳承創新發展大會」，屆時來自大灣區三地九市代表及國內外中醫藥權威專家學者將匯聚香港作交流，並共同見證多項香港中醫藥發展的重要里程碑。

  隨後，盧寵茂教授與衞健委副主任曹雪濤院士會面，提到近年香港公立醫院積極採納各項國家醫療標準進行認證。盧寵茂教授說︰「特區醫療機構採納國家醫療標準進行認證，除了能提升自身的醫療專業水平與服務質量外，亦有助與國家醫療衞生服務體系接軌，並且充分發揮香港背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，向國際社會展示國家醫療標準的卓越性，助力國家醫療標準走向國際。」

  繼東區尤德夫人那打素醫院和威爾斯親王醫院兩家公立醫院成功通過《國際醫院評審認證標準（中國）》（2021版）評審認證，特區政府正推動醫院管理局（醫管局）轄下更多公立醫院採納該標準進行認證。此外，醫管局亦根據行政長官《施政報告》提出的相關政策，按國家認證標準於合適的公立醫院建設胸痛中心和中風中心。其中，瑪麗醫院的胸痛中心已於今年五月成功通過相關評審，成為香港首間獲國家認證的胸痛中心。」

  會上，盧寵茂教授亦談及與內地在癌症領域的合作。他說︰「國家癌症中心在癌症防治領域擁有豐富經驗，雙方會繼續秉持『資源聯動、技術同質、人才共用、合作共赢』的理念，並堅持『優勢互補、互利共贏』的原則，深化和拓展戰略協作，不斷提升癌症防治的專業水準，增進人民健康福祉。」

  下午，盧寵茂教授與藥監局局長李利會面時，向他介紹香港發展成為國際醫療創新樞紐的多項重要措施。盧寵茂教授表示︰「特區政府正積極籌備於明年成立香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心（藥械監管中心），並於明年分階段落實『第一層審批』新藥註冊機制。藥械監管中心的成立將大力推動香港的醫療創新，並助力國內創新藥械走向國際，惠及香港及其他地區的人民。」

  「同時，香港特區政府積極響應國家戰略與政策指引，成立粵港澳大灣區國際臨床試驗所，並正籌建真實世界研究及應用中心。特區政府期望透過粵港澳大灣區城市合作，共同將大灣區打造成為國家乃至全球領先的醫療創新高地，大力發展新質生產力，推動臨床試驗及生物醫藥產業發展，以香港所長，貢獻國家所需。」

  代表團成員包括衞生署署長林文健醫生、醫衞局副秘書長李力綱和醫管局行政總裁李夏茵醫生。盧寵茂教授將於今晚返港，在他離港期間，醫衞局副局長范婉雯醫生署任醫衞局局長。"

SFC-HKMA joint survey shows record investment product sales and market participation in 2024,2025-09-04 12:05,2025-09-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090300533.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) today(September 4) published the findings of their annual joint survey on the distribution of non-exchange-traded investment products, showing record sales and level of market participation for these products during 2024 (Note 1).

Total transaction amount of non-exchange-traded investment products by licensed corporations (LCs) and registered institutions (RIs) surged 40per cent year-on-year to a record $6,073 billion in 2024 (Note 2). Market participation also witnessed broad-based growth last year. The number of firms engaged in the sale of investment products grew by 9per cent to a new high of 414, with an overwhelming 46per cent more than doubling their sales year-on-year. The number of large firms saw a 12per cent increase to 101 (Note 3). Also setting new record highs are the manpower deployed to distribute investment products, which rose by 4per cent to more than 19 000, and the number of clients completing at least one transaction, which increased by 28per cent to over 1.2 million (Note 4).

All major investment product types recorded significant sales growth in 2024. Sales of authorised collective investment schemes (CIS) grew 96per cent to $1,400 billion and unauthorised CIS grew 50per cent to $844 billion. Sales of structured products and debt securities increased by 30per cent and 29per cent year-on-year, respectively. Respondent firms generally observed stronger investor sentiment compared with the previous year as investors actively pursued products that suit their risk appetites and investment goals.

Equity-linked products thrived amidst strong market momentum and remained the top-selling structured product category with sales of $1,729 billion, up 43per cent year-on-year. Meanwhile, money market funds and sovereign bonds remained attractive to investors due to their perceived lower risks and decent returns under the prevailing high interest rate environment in 2024. The survey showed an increase in the sales of money market funds, which accounted for 80per cent of the total transaction amount of the top five CIS reported by the large firms, up from 76per cent in 2023. Sovereign bonds also gained popularity, making up 49per cent of total debt securities sold last year, compared with 44per cent in the year before.

""The remarkable surge in product sales underscores the dedication of firms and the trust investors place in our financial markets,"" said the Executive Director of Intermediaries of the SFC, Dr Eric Yip. ""The SFC is steadfast in fostering a robust regulatory framework that enables businesses to grow while protecting investor interests.""

  ""The strong growth in investment transactions reflects heightened investor confidence and interest in the vibrancy of Hong Kong's investment market, and supports the continuous growth and development of the ecosystem,"" said the Executive Director (Banking Conduct) of the HKMA, Mr Alan Au. ""The survey result enables regulators to better co-ordinate and implement our supervisory activities in light of market developments, thus according protection to investors.""

Other major observations from the survey included:


Structured products remained the top product type sold by the respondent firms, accounting for 42per cent ($2,567 billion) of the total transaction amount in 2024. CIS and debt securities rounded out the top three spots, making up 37per cent ($2,244 billion) and 15per cent ($941 billion) respectively.
Equity-linked products made up 67per cent of all structured products sold in 2024, up from 61per cent in 2023. The major underlying equities of the top five products reported by the large firms were from the technology (42per cent), automotive (23per cent) and internet (22per cent) sectors.
Online sales accounted for 17per cent (2023: 12per cent) of the aggregate transaction amount reported by all respondent firms. The number of respondent firms that distributed investment products online continued to grow in 2024, increasing 13per cent to 104. CIS remained the top product type sold through online platforms, making up 77per cent of the total online sales, followed by debt securities at 21per cent.


Note 1: The annual survey questionnaires were sent to 2 368 LCs and 109 RIs licensed or registered for Type 1 (dealing in securities), Type 4 (advising on securities) or both regulated activities, and more than 99per cent of them responded. The survey covered the sale of non-exchange-traded investment products from January 1 to December 31, 2024 (the reporting period) by respondent firms to non-professional investor clients, individual professional investors (PIs) and certain corporate PIs. The first SFC-HKMA joint survey was published in 2021.

Note 2:Transaction amount refers to the amount paid or payable by investors for investment products. For structured products and derivative products, the transaction amount refers to the maximum exposure of the contracts at the point of sale. Respondent firms were requested to report only one side of the transaction. Rollovers, redemptions and position close-outs were not included.

Note 3:Large firms refer to LCs and RIs with total transactions of $1 billion or more and $30 billion or more respectively during the reporting period. They were requested to provide details about the investment products sold, including the transaction amount by investor type and the details of the top five products ranked by transaction amount.

在二○二四年，持牌法團和註冊機構的非交易所買賣投資產品的總交易額按年飆升40%至破紀錄的60,730億元（註二）。市場參與度於去年亦錄得廣泛增長。從事投資產品銷售的公司數目上升9%至414家的新高，當中多達46%的公司的銷售錄得一倍以上的按年增幅。大型公司數目上升12%至101家（註三）。此外，負責分銷投資產品的人員增加4%至超過19 000名，而完成至少一項交易的客戶則增加28%至超過120萬名，數目均創下歷史新高（註四）。

在二○二四年，所有主要投資產品種類均錄得顯著的銷售增長。認可集體投資計劃的銷售上升96%至14,000億元，而非認可集體投資計劃則增長50%至8,440億元。結構性產品及債務證券的銷售分別按年上升30%及29%。受訪公司普遍觀察到投資者情緒較一年前高漲，積極追求符合其風險胃納及投資目標的產品。

股票掛鈎產品在強勁的市場動力下蓬勃發展，並依然是最暢銷的結構性產品種類，其銷售達17,290億元，按年增長43%。同時，貨幣市場基金及主權債券被認為風險較低且在二○二四年當時的高息環境下提供可觀回報，因此對投資者仍有吸引力。調查顯示，貨幣市場基金的銷售有所增長，佔大型公司呈報的首五大集體投資計劃總交易額的比例由二○二三年的76%升至80%。主權債券亦受到歡迎，佔去年所銷售債務證券總交易額的49%，而前年則為44%。

證監會中介機構部執行董事葉志衡博士表示：「產品銷售顯著上升，突顯了這些公司對本港金融市場的投入及投資者對市場的信任。證監會堅定不移地建立穩健的監管框架，讓企業能夠發展，同時保障投資者利益。」

金管局助理總裁（銀行操守）區毓麟表示：「投資交易的強勁增長，反映投資者對香港投資市場活力的信心及興趣，並支持市場生態持續增長和發展。調查結果有助監管機構因應市場發展更有效地協調和落實監管工作，從而保障投資者。」

從是次調查觀察到的其他要點包括：


在二○二四年，結構性產品依然是受訪公司銷售最多的產品種類，佔總交易額的42%（25,670億元）。集體投資計劃及債務證券亦位列三甲，分別佔37%（22,440億元）及15%（9,410億元）。




股票掛鈎產品佔二○二四年銷售的全部結構性產品的67%，高於二○二三年的61%。在大型公司呈報的首五大產品中，相關股票以科技（42%）、汽車（23%）及互聯網（22%）行業為主。




網上銷售佔所有受訪公司呈報的總交易額的17%（二○二三年：12%）。在二○二四年，於網上分銷投資產品的受訪公司數目持續增長13%至104家。集體投資計劃仍然是網上平台上銷售最多的產品種類，佔網上銷售總額的77%，其次是佔21%的債務證券。


註一：證監會與金管局向就第1類（證券交易）及／或第4類（就證券提供意見）受規管活動獲發牌或註冊的公司（包括2 368家持牌法團及109家註冊機構）發出年度調查問卷，並獲得超過99%公司的回覆。是次調查涵蓋受訪公司在二○二四年一月一日至十二月三十一日期間（匯報期）向非專業投資者客戶、個人專業投資者及部分法團專業投資者銷售非交易所買賣投資產品的情況。證監會與金管局於二○二一年發表首份聯合調查。

註二：交易額是指投資者就投資產品已付或應付的金額。就結構性產品及衍生工具產品而言，交易額是指在銷售時合約所承擔最高風險的金額。受
訪公司只需匯報單邊交易，而滾轉、贖回及平倉的交易額則無需匯報。

註三：大型公司是指在匯報期內總交易額分別達10億元或以上及300億元或以上的持牌法團及註冊機構。它們需提供所銷售的投資產品的詳情，包括按投資者類型劃分的交易額，及就交易額而言，首五大投資產品的詳情。

註四：在匯報期內完成至少一項非交易所買賣投資產品交易的持牌法團及註冊機構客戶數目分別為493 829名及714 926名。"

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-09-04 12:00,2025-09-04 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090400356.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

DH cracks down on unlicensed medicine shops illegally selling controlled medicines (with photos),2025-09-04 11:00,2025-09-04 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/04/P2025090300751.htm,"âThe Department of Health (DH) yesterday (September 3) conducted a joint operation with the Police in Sham Shui Po District to crack down on unlicensed medicine shops illegally selling controlled medicines. During the operation, controlled drugs were seized and two people were arrested.

The DH received intelligence indicating that two unlicensed medicine shops located in Pak Tin were suspected of illegally selling or possessing controlled medicines. The DH, in collaboration with the Police, took enforcement action at the two premises concerned. During the operation, 125 types of controlled drugs were discovered on the premises. A 39-year-old woman and a 36-year-old man present at the scene were arrested on suspicion of illegally selling Part 2 poisons and illegally possessing Part 1 poisons and antibiotics respectively.

  A preliminary investigation indicated that the products seized during the operation included substances classified as Part 1 poisons or Part 2 poisons under the Pharmacy and Poisons Ordinance (Cap. 138) (PPO), and antibiotic substances under the Antibiotics Ordinance (Cap. 137) (AO). Some of the products also did not bear Hong Kong registration numbers for pharmaceutical products as required by law and were labelled only in foreign languages (including Japanese and English).

The DH will continue to follow up and investigate the incident.

According to the PPO, all pharmaceutical products must be registered with the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong before they can be legally sold in the market. Additionally, only persons authorised by the Board as Authorized Sellers of Poisons (ASPs) are allowed to conduct the relevant retail business of selling poisons listed in Part 1 and Part 2 of the Poisons List at Schedule 10 of the Pharmacy and Poisons Regulations (Cap. 138A) at premises registered by the Board, whereas Listed Sellers of Poisons can only conduct the retail business of selling poisons listed in Part 2 of the Poisons List. Illegal sale or possession of unregistered pharmaceutical products or Part 1 poisons and illegal sale of Part 2 poisons are criminal offences. The maximum penalty for each offence is a fine of $100,000 and two years' imprisonment. Moreover, according to the AO, ASPs can only sell antibiotics with the authority of a doctor's prescription. The maximum penalty for illegal sale or possession of antibiotics is a fine of $50,000 and 12 months' imprisonment.

The DH strongly urges members of the public not to buy or use unregistered pharmaceutical products as their safety, efficacy and quality are not guaranteed. All registered pharmaceutical products should carry a Hong Kong registration number on the package in the format of ""HK-XXXXX"". Members of the public should not self-medicate without advice from healthcare professionals. They should stop using them and consult healthcare professionals if they are in doubt or feeling unwell after use. They may visit the website of the Drug Office of the DH for ""General Knowledge on the Use of Medicines"" for information."

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Two men convicted and jailed for importing and possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photos),2025-09-03 19:30,2025-09-03 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300694.htm,"  A local man and an incoming male passenger were sentenced to four months' imprisonment and six weeks' imprisonment respectively by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (September 3) for importing and possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes, as well as for failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO) and the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

  Customs officers intercepted a 48-year-old local man, who was carrying a batch of goods on a bike, for inspection at the Chung Ying Street Checkpoint in Sha Tau Kok on April 10. Upon inspection, a total of 37 237 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from eight carton boxes of the consignment and a shoulder bag carried by the man. The man was subsequently arrested. The estimated market value of the duty-not-paid cigarettes was about $186,000 and the duty potential was about $123,000. He was sentenced to four months' imprisonment today.

  In addition, Customs officers intercepted an incoming 62-year-old male passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (September 2) and seized 2 227 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $9,100 and a duty potential of about $7,400 from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment today.

  Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public not to defy the law. Under the IEO, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

  Under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years. 

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
​兩名男子進口及管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-09-03 19:30,2025-09-03 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/03/P2025090300692.htm,"一名本地男子和一名入境男旅客因進口及管有未完稅香煙，以及未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《進出口條例》和《應課稅品條例》，今日（九月三日）在粉嶺裁判法院分別被判處監禁四個月和監禁六星期。

海關人員四月十日在沙頭角中英街檢查站截查一名以單車運送一批貨物的四十八歲本地男子。經檢查後，海關人員在貨物中的八個紙箱內及在該男子身上的肩背包中檢獲共三萬七千二百三十七支未完稅香煙，他隨即被捕。該批未完稅香煙市值約十八萬六千元，應課稅值約十二萬三千元。他今日被判處監禁四個月。

另外，海關人員昨日（九月二日）在羅湖管制站截查一名六十二歲抵港男旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲共二千二百二十七支未完稅香煙，估計市值約九千一百元，應課稅值約七千四百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁六星期。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映不論是否屬於初犯，亦可能被判處監禁。監禁判刑具相當阻嚇作用，並充分反映罪行的嚴重性。

海關提醒市民切勿以身試法。根據《進出口條例》，任何人輸入或輸出未列艙單貨物，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款二百萬元及監禁七年。

根據《應課稅品條例》，任何人若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
