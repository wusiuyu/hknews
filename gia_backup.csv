Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan,2025-08-04 15:40,2025-08-04 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400598.htm,"  In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.

  For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.

  From noon on August 1 to noon today (August 4), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 335 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the ""aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt"" category, in the past three days (including last Saturday and Sunday). No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled ""Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan"" (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html).

  In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 150 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website (www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html).

  The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website
(www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html).

  From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 155 820 samples of food imported from Japan (including 102 137 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 35 346 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests."

Employer sanctioned for violating requirements of local recruitment under Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme,2025-08-04 15:00,2025-08-04 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400316.htm,"âThe Labour Department (LD) today (August 4) announced that it has imposed an administrative sanction on Amala Limited and, from July 31, 2025, it will refuse to process any applications for importing labour under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme (ESLS) submitted by the company for a period of one year. At the same time, the LD has terminated the processing of an application previously submitted by the company.

""An administrative sanction has been imposed on the company, as it earlier refused to employ a qualified local job seeker during the four-week local recruitment under the ESLS without reasonable grounds, violating the requirements of local recruitment,"" a spokesman for the LD said.

The spokesman continued, ""The ESLS stipulates that if an employer violates labour or immigration laws, the requirements of the ESLS or the Standard Employment Contract, the LD will impose an administrative sanction on the employer, including the withdrawal of approval for the importation of labour previously granted and refusal to process any subsequent applications submitted by the employer.""

The spokesman reminded employers applying for the importation of labour under the ESLS to strictly comply with the requirements of the ESLS, including according priority to employing qualified local workers.

To safeguard employment priority for local workers, the LD has implemented a series of enhancement measures, including launching an online complaint form on the ESLS dedicated webpage (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/plan/iwESLS.htm) to enable local employees and imported workers to lodge complaints against employers for suspected violations of the scheme requirements.

勞工處發言人說：「在熱帶氣旋或暴雨警告取消後，僱員如遇到實際困難而未能及時返回工作崗位，僱主應予以體諒並作出彈性處理，例如讓僱員分批復工、容許返回工作崗位有困難的僱員遙距工作（如適用）或有較寬裕的上班和復工時間。」

發言人提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

Employers and employees should make reasonable work arrangements after tropical cyclones or rainstorms,2025-08-04 13:29,2025-08-04 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400451.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 4) reminded employers to make practical and reasonable work arrangements for employees after the cancellation of tropical cyclone warnings or rainstorm warnings, with due consideration to the road and traffic conditions and other factors, and make flexible arrangements for staff to resume work or work remotely (if applicable). This will help maintain good labour-management relations, and ensure the safety of employees as well as the smooth operation of organisations.
  
  ""For staff who have genuine difficulties in resuming work on time upon cancellation of a tropical cyclone or rainstorm warning, employers should be sympathetic and handle each case flexibly. For example, employers may allow employees to resume work in stages, permit employees who have difficulties in returning to workplaces to work remotely (if applicable) or allow more time for them to report for duty and resume work,"" an LD spokesman said.
  
  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.
  
  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume duty on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonus or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" the spokesman said.
  
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

Employers and employees should make work arrangements in times of rainstorm warnings,2025-08-04 12:37,2025-08-04 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400381.htm,"  The Labour Department (LD) today (August 4) reminded employers to make prior work arrangements for employees during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions as early as possible, including arrangements on reporting for duty, release from work, resumption of work and remote work (if applicable). These arrangements not only can ensure the safety of employees and smooth operation of organisations, but also are conducive to maintaining good labour-management relations.

  ""Employers should make prior work arrangements and contingency measures for staff which are reasonably practicable. In drawing up and implementing the work arrangements, employers should give prime consideration to employees' safety and the feasibility of employees travelling to and from their workplaces. Employers should also give consideration as much as possible to the different situations faced by individual employees, such as their place of residence and the road and traffic conditions in the vicinity, and adopt a sympathetic and flexible approach with due regard to their actual difficulties and needs,"" an LD spokesman said.

  To avoid misunderstandings, disputes and confusion, employers should consult and engage employees when drawing up the arrangements and make appropriate updates or amendments based on the experience of each occasion and the needs of both employers and employees as well as the actual situations. The work arrangements should cover the following matters:

* arrangements in respect of reporting for duty;
* arrangements in respect of early release from work;
* arrangements in respect of resumption of work (e.g. the number of hours within which employees should resume duty after the warning concerned is cancelled or extreme conditions come to an end, when safety and traffic conditions allow);
* arrangements in respect of remote work such as work from home (if applicable) (e.g. duty and work arrangements during and after rainstorm warnings and extreme conditions);
* arrangements regarding working hours, wages and allowances (e.g. calculation of wages and allowances in respect of reporting for duty and absence); and
* special arrangements in respect of staff required to report for duty in times of adverse weather or extreme conditions.

  ""Employers should conduct a timely and realistic assessment of whether there is any need for requiring staff to report for duty at workplaces when rainstorm warning or extreme conditions are in force. In making the assessment, employers should take into account the safety of employees, the business nature, operational needs and urgency of service, with due regard to the manpower requirements, staffing establishment and individual situations of employees, and keep the number of staff at workplaces to the minimum as far as possible,"" the spokesman added.

  If a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is issued during working hours, employees working indoors should continue to work as usual unless it is dangerous to do so. Supervisors of employees working outdoors or in exposed areas should suspend outdoor duties as soon as practicable. They should arrange for their employees to take shelter temporarily and resume duty only when weather conditions permit. If the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal is still in force by the end of working hours, employees should stay in a safe place until the heavy rain has passed. A suitable area in the workplace should be made available by employers as temporary shelter for employees.

  If the Government makes an extreme conditions announcement, apart from those required by employers to report for duty at workplaces, employees are advised to stay in the place they are currently in or in safe places when extreme conditions are in force, instead of heading for work. Employees who have already reported for duty at workplaces could continue to work as usual in a safe manner. If the workplaces are in danger, employers should release staff from work early under feasible conditions and in a safe manner or make available a safe place as temporary shelter for employees. If the working time ends while extreme conditions are still in force, employers can release employees from workplaces in a safe manner or provide a suitable area as temporary shelter for those still at workplaces.

  If it is necessary for employees to report for duty at workplaces under adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should discuss and agree with them in advance the duty arrangements and contingency measures. If public transport services are suspended or limited when the Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force, employers should provide safe transport services for employees travelling to and from workplaces, or grant them an extra travelling allowance.

  The spokesman reminded employers to observe the statutory liabilities and requirements under the Employment Ordinance, Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance, Employees' Compensation Ordinance and Minimum Wage Ordinance.

  ""As natural calamities cannot be avoided, for employees who are not able to report for duty or resume work on time due to adverse weather or extreme conditions, employers should neither deduct their wages, good attendance bonuses or allowances, nor reduce employees' entitlement to annual leave, statutory holidays or rest days under the Employment Ordinance, or ask for additional hours of work from employees to compensate for the loss of working hours when they are unable to report for duty,"" he said.
 
  Employers should note that they have an obligation to provide and maintain a safe working environment for their employees under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance. If employees are required to work in times of tropical cyclone warnings, rainstorm warnings or extreme conditions, employers should ensure that the risks at work are reduced as far as reasonably practicable. Moreover, under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance, employers are liable to pay compensation for injuries or deaths incurred when employees are travelling by a direct route from their residence to their workplace, or from their workplace back to their residence after work, four hours before or after working hours on a day when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 or higher, a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal or extreme conditions are in force.

僱主僱員應訂立暴雨警告下的工作安排,2025-08-04 12:33,2025-08-04 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400385.htm,"勞工處今日（八月四日）提醒僱主應盡早預先訂明僱員在暴雨警告下及極端情況及其後的工作安排，包括上班、下班、復工及遙距工作（如適用）等。這些安排不但可以保障僱員安全及機構運作順暢，更有助維持良好的勞資關係。

勞工處發言人說：「僱主應預先制定合理而可行的工作安排和應變措施。在擬訂及執行有關安排時，應優先考慮僱員的安全和從居住地點往返工作地點的可行性等，亦應盡量體諒個別僱員可能面對的不同情況，如居住地點及附近的路面和交通等情況，並考慮當中的實際困難和需要，採納情理兼備及具彈性的處理方法。」

為避免誤解、爭議及混亂，僱主應在制定有關工作安排的過程中充分諮詢及考慮僱員的意見，並因應經驗和勞資雙方的需要及實際情況作出適當的更新或修訂。工作安排的內容應包括：

＊上班的安排；
＊在工作期間提早下班的安排；
＊復工的安排（例如在有關警告信號取消或極端情況結束後，在安全及交通情況許可下，僱員應在多少個小時內返回工作崗位）；
＊遙距工作（如在家工作）的安排（如適用）（例如在暴雨警告或極端情況下及其後的當值及工作安排）；
＊工作時數、工資和津貼的安排 （例如就當值或缺勤的工資及津貼的計算方法）；及
＊有關在惡劣天氣及極端情況下必須當值的僱員的特別安排。

發言人補充：「僱主應盡早確切評估在暴雨警告或極端情況生效期間，是否需要員工返回工作地點當值。僱主評估時，應考慮有關僱員的安全，並按行業性質、機構運作需要及服務的迫切性，在顧及人力需求、人事編制及僱員個別的情況下，盡量將於工作地點當值的人數減至最少。」

如果紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號在工作時間內發出，除非會有危險，否則在戶內工作的僱員應如常工作。至於在戶外或空曠地方工作的僱員，其主管人員應在可行的情況下，盡快暫停所有戶外工作，並安排僱員到安全的地方暫避，直至天氣情況許可，才恢復工作。如果黑色暴雨警告信號在下班時仍然生效，僱員應留在安全地方，直至大雨過去，僱主亦應在工作地點開放合適地方讓僱員暫避風雨。

如政府作出極端情況公布，除與僱主就此情況下已訂立返回工作地點上班協定的人員外，僱員應留在原來的地點或安全地點，不要啓程上班。已在工作地點當值的僱員，在安全情況下可如常工作；如工作地點有危險，在可行及安全的情況下，僱主應安排僱員提早下班或到安全的地方暫避。如工作時間在極端情況生效期間結束，僱主應在安全情況下安排僱員下班，或開放合適地方讓仍在工作地點的僱員暫避。

如必須安排僱員在惡劣天氣及極端情況下返回工作地點當值，僱主應預先與他們商討及協定當值安排及應變措施。在黑色暴雨警告信號及極端情況生效期間，如公共交通暫停或只提供有限度服務，僱主應為僱員提供安全接送往返工作地點的服務，或向他們另外發放交通津貼。

發言人亦提醒僱主必須遵守《僱傭條例》、《職業安全及健康條例》、《工廠及工業經營條例》、《僱員補償條例》及《最低工資條例》下應負的法定責任及規定。

他說：「由於自然災害屬無可避免，對於因惡劣天氣或極端情況而未能上班或及時返回工作崗位的僱員，僱主不應扣減他們的工資、勤工獎或津貼，亦不應減少僱員在《僱傭條例》下享有的年假、法定假日或休息日，或要求僱員以額外工作時數補償他們未能上班而減少的工作時間。」

根據《職業安全及健康條例》，僱主有責任為僱員提供及維持安全的工作環境。如僱主要求僱員在熱帶氣旋、暴雨警告或極端情況下工作，他們必須在合理及切實可行的範圍內把工作危險程度減至最低。另外，根據《僱員補償條例》，在八號或更高熱帶氣旋警告信號或紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號，或於極端情況生效期間，如僱員在其當日的工作時間開始前或終止後四小時內，以直接路線由其居所前往其工作地點途中，或在下班後由其工作地點返回其居所途中遭遇意外受傷或死亡，僱主必須負起補償的責任。

勞工處編製的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》，為僱主和僱員提供制定相關工作安排的主要原則、參考指引及相關法例資料，以供參考。該小冊子可在勞資關係科各分區辦事處索取，亦可在勞工處網頁（www.labour.gov.hk/tc/public/pdf/wcp/Rainstorm.pdf）下載。"

  Good morning, chair and distinguished fellow colleagues.

  On behalf of Hong Kong, China, I would like to begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Korea for the warm hospitality and impeccable arrangements for this meeting. It is an honour to stand among leaders who share a common vision - harnessing digital and AI innovation to address the profound socio-economic challenges across the Asia-Pacific region with precision, impact and inclusivity.

  AI is not just the future. It is the here and now. Among the emerging technologies reshaping our world, AI stands out as the defining force of our time. The numbers speak for themselves. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, AI is projected to become a US$4.8 trillion global market by 2033. This is not just an opportunity but a call to action. In Hong Kong, China, AI is at the forefront of our strategic agenda, as set out in the Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint. The blueprint underscores our commitment to turning ambition into action by advancing infrastructure, fostering cutting-edge research, and supporting enterprise innovation, thereby harnessing the power of AI to drive economic transformation, strengthen our tech-powered economy, and secure a sustainable future.

  To realise this vision, Hong Kong, China has made meticulous preparations to build the infrastructure and ecosystems needed to thrive in this AI-driven era. Among them, Cyberport, one of our major tech flagships, has set up an AI Supercomputing Centre to support the growing local demand for high performance computing power. We have also established two research clusters under our InnoHK platform, one of which focuses on AI and robotics technologies and houses the Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center (HKGAI), which developed Hong Kong's first large language foundation model.

  Here is what is more exciting. The HKGAI is set to launch the ""HKChat"", an AI-powered chatbot mobile app powered by our homegrown large language foundation model, bringing the benefits of AI directly to the public this year. Alongside setting up the Hong Kong AI R&D (research and development) Institute, we are doubling down on the R&D and industrial applications of AI.

  But we are not stopping there. Digital transformation is equally central to Hong Kong, China's strategy for public service excellence, economic upgrading and transformation. Our ""iAM Smart"" one-stop personalised digital services platform has already transformed how our people access government and commercial online services, providing a seamless, secure and efficient experience. By 2025, it will be the single portal for all online government services. And by the end of 2026, we will have rolled out the ""Digital Corporate Identity"" platform, which is set to be a game changer for businesses by enabling secure, convenient and frictionless transactions. We are confident that these advanced digital infrastructures will accelerate the development of the digital economy in Hong Kong, China, delivering greater benefits to our people and businesses.

  The promise of digital and AI innovation demands collaboration. Hong Kong, China stands ready to play a more constructive role in advancing this collective vision, advocating for the safe and responsible adoption of AI, ICT (information and communications technology) and digital technologies. By working together, we can boost productivity and efficiency, strengthen resilience, and foster innovation across the region. Let us seize this moment to drive inclusive growth, deepen regional ties, and secure a prosperous and sustainable future for every citizen in the Asia-Pacific region.

  Thank you."

根據《維護國家安全條例》指明危害國家安全罪行的潛逃者及指明針對有關潛逃者施行的措施,2025-08-04 11:35,2025-08-04 11:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400300.htm,"保安局局長於今日（八月四日）行使《維護國家安全條例》（2024年第6號）第89（1）條及第89（4）條所賦予的權力，藉在憲報刊登公告，指明十六名因涉嫌在香港特別行政區（特區）境外干犯危害國家安全罪行而被法院發出拘捕令的人，並指明針對這十六名有關潛逃者施行的措施。有關詳情列於2025年第43號號外公告及第44號號外公告。

十六名被指明的有關潛逃者為男子何良懋、女子陳麗珍、男子馮崇義、女子龔小夏、男子吳文昕、男子曾偉藩、女子錢寶芬、男子夏海俊、男子侯中宇、男子何永友、男子姜嘉偉、男子林千淦、女子吳文君、男子黃振華、男子黃修和及女子張信燕，各人在香港境外一直從事危害國家安全的行為和活動。

警務處國家安全處已於七月二十五日公布懸紅通緝上述十六名潛逃者以及男子袁弓夷、男子霍嘉誌、男子蔡明達。這十九名潛逃者在境外籌組、成立或參與一個名為「香港議會」的顛覆組織，涉嫌干犯《中華人民共和國香港特別行政區維護國家安全法》罪行。法院已應警方的申請，就上述十九名在逃人士發出拘捕令。

在上述在逃人士當中，保安局局長已於二○二四年六月和十二月先後行使《維護國家安全條例》第89條所賦予的權力，刊憲指明袁弓夷、霍嘉誌及蔡明達為潛逃者，並指明針對他們而施行的措施。

以下三項措施，就全部十六名今日被指明的有關潛逃者而適用：「禁止提供資金等或處理資金等」、「禁止與不動產相關的某些活動」及「與涉及有關潛逃者的合資企業或合夥相關的禁止」，而「撤銷特區護照等」亦適用於大部分有關潛逃者。此外，「暫時罷免董事職位」的措施，就個別有關潛逃者而適用。有關潛逃者涉嫌干犯的危害國家安全罪行及針對有關潛逃者而施行的措施詳列於附件。

政府發言人強調 : 「這些無法無天的通緝犯潛藏英國、美國、加拿大、德國、澳洲、泰國、中國台灣等地，並在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，並透過抹黑詆毀意圖煽動對中央和香港特區的憎恨，我們因此有需要採取是次措施強烈打擊。」

警方提醒市民，除獲得保安局局長批予的特許授權外，任何人直接或間接向有關潛逃者提供任何資金或其他財務資產或經濟資源（包括向有關潛逃者在網上建立的平台或專頁提供資金），或處理屬於或由其擁有或控制的任何資金或其他財務資產或經濟資源；將不動產租賃予或以其它方式提供予有關潛逃者，或向其租入不動產；與有關潛逃者成立合資企業、合夥或類似的關係，或投資於該等關係，即屬犯罪，一經定罪可處監禁七年。警方會對相關犯罪行為嚴正執法，呼籲社會大眾不要以身試法。

保安局局長已要求警方整理相關證據，以供其考慮行使《維護國家安全條例》第60條下的權力，禁止「香港議會」及「香港民主建國聯盟」在香港運作。"
Specification of absconders in respect of offences endangering national security and specification of measures applicable against relevant absconders under Safeguarding National Security Ordinance,2025-08-04 11:35,2025-08-04 11:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400303.htm," The Secretary for Security exercised the powers conferred by sections 89(1) and 89(4) of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (6 of 2024) today (August 4) to specify 16 persons who are subject to warrants of arrest issued by the court for being suspected of having committed offences endangering national security outside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and to specify the measures to be applied against the 16 relevant absconders by notices published in the Gazette. Details are set out in G.N. (E.) 43 of 2025 and G.N. (E.) 44 of 2025.

 The 16 specified relevant absconders are male Ho Leung-mau Victor, female Chan Lai-chun, male Feng Chongyi, female Gong Sasha, male Ng Man-yan, male Tsang Wai-fan, female Chin Po-fun, male Ha Hoi-chun, Paul, male Hau Chung-yu, male Ho Wing-yau, male Keung Ka-wai, male Lam Tony, female Ng Agnes, male Wong Chun-wah, male Wong Sau-wo and female Zhang Xinyan. All of them have persistently engaged in acts and activities endangering national security outside the HKSAR.

 The National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Forceannounced on July 25 that the above-mentioned 16 absconders and male Yuan Gong-yi, male Fok Ka-chi, male Choi Ming-da were put on the wanted list, with rewards offered in respect of each wanted person. These 19 absconders are suspected of committing offences under the Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong National Security Law) by organising, establishing, or participating in, outside the HKSAR, a subversive organisation named the ""Hong Kong Parliament"".The court has, upon application by the Police, issued arrest warrants against these 19 persons at large.

 Among the aforementioned fugitives, the Secretary for Security had already exercised powers conferred by section 89 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, in June and December 2024, to specify Yuan Gong-yi, Fok Ka-chi and Choi Ming-da as absconders and to specify the measures to be applied against them by notices published in the Gazette.

 The following three measures are applicable to all 16 relevant absconders specified today: ""Prohibition against making available funds etc. or dealing with funds etc."", ""Prohibition against certain activities in connection with immovable property"" and ""Prohibition in connection with joint ventures or partnerships with relevant absconders""; while the measure of ""Cancellation of HKSAR passports etc."" is applicable to most relevant absconders. In addition, the measure of ""Temporary removal from office of director"" is applicable to individual relevant absconders. The offences endangering national security suspected to have been committed by the relevant absconders and the measures applied against the relevant absconders are detailed in the Annex.

 A Government spokesperson stressed that, ""These lawless wanted criminals are hiding in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Germany, Australia, Thailand, China's Taiwan region, etc, and continue to blatantly engage in activities that endanger national security. They also intended to incite hatred through smear and slander against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR. We therefore have taken such measures to make a significant impact.""

 The Police remind members of the public that, except under the authority of a licence granted by the Secretary for Security, any person, whether directly or indirectly, making available any funds or other financial assets or economic resources to a relevant absconder (including the provision of funds to online platforms or dedicated pages established by the relevant absconders), or dealing with any funds or other financial assets or economic resources belonging to, or owned or controlled by, a relevant absconder; leasing, or otherwise making available, immovable property to a relevant absconder, or leasing immovable property from a relevant absconder; or establishing a joint venture, partnership or any like relationship with a relevant absconder, or investing in such a joint venture, partnership or any like relationship, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for seven years. The Police will take strict enforcement action against the relevant offences. Members of the public are advised not to break the law.

 The Secretary for Security has instructed the Police to sort out the relevant evidence for him to consider exercising the power under section 60 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance to prohibit the operation of the ""Hong Kong Parliament"" and the ""Hong Kong Democratic Independence Union"" in the HKSAR."

勞工處發言人今日（八月四日）表示，僱主及承建商須盡量避免委派僱員在受暴雨天氣影響的地方進行電力工作（如電弧焊接工作）或處理電力作業裝置，及應參考勞工處出版的《惡劣天氣及「極端情況」下工作守則》和《惡劣天氣下的工作安全指南》。

即使在不受暴雨影響的地方進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置，由於空氣較為潮濕，仍必須採取適當安全措施，以免發生觸電意外。措施包括︰

（一）確保電力系統中所有有關帶電部分已隔離電源，不再帶電，而電源須持續隔離，才可進行電力工作；

（二）進行電力工作或處理電力作業裝置前，先關掉及鎖上電源，再進行測試以確保有關電路已不帶電，並展示適當的警示，最後發出工作許可證；

（三）確保已安裝電力設備或電力作業裝置的保護裝置（例如合適和足夠的熔斷器及斷路器）及保持其效能良好，而手提電工具須為雙重絕緣或具有良好接地裝置；

（四）為僱員提供合適的個人防護裝備，例如絕緣手套及絕緣蓆；及

（五）如不能避免要帶電工作，施工前須由合資格人士進行全面的風險評估，並確保適當的安全措施得以遵守，以消除或妥善控制有關的電力危險。

"Employers, contractors and employees should be aware of electrical safety at work during rainstorms",2025-08-04 06:31,2025-08-04 06:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/04/P2025080400133.htm,"  As the rainstorm warning has been issued by the Hong Kong Observatory, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and contractors that they should adopt necessary work arrangements and take suitable safety measures to protect the safety of their employees when they are carrying out electrical work or handling electrical plant.

  A spokesman for the LD said today (August 4) that employers and contractors should avoid assigning employees to carry out electrical work (such as electric arc welding work) or handle electrical plant at places affected by rainstorms, and should refer to the ""Code of Practice in Times of Adverse Weather and 'Extreme Conditions'"" and the ""Guide on Safety at Work in times of Inclement Weather"" issued by the LD.

  Even if electrical work is carried out or electrical plant is handled at places not affected by a rainstorm, suitable safety measures must still be adopted to prevent an electric shock as the air would be more humid. Such measures include:

(i) Ensure that all live parts of an electrical installation are isolated from the power supply source and rendered dead, and the isolation from the power supply source must be maintained as long as electrical work is being carried out;

(ii) Before carrying out any electrical work or handling any electrical plant, cut off and lock out the power supply source, then test the circuit concerned to confirm that it is dead and display suitable warning notices, and issue a work permit thereafter;

(iii) Ensure that protective devices (such as suitable and adequate fuses and circuit breakers) for the electrical installations or electrical plant have been installed and maintained in good working order, and portable electric tools must be double-insulated or properly earthed;

(iv) Provide suitable personal protective equipment such as insulating gloves and insulating mats for employees; and

(v) If live electrical work is unavoidable, a comprehensive risk assessment should be conducted by a competent person and the appropriate safety precautions should be taken to remove or properly control the electrical hazards involved before such work can proceed.

  In addition, employees should co-operate with the employer or contractor to follow the safety instructions and use the safety equipment provided.

  The LD has published guidebooks and leaflets on electrical work safety. These safety publications are available free from divisional offices of the department or can be downloaded from its website (www.labour.gov.hk/eng/public/content2_8.htm).

  Should there be any questions about occupational safety and health matters, please contact the Occupational Safety Officer of the LD at 2559 2297."

The second case also involved a non-local male passenger who arrived in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, a total of about 10kg of suspected cannabis buds were seized in the check-in suitcase of the 48-year-old male passenger. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested persons of the first and second case have each been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The cases will be brought up at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court tomorrow (August 4).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

新一輪禁毒宣傳展示禁毒新「型」態（附圖）,2025-08-03 19:15,2025-08-03 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300326.htm,"保安局禁毒處舉辦的宣傳活動「禁毒新『型』態」今日（八月三日）下午在油塘「大本型」商場舉行。保安局局長鄧炳強於活動上，向市民介紹新一輪禁毒宣傳的理念，以及撕破「太空油毒品」的假面具，將之正名為依托咪酯。

鄧炳強說，很多人誤以為吸食依托咪酯好「有型」。他要告訴大家，吸毒絕對不「有型」，懂得拒毒才是「有型」！

他表示，毒販刻意美化含有依托咪酯的毒品，藉以誘騙年輕人吸食，令他們忽視這新興毒品對身心的嚴重損害。因此，政府已將這毒品正名為依托咪酯，直接凸顯其毒品的本質。

於活動上，鄧炳強聯同禁毒常務委員會（禁常會）主席李國棟醫生、保安局常任秘書長李百全、保安局副局長卓孝業、署理禁毒專員陳婉嫻和禁常會禁毒教育及宣傳小組委員會主席吳守基主禮，為新一輪的禁毒宣傳揭開序幕。

鄧炳強先帶領署理禁毒專員，撕下道具上印有「太空油毒品」的貼紙，寓意撕破其假面具。鄧炳強隨即聯同其他主禮嘉賓，將印有「依托咪酯」的道具掉入一個有火焰影像的裝置，象徵銷毀依托咪酯這害人不淺的新興毒品。

為進一步宣傳毒品的禍害，禁毒處特意邀請了著名藝人郭富城擔任「榮譽禁毒專員」，並向他頒發委任狀。郭富城更親自創作加入個人特色的特別版禁毒口號「聽我講：企硬唔take嘢！」及禁毒新舞步。活動中，他帶領現場觀眾一起宣讀此特別版禁毒口號及展示禁毒新舞步，展現「向毒品說不」的力量和決心。

郭富城亦即場教授約50位今日獲委任為「青年校園禁毒大使」的年輕人他的禁毒新舞步。「青年校園禁毒大使」將肩負到全港校園宣揚禁毒信息的使命，以將禁毒精神帶入校園。

為讓公眾清楚了解依托咪酯的禍害，例如吸食者會全身抽搐、神志不清、皮膚潰爛、身體不受控等類似「喪屍」的狀態，令吸食者的醜態盡露，尊嚴掃地，成為人生中難以磨滅的污點。新一輪宣傳以「依托咪酯──食咗變喪屍！死咗無人知！」為主題，相關的政府電視宣傳短片及宣傳聲帶已於各電視台及電台播放。有關廣告和宣傳品亦會於公共交通網絡、大型戶外廣告位、戲院、公共屋邨、私人屋苑、社區客廳和新界鄉村等地方展示，亦會於受歡迎的流動應用程式及網站推送給手機用戶。有關依托咪酯的資料已上載保安局禁毒處的專題網頁（www.nd.gov.hk/tc/etomidate.html）供大眾參考。

而警方增設的打擊依托咪酯24小時舉報熱線（號碼：6629 2966）亦已投入運作，以與市民一起合作打擊依托咪酯相關罪行。另外，市民亦可透過即時通訊程式WhatsApp（號碼：6629 2966）或微信（帳戶：eto-report）作出舉報。

今日的宣傳活動亦包括分享環節，由醫院管理局香港中毒控制中心顧問張耀君醫生向觀眾講解依托咪酯的毒害，以及由專業舞台劇演員上演的禁毒互動小劇場，透過生動有趣的手法，宣揚遠離依托咪酯的信息。"
"""Anti-Drug, New Era"" showcased in new anti-drug publicity campaign (with photos)",2025-08-03 19:15,2025-08-03 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300400.htm,"  The publicity event ""Anti-Drug, New Era"" organised by the Narcotics Division (ND) of the Security Bureau was held at the Domain shopping mall in Yau Tong this afternoon (August 3). The Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, introduced the concept of a new anti-drug publicity campaign to members of the public at the event, and talked about tearing down the facade of ""space oil drug"" and renaming it as etomidate.

  Mr Tang said that many people have mistakenly believed that vaping etomidate is ""cool"". He wanted to tell members of the public that drug abuse is definitely not ""cool"". Knowing how to say no to drugs is ""cool""!

  He said that drug traffickers had deliberately glorified etomidate-filled drugs, in order to lure youngsters into taking them and ignoring the serious harmful effects this type of emerging drugs posed to their physical and mental health. The Government has therefore renamed the drugs as ""etomidate"" to state clearly their nature as dangerous drugs.

  MrTang, together with the Chairman of the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN), Dr Donald Li; the Permanent Secretary for Security, Mr Patrick Li; the Under Secretary for Security, Mr Michael Cheuk; the Acting Commissioner for Narcotics, Ms Jenny Chan; and the Chairman of the ACAN Subâcommittee on Preventive Education and Publicity, Mr Wilfred Ng, officiated at the event to launch the new anti-drug publicity campaign.

  MrTang first led the Acting Commissioner for Narcotics to tear off a sticker printed with ""space oil drug"" on a prop, symbolising the tearing down of its facade. Together with other officiating guests, Mr Tang then placed the prop printed with ""etomidate"" into a device with simulated flames, symbolising disposing of this harmful emerging drug, etomidate.

  To further raise awareness about the harmful effects caused by drugs, the ND has especially invited renowned artiste Aaron Kwok to take on the role of ""Honorary Commissioner for Narcotics"", and Aaron Kwok was presented with an appointment certificate. Aaron Kwok has designed a special edition of anti-drug slogan with his personal style: ""Hear me out: Stand Firm. Knock Drugs Out!"" as well as new anti-drug dance moves. At the event, he led the audience to chant this special edition of anti-drug slogan and demonstrated the new anti-drug dance moves, showcasing the strength and determination to ""Say No To Drugs"".

  Aaron Kwok also taught about 50 youngsters, who were appointed as ""School Anti-drug Youth Ambassadors"", his new anti-drug dance moves on the spot today. The ""School Anti-drug Youth Ambassadors"" will undertake the mission to spread anti-drug messages in schools across Hong Kong, bringing an anti-drug spirit to campuses.

  The new publicity campaign aims to give members of the public a clear understanding of the harmful effects caused by etomidate, which include ""zombie-like"" symptoms such as seizures, mental confusion, skin ulcers and loss of body control. Being in this terrible state in public strips abusers of all dignity, and their lives could be tainted. The new publicity campaign is on the theme ""Etomidate - Don't vape it or you'll die like a zombie!"", its relevant Government's TV and radio Announcements in the Public Interest (APIs) have been launched on various television and radio channels. In addition, the relevant advertisements and publicity materials will also be displayed on public transport networks, large outdoor advertising spaces, cinemas, public housing estates, private housing estates, Community Living Rooms and villages in the New Territories, etc. The advertisements will also be pushed to mobile phone users on popular mobile application websites. Information about etomidate has been uploaded onto the dedicated webpage of the ND of the SB (www.nd.gov.hk/en/etomidate.html) for reference by the public.

  To combat etomidate-related crimes with members of the public together, the Police have set up a 24-hour etomidate reporting hotline (number: 6629 2966), which is now in operation. Members of the public can also file reports via the instant messaging applications WhatsApp (number: 6629 2966) and WeChat (account: eto-report).

  The publicity event today also featured a sharing session, in which the Consultant of the Hong Kong Poison Control Centre of the Hospital Authority, Dr Chong Yeow Kuan, explained to the audience the harmful effects caused by etomidate. Professional theatre actors also performed an interactive anti-drug drama to promote the message of staying away from etomidate in a lively and engaging way."

衞生防護中心公布今日沒有新增基孔肯雅熱個案,2025-08-03 17:30,2025-08-03 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300603.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月三日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。市民不論在本地或外遊，均應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

本港今年累計錄得一宗基孔肯雅熱個案，屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

中心今日再次就基孔肯雅熱去信全港醫生和醫院，以提供最新流行病學資訊，並呼籲他們留意從受影響地區外遊回港的求診人士是否有基孔肯雅熱相關病徵。如發現懷疑病例，應即時轉介病人入院治理，並按既定機制向衞生署呈報，以展開流行病學調查及防控工作。此外，對於出現基孔肯雅熱典型臨床症狀的患者，不論是否有旅行史，醫生應根據臨床判斷考慮安排檢測。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）已加強確診病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪地點的防蚊滅蚊工作。同時，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

CHP announces no new confirmed chikungunya fever infection cases today,2025-08-03 17:30,2025-08-03 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/03/P2025080300602.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 3) said that no new confirmed chikungunya fever (CF) infection cases had been recorded as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the CF case in recent days. Members of the public are advised to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside of Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

A total of one CF case was recorded in Hong Kong this year, which is an imported case. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

Today, the CHP issued another letter to all doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong regarding CF to provide them with the latest epidemiological information and appeal them to watch out for CF-related symptoms among those who return to Hong Kong from outbound travel to affected areas. If there are suspected CF cases, they should immediately refer the patients to hospitals for treatment and reported to the DH in accordance with the established mechanism so that the DH can initiate epidemiological investigations, and implement prevention and control measures. Moreover, for patients with typical clinical symptoms of CF, irrespective of their travel history, doctors should consider to arrange testing based on clinical judgment.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public that if they return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. Members of the public should closely observe personal health conditions, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrange appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has intensified anti-mosquito measures at the residence of the confirmed patient and the locations visited after the onset of illness. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces as well as removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The latest gravidtrap and density indices for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas are available on the department website at:https://www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Ovitrap_Index_Update.html#.

The CHP will collaborate with the FEHD to hold an online live seminar on its Facebook page on Tuesday (August 5) from 8pm to 8.30pm, to provide information and health advice on preventing mosquito bites and controlling mosquito breeding, as well as addressing related public inquiries. Members of public are welcome to attend.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."
