陳茂波早上在未來投資倡議大會中，出席了由滙豐舉辦的早餐會，並在其爐邊對談環節分享了對香港和中東深化經貿金融關係的展望。

陳茂波指出，在全球地緣經貿格局日趨碎片化的背景下，中國及其他亞洲地區與中東地區的經貿金融關係正持續深化。香港將進一步發揮國際金融中心和國際一流專業服務的獨特優勢，積極助力內地企業「走出去」，佈局產業鏈和供應鏈，以及拓展海外市場；同時，亦為有意進軍內地和亞洲市場的中東企業提供資金和專業服務等支持。此外，憑藉高度國際化的金融體系、多元化的資金渠道，以及創新的融資方案，香港可進一步推動兩地的資金跨境流動，及以基建貸款證券化等創新模式，為基建投資提供靈活多元的融資方案。

陳茂波也表示，香港正加速推動與中東之間的跨境金融與創科產業合作，包括資本市場的互聯互通，例如互掛交易所買賣基金（ETF），以及鼓勵中東企業來港上市。另外在創科方面，香港以及粵港澳大灣區的初創和科技企業亦有不少已落戶中東發展業務。在回答提問時，陳茂波表示香港正加大力度發展人工智能，包括發展人工智能為核心產業，並以人工智能賦能各行各業升級轉型；政府亦帶頭應用人工智能提升效率和服務質素。

陳茂波其後帶同代表團前往沙特國家銀行（Saudi National Bank）訪問，與銀行的高層管理人員座談交流。該銀行是當地規模最大的國有商業銀行。香港代表團成員分別介紹其業務，並表示希望與沙特當地的金融機構、投資者和企業對接，以進入中東市場。陳茂波作總結發言時表示，香港正積極促進與沙特之間雙向的投資和資金流動，特別是支持香港和內地企業在中東投資興業，期望雙方加強合作，拓展更大商機。

下午，陳茂波率領代表團前往數字合作組織（Digital Cooperation Organization）總部，與該組織總幹事Hajar El Haddaoui博士會面。數字合作組織是一個多邊國際組織，總部設於沙特阿拉伯利雅得，旨在促進成員國之間在數字經濟領域的合作與協同發展。該組織目前涵蓋來自中東、亞洲、非洲等多個地區的16個成員國，以及39個來自區外的國家、國際組織和商業機構等的觀察員，其核心任務包括提升數字基礎設施、促進普惠包容的科技創新、加強青年與婦女在科技領域的參與，以及建立有利於數字企業發展的國際合作平台。

會上，代表團成員介紹了其業務重點和未來發展方向。數字合作組織非常歡迎代表團的到訪，並表示希望推動組織成員國的初創和創科企業與代表團加強交流，促進兩地的創科與產業合作。

代表團亦前往阿卜杜勒阿齊茲國王科技城（King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology）旗下的創科孵化平台「The Garage」參訪，深入了解其運作，以及當地政府在培育初創企業方面的政策。雙方亦探討了企業孵化、人才交流及科研等領域的合作。

其後，代表團前往德拉伊耶（Diriyah），考察聯合國教科文組織世界遺產地——阿圖賴夫區（At-Turaif），並深入了解當地城市復興工程「德拉伊耶門計劃」（Diriyah Gate Project）的內容，特別是當地在推動文化遺產保育、城市規劃與旅遊多元化發展方面的整體策略與最新進展。

FS continues to lead delegation to visit Saudi Arabia (with photos/video),2025-10-30 09:00,2025-10-30 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000040.htm,"âThe Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, continued his official visit to Saudi Arabia yesterday (October 29, Riyadh time), leading a delegation to participate in activities of the Future Investment Initiative (FII). During the visit, Mr Chan engaged in in-depth exchanges with local political and business leaders, and visited local innovation and technology institutions, as well as urban planning and conservation projects.

In the morning, Mr Chan attended a breakfast session hosted by HSBC at the FII and took part in a fireside chat, during which he shared his insights on the prospects for strengthening economic, trade and financial ties between Hong Kong and the Middle East.

Mr Chan noted that against the backdrop of increasing global geopolitical and economic fragmentation, economic and financial links between China as well as other parts of Asia and the Middle East continue to deepen. Hong Kong will further leverage its role as an international financial centre and provider of world-class professional services to support Mainland enterprises in going global, expanding their industrial and supply chains, and tapping into overseas markets. At the same time, Hong Kong stands ready to offer capital and professional services to Middle Eastern businesses seeking to enter the Mainland and Asian markets. Furthermore, with its highly internationalised financial system, diversified financing channels, and innovative financial solutions, Hong Kong is well placed to promote cross-border capital flows as well as provide diversified and flexible infrastructure financing models, such as infrastructure loan securitisation.

Mr Chan added that Hong Kong is accelerating cross-border financial and innovation and technology collaboration with the Middle East. This includes enhancing capital market connectivity, such as mutual listing of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and encouraging Middle Eastern businesses to list in Hong Kong. In terms of innovation and technology, a number of start-ups and tech companies from Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area have already established a presence in the Middle East. In response to questions, Mr Chan said Hong Kong is stepping up efforts to develop artificial intelligence (AI), both as a core industry and as an enabler to help upgrade and transform various sectors. The Government is also taking the lead in adopting AI to enhance efficiency and service quality.

Later in the day, Mr Chan and the delegation visited the Saudi National Bank, the largest state-owned commercial bank in the country, and attended a meeting with its senior management. Members of the Hong Kong delegation introduced their respective businesses and conveyed interest in connecting with financial institutions, investors and enterprises in Saudi Arabia in order to explore opportunities in the Middle Eastern market. In the concluding remarks, Mr Chan highlighted Hong Kong's active role in fostering two-way investment and capital flows with Saudi Arabia, particularly in supporting Hong Kong and Chinese Mainland enterprises to invest and establish businesses in the region. He expressed the hope that both sides would enhance co-operation and seize greater business opportunities.

In the afternoon, the delegation visited the headquarters of the Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) and met with its Director-General, Dr Hajar El Haddaoui. The DCO is a multilateral international organisation based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, aimed at fostering co-operation and coordinated development among member states in the digital economy. Currently comprising 16 member countries from the Middle East, Asia and Africa, and 39 observers including non-regional countries, international organisations and business entities, the DCO's core objectives include enhancing digital infrastructure, promoting inclusive and innovative technology, increasing youth and women participation in technology, and establishing international co-operation platforms conducive to the growth of digital enterprises.

During the meeting, members of the delegation outlined their core business areas and future development directions. The DCO warmly welcomed the delegation and expressed interest in facilitating greater exchanges between start-ups and innovation enterprises from its member states and the Hong Kong delegation, with a view to promoting innovation and industrial co-operation between the two sides.

The delegation also visited The Garage, an innovation and technology incubation platform under the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, to gain a deeper understanding of its operations and the local government's policies in nurturing start-ups. Both sides discussed potential collaboration in areas such as incubation, talent exchanges and scientific research.

Subsequently, the delegation visited Diriyah and visited the At-Turaif, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They also learnt more about the Diriyah Gate Project, a major urban revitalisation initiative. The visit provided insights into local strategies and latest developments in heritage conservation, city planning and the diversification of the tourism sector.

In the evening, Mr Chan attended a welcome dinner hosted by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade for Chinese and Saudi business communities.

Mr Chan will continue his visit in Riyadh today (October 30, Riyadh time) before concluding the trip and returning to Hong Kong."
調整基本利率,2025-10-30 08:00,2025-10-30 08:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000138.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局今日（十月三十日）宣布，基本利率根據預設公式定於4.25厘，即時生效。

基本利率是用作計算經貼現窗進行回購交易時適用的貼現率的基礎利率。目前基本利率定於當前的美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的下限加50基點，或隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息的五天移動平均數的平均值，以較高者為準。

因應美國於十月二十九日（美國時間）調低聯邦基金利率的目標區間25基點，當前的美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的下限加50基點是4.25%，而隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息的五天移動平均數的平均值是3.21%，所以根據預設公式，基本利率設定於4.25%。"
Adjustment of Base Rate,2025-10-30 08:00,2025-10-30 08:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000136.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced today (October 30) that the Base Rate has been set at 4.25 per cent with immediate effect according to a pre-set formula.

The Base Rate is the interest rate forming the foundation upon which the Discount Rates for repurchase transactions through the Discount Window are computed. The Base Rate is currently set at either 50 basis points above the lower end of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.

Following the 25-basis point downward adjustment in the target range for the US federal funds rate on October 29 (US time), 50 basis points above the lower end of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate is 4.25 per cent, while the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs is 3.21 per cent. The Base Rate is therefore set at 4.25 per cent according to the pre-set formula."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-29 18:51,2025-10-29 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102900621.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十九日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案，為輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

首宗個案涉及一名35歲女子，住所位於東區。初步調查顯示，她於十月十九日至二十四日到訪印度尼西亞峇里。她於十月二十二日出現皮疹，翌日（十月二十三日）出現關節痛及發燒，並於十月二十七日向私家醫生求診，昨日（十月二十八日）入住東區尤德夫人那打素醫院在無蚊環境下接受治療。病人的一名家居接觸者及與病人同行到峇里的人士，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

另一宗個案涉及一名69歲男子，獨居於觀塘區。初步調查顯示，他於十月二十一日至二十六日獨自到訪廣東省中山市。他於十月二十六日出現發燒及關節痛，昨日入住基督教聯合醫院在無蚊環境下接受治療。

兩名病人的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。由於兩名病人在潛伏期曾分別到訪印度尼西亞及廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並會把個案通報相關衞生部門。

最新監測數據
———————

就日前確診基孔肯雅熱但感染源頭有待確定的55歲女子，病毒基因分析工作仍在進行。

本港今年累計錄得52宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案。撇除上述個案，一宗屬本地個案，50宗屬輸入個案。

此外，由十月二十六日至今日下午五時，中心已透過設於鳳德商場二樓的醫護站及熱線電話為約3 300名居民作評估，當中發現31名出現輕微病徵的市民，中心已安排他們接受抽血檢查，化驗工作正陸續進行，暫時已完成檢驗的樣本全部對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府繼續全方位防控基孔肯雅熱
——————————————

中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

中心明日（十月三十日）晚上八時三十分會舉行第二場網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等。

中心人員和當區關愛隊已向當區約八千戶民居派發問卷及宣傳單張，並會繼續聯絡居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

另外，中心由十月二十六日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及上述的醫護站，每日由上午九時至下午八時運作，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估和解答市民有關基孔肯雅熱的查詢。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Zhongshan of the Guangdong Province alone between October 21 and October 26. He has developed fever and joint pain since October 26, and was admitted to the United Christian Hospital yesterday for treatment in a mosquito-free environment.

Their blood samples tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. They are now in stable condition. Since the two patients stayed in Indonesia and Guangdong Province respectively during their incubation period, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it will report the cases to the relevant health authorities.

Latest surveillance data
-------------------------------

Regarding the confirmed CF case involving a 55-year-old female with source of infection yet to be confirmed, the genome analysis is still under way.

 So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 52 confirmed CF cases. Excluding the abovementioned case, there are one local case and 50 imported cases.

In addition, from October 26 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessment for about 3 300 residents through the health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre and inquiry hotline. Among them, 31 individuals were found to have mild symptoms and they have been arranged to undergo blood tests. Laboratory testing is continuing, so far those samples that have completed testing are all negative for chikungunya virus.

ããSince the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's continuous comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

The CHP will hold the second online live seminar at 8.30pm tomorrow (October 30). Doctors will explain the latest situation of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents.

The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams have distributed questionnaires and promotional leaflets to about 8 000 households in the district, and will continue to contact the residents, disseminate information, and understand and follow up their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and remaining them to be vigilant.

In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and the abovementioned health consultation booth. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily to provide assessment to residents with relevant symptoms and answer enquiries relating to CF.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year and it has been continued. Among which, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, these measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


ããThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

律政司副司長在涉外法治建設進程中律師與仲裁行業發展業務交流會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-29 18:23,2025-10-29 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800576.htm,"​ 以下是律政司副司長張國鈞博士今日（十月二十九日）在珠海國際仲裁院、珠海市司法局及廣東省律師協會主辦的涉外法治建設進程中律師與仲裁行業發展業務交流會的視像致辭：

各位領導、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家下午好。感謝珠海國際仲裁院、珠海市司法局及廣東省律師協會的邀請。雖然今日我未能親身出席交流會，但十分高興可以透過視頻參與其中。

香港的獨特優勢是背靠祖國、聯通世界。香港的仲裁體系，正好體現這一點。根據最新的國際調查，香港獲選為全球第二、亞太區第一受歡迎的仲裁地，充分證明香港獲國際社會高度認可和信賴。香港的《仲裁條例》採納《示範法》（《國際商事仲裁示範法》），與國際接軌，未來我們也會積極研究修訂條例，確保香港的仲裁法律框架與時並進，符合市場的最新需求。

同時，香港與內地多年來在仲裁領域深化合作，也是香港具備獨特優勢的原因。在法律機制對接方面，兩地落實了《仲裁保全安排》（《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》）和《執行安排》（《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的安排》），法律協助貫穿整個仲裁程序，讓當事人可以申請跨境保全，以及跨境執行裁決，更好保障各方的合法利益。

律政司積極推進大灣區涉外法治建設，並樂意貢獻香港的力量，發揮香港獨特的優勢。我們很高興今年二月迎來了規則銜接方面的重大突破，就是「港資港法」與「港資港仲裁」措施的擴展，而珠海也是其中一個試點城市，可以同時適用這兩項措施。

措施的擴展為企業提供了更多選擇，更靈活和更國際化的法律保障，深受商界包括海外商會的歡迎。落地至今，措施已取得顯著成效，有深圳仲裁機構成功處理選擇「港仲裁」的相關案件。期待珠海國際仲裁院以及大灣區內其他持份者，與我們一道積極推廣「港資」措施的應用，我們也十分歡迎各位隨時向律政司反饋意見。

此外，律政司也積極推動建立並落實「灣區標準」，助力灣區建立多元糾紛解決機制。我們正全力爭取在今年年底制定大灣區仲裁員名冊，增強用家的信心。下一步，我們希望與區內法律部門共同推動設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，凝聚區內仲調機構，共同推廣並採用「灣區標準」，促進灣區仲調服務協同發展。

今日的交流會匯聚灣區內業界的領航人物，為大家帶來實務分享，為灣區法治協同注入新動力、新思維。祝願今日交流會圓滿成功。謝謝。"

New licence fee for electric private cars to take effect from November 1,2025-10-29 16:30,2025-10-29 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800336.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (October 29) reminded members of the public that the new licence fee for electric private cars (e-PCs) will take effect from November 1 (Saturday). The new fee structure will apply to newly registered e-PCs while renewal of vehicle licences (VLs) for existing ones will be granted a four-month grace period. Eligible disabled vehicle owners will be offered licence fee concessions.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""Under the new licence fee structure, licence fees will be charged based on the rated power of e-PCs stated on their vehicle registration documents and VLs, and the fee levels will be suitably adjusted. On the one hand, the new licence fee maintains the attractiveness of electric vehicles (EVs) to continue encouraging drivers to switch to EVs to promote environmental protection, while on the other hand, it aligns with the technological advancements and practices in other regions. The licence fee structure and level for other vehicle classes remain unchanged.""

  The new five-tier licence fee structure based on rated power will comprise incremental adjustments in five phases over six years. The annual licence fee (ALF) for e-PCs from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2027 is tabulated as follows:




Rated power of e-PCs (kilowatts) (kW)
ALF from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2027 ($) (Note)


≤75
1,500


>75 to 125
2,000


>125 to 175
2,500


>175 to 225
3,000


>225
5,000


Note:
			
The ALF from March 1, 2027, onwards is set out in the Annex.
The Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Fund Levy is not yet included, i.e. $114 per vehicle for one year and $38 for four months at present.
The fee for a licence for four months is 35 per cent of that for an annual licence, plus an additional fee of $30.






  Under the new licence fee structure, according to the current distribution of licensed e-PCs, the rated power of 99 per cent of them fall within the first, second and third tiers, while the proportions of e-PCs in the fourth and fifth tiers are only 1 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.

Special arrangements for VL renewal during four-month grace period

  Existing e-PC owners should note that, if their VL expires on or before February 28, 2026, and the renewal application is submitted from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2026, the prevailing licence fee structure and levels will apply.

  As for renewal of VLs expiring on or after March 1, 2026, or applications for first or re-issue of VLs submitted on or after November 1, 2025, the new licence fees will apply.

Provision of licence fee concession to eligible disabled e-PC owners

  The Government will offer licence fee concession to eligible disabled e-PC owners pursuant to the policy objective of social integration. If the rated power of such e-PC does not exceed 75 kW, no licence fee will be charged. If it exceeds 75 kW, the ALF will be charged by deducting an amount equal to the prescribed ALF for an e-PC with a rated power of no more than 75 kW from the ALF of its rated power tier. This arrangement will apply to eligible disabled persons who renew VLs expiring on or after March 1, 2026, or submit applications for first or re-issue of VLs on or after November 1, 2025.

  The TD has issued letters to the automotive trades and vehicle dealers concerned to remind them to take note of the implementation of the new licence fee structure. Notices have been displayed at the TD's Licensing Offices to introduce the above arrangements. The TD will also put up messages about the new fee structure through the ""Electronic Driving Licence"" mobile app and the e-Licensing Portal (elicensingportal.td.gov.hk/login).

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's websiteor call the hotline at 2804 2600 for details."

DH appeals to public to deepen their understanding of stroke symptoms and lead healthy lifestyles in support of World Stroke Day,2025-10-29 11:00,2025-10-29 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800596.htm,"In support of World Stroke Day, the Department of Health (DH) today (October 29) appealed to members of the public to deepen their understanding of the causes and symptoms of stroke in order to prevent stroke and seek prompt medical attention as appropriate. The Government long been adopting a life-course health promotion strategy to promote health, including encouraging the public of different age groups and health statuses to adopt a healthy lifestyle encompassing healthy eating, being physically active, and refraining from smoking and alcohol consumption to guard against non-communicable diseases including stroke. Through the Chronic Disease Co-Care (CDCC) Pilot Scheme, the Government actively promotes convenient screening services for diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT), and blood lipid testing to achieve full coverage of the ""three highs"".

  ""Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Globally, one in four adults over the age of 25 will suffer from stroke at some point in their lifetime, and it is not limited to the elderly. Around 60 per cent of strokes occur in individuals under the age of 70, and 16 per cent occur before the age of 50. Stroke is the fourth most common cause of death in Hong Kong, with 2 911 registered deaths (provisional figure) last year. Among them, 7.7 per cent were people aged 55 or below. The theme for World Stroke Day 2025 is 'Every Minute Counts'. Time is critical in treating stroke. The sooner you recognise stroke symptoms in yourself or others, and the sooner the patient receives treatment, the better the outcome,"" said the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection of the DH, Dr Edwin Tsui.

ããMembers of the public should remember the warning signs of stroke and act ""FAST"":

face drooping: asymmetrical facial expressions;
arm weakness: limb weakness on one side of the body;
speech difficulties: difficulties in communicating with others; and
time: call for immediate medical assistance to save lives.


ããDr Tsui reminded the public that up to 80 per cent of strokes can be prevented through adherence to a healthy lifestyle and proper management of risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. According to the Population Health Survey 2020-22, among those with hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia, 41 per cent, 36 per cent and 70 per cent of the patients respectively were not aware of their conditions until attending the health examination provided under the survey.

The Primary Healthcare Commission promotes the Life Course Preventive Care Plan through the District Health Centres/District Health Centre Expresses (collectively referred to as DHCs) and family doctors, enhancing public awareness on self-health management and disease prevention. The Government launched the three-year CDCC Pilot Scheme since 2023, subsidising Hong Kong residents aged 45 and above with no known medical history of DM or HT to pair with family doctors for DM and HT screening services in the private healthcare market. In March this year, the CDCC Pilot Scheme was expanded to cover blood lipid testing, achieving full coverage of the ""three highs"". Participants diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT or hyperlipidaemia after screening can proceed to the treatment phase and will be subsidised by the Government to continue their treatment with a family doctor of their choice, and subject to their health conditions, be provided with prescribed medication, a dedicated nurse clinic and allied health services. The CDCC Pilot Scheme reinforces the ""Family Doctor for All"" concept and expands the community healthcare network through the DHCs as resource hubs.

As of October 8 this year, over 160000 citizens have already enrolled in the CDCC Pilot Scheme. It is expected that the target of having around 200 000 participants during the pilot period can be achieved earlier than expected. Approximately 99 200 participants (i.e. about 60 per cent) have completed the screenings and around 40 000 participants (i.e. about 40 per cent) have been diagnosed with prediabetes, DM, HT or dyslipidaemia, and have proceeded to the treatment phase. For more details of the CDCC Pilot Scheme, members of the public may visit the dedicatedwebsiteof the CDCC Pilot Scheme.

The Government will continue to promote healthy living and work closely with community partners to foster a supportive environment conducive to healthy living. For more information, please visit the Change for Healthwebsiteof the DH."

徐樂堅醫生提醒市民，多達八成的中風案例是可以透過健康生活，妥善管理高血壓、高膽固醇、糖尿病和肥胖等風險因素來預防。根據二○二○至二○二二年度人口健康調查發現，分別有41%、36%和70%的高血壓、糖尿病和高膽固醇血症患者並不知道自己的情況，直到經接受調查提供的體檢後才意識到已患病。

為提升市民的疾病預防意識和自我健康管理能力，基層醫療署透過各地區康健中心／地區康健站（統稱為康健中心）和家庭醫生積極推廣「健康人生計劃」。政府在二○二三年推出為期三年的「慢病共治計劃」，資助45歲或以上未曾確診患有高血壓或糖尿病的香港居民，配對家庭醫生並於私營醫療市場接受糖尿病及高血壓篩查。先導計劃今年三月擴展至提供血脂檢查，做到「三高全覆蓋」。經篩查後被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂的參加者可進入治療階段，在政府資助下由自行選擇的家庭醫生繼續診治，以及按健康狀況獲處方藥物，接受專屬護士診所和專職醫療服務。先導計劃強化「一人一家庭醫生」概念，以康健中心為樞紐，擴闊社區醫療網絡。

截至今年十月八日，已有超過16萬名市民參加「慢病共治計劃」，預料能較預期時間提早達致約20萬名市民參加的目標；約99 200人（接近六成）已完成篩查，其中約40 000人（約四成）被診斷為血糖偏高，或患有糖尿病、高血壓或高血脂，並已進入治療階段。市民如欲了解「慢病共治計劃」詳情，可瀏覽「慢病共治計劃」專題網站。

政府會繼續推動市民奉行健康生活，並會與社區夥伴緊密合作，共同建設一個有利人們健康生活的環境。詳情可瀏覽衞生署「活出健康新方向」網頁。"
