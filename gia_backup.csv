The FEHD is concerned about two survey areas in Kowloon City District where the gravidtrap indexes have exceeded 10%, indicating that the mosquito prevention and control measures in nearby premises need to be strengthened. The FEHD has stepped up inspections and followed up with the persons responsible for the management of relevant premises. Mosquito breeding was found in nearby residential estates and construction sites, along with damaged facilities that led to accumulation of water. As a result, the FEHD instituted a prosecution and issued seven statutory notices to the relevant property management company in accordance with Section 27 of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132), requiring the company's responsible person to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. Two prosecutions and five statutory notices were also issued to the contractors of the relevant construction sites. In addition, the FEHD has visited schools, elderly homes and childcare facilities in the surrounding area to provide mosquito prevention and elimination information. New mosquito traps were installed in the schools to enhance mosquito control efforts. These inspections will continue. According to records, the FEHD has initiated a total of 10 prosecutions against contractors in the survey areas and surrounding construction sites for mosquito breeding over the past six months.

The FEHD will hold interdepartmental meetings with relevant departments and stakeholders to identify locations with higher mosquito infestations and carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also distribute leaflets and posters, and notify residential estates that have subscribed to the gravidtrap Rapid Alert System, advising management agents and residents to stay vigilant and work together on mosquito prevention and elimination measures. In addition, the FEHD will strengthen monitoring of the gravidtrap index in the area to review the effectiveness of the mosquito control work.

The FEHD has so far released seven batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in October 2025, covering 64 survey areas. Among these 64 survey areas, 44 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. September 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Eighteen other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

In response to the recent chikungunya fever (CF) situation, the FEHD has implemented special mechanism to strengthen mosquito control work in areas with a gravidtrap index between 10 per cent and 20 per cent, instead of 20 per cent or above under the original mechanism.

Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD is disseminating the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of CF transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-31 21:15,2025-10-31 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100842.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 31), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded. The confirmed CF case involving a 55-year-old female, with the source of infection yet to be confirmed, is now classified as a locally acquired case.

Latest surveillance data
-------------------------------

The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch has completed genome analysis of the 55-year-old female. The result indicated that the genetic sequence of her viral sample matched with that of first local CF case in Hong Kong (an 82-year-old female living in Fung Tak Estate in Wong Tai Sin), confirming both patients share the same source of infection. Based on the epidemiological information for both patients, including their common locations of movement during the incubation periods, the CHP considered that the 55-year-old female more likely acquired the infection in the vicinity of Fung Tak Estate. As her infection and onset of illness occurred prior to the commencement of the Government's ongoing large-scale mosquito control operations, this locally acquired case will not have significant impact to the overall risk assessment.

The CHP has implemented prevention and control measures according to epidemiological investigations and risk assessment, which include providing medical surveillance and health advice to household contacts of the case or those with common exposure to the source of infection. If they present with relevant symptoms, the CHP will arrange laboratory testing for them.

 So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 52 confirmed CF cases, including two local cases and 50 imported cases.

As of 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessments for about 9 400 residents through the health consultation booth on the second floor of Fung Tak Shopping Centre, its inquiry hotline and door-to-door visits in Fung Tak Estate. Among them, 37 individuals with mild symptoms have been arranged to undergo blood tests. Laboratory testing is continuing. As of 5pm today, 34 samples have completed testing and are all negative for the chikungunya virus.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's continuous comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

Following the classification of the 55-year-old female as a locally acquired case, CHP officers today paid a visit to the school in Fung Tak Estate where she works, to follow up with the school management once again. It was confirmed that no other staff or students had developed relevant symptoms at the moment. The CHP also reiterated hygiene advice to the school on preventing CF.

In addition, the CHP held the secondonline live seminar last night with doctors explaining the latest situation of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents. The seminar attracted over 13 000 total views.

The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams will continue to contact the residents in the district, disseminate information, and understand and follow up on their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and reminding them to be vigilant.

In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and the abovementioned health consultation booth. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily to provide assessments to residents with relevant symptoms and answer enquiries relating to CF.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

ãã
âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

â
âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
ã
The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

食環署關注九龍城區內兩個監察地區的誘蚊器指數高於10%，顯示附近處所的防蚊滅蚊工作需要加強。食環署人員已加強巡查及與相關處所管理人作出跟進，其中發現有附近屋苑及地盤有蚊子滋生，亦有設施損壞導致積水情況，已按香港法例第132章《公眾衞生及市政條例》第27條向屋苑管理公司提出一宗檢控，以及發出七張法定通知書，要求該管理公司負責人必須做好清除蚊子滋生地的工作；亦向相關地盤承辦商分別提出兩宗檢控及發出五張法定通知書。此外，食環署亦到訪附近範圍內的學校、長者院舍和幼兒設施，提供防蚊滅蚊資訊，並在有關學校內設置新型捕蚊器，加強防控蚊患。有關巡查會繼續進行。根據紀錄，在過去半年，食環署在相關監察地區及附近一帶的地盤，就蚊子滋生情況共向地盤承辦商提出10宗檢控。

食環署會舉行跨部門小組會議，聯同有關部門及持份者，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作。食環署亦會派發宣傳單張及海報，並通知各訂閱快速通報系統的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。此外，食環署會加強監察該地區的誘蚊器指數，以檢視滅蚊工作成效。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十月共七批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共64個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年九月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這64個監察區中，44個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有18區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

因應基孔肯雅熱情況，食環署今年實施特別安排，將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時進行的強化控蚊工作，擴展至誘蚊器指數介乎10%至20%的區域。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

These episodes showcase China's major achievements and technological contributions in environmental protection and green development from different perspectives, fostering patriotism among the younger generation and helping them understand the country's ecological civilisation development practices and progress toward building a beautiful China.

In addition, the Environment and Ecology Bureau is producing the documentary series ""Enchanting Hong Kong"" with a total of five episodes. The first episode, ""Picturesque Bays of Hong Kong"", features the magnificent Mirs Bay, vividly showing how the environment in Hong Kong has improved since its return to the motherland, with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government dedicating great efforts to environmental protection and nature conservation, yielding fruitful results. At the event today, an excerpt from the ""The City of Life"" episode of ""Enchanting Hong Kong"" delicately portrayed how the HKSAR Government balances urban vitality and development needs while protecting lush green environments and biodiversity, transforming Hong Kong into a more liveable and sustainable vibrant city. Mr Tse encouraged the participating student representatives to explore more, cherish the ecological miracles of the country and Hong Kong, and join hands to inject new impetus into sustainable development.

Afterwards, Deputy Director of Environmental Protection Dr Vanessa Au hosted the Environmental Education Interactive Session for Students, during which personnel from the Water Quality Management Division of the Environmental Protection Department shared key points on keeping shorelines clean and raising teenagers' environmental awareness. Dr Au then hosted the ""Exploring Beautiful Campuses"" segment in the interactive session, inviting students to share the most charming aspects of their campuses, design tour routes, and introduce highlights related to environmental protection on campuses. She praised how the campuses cleverly integrate green elements to cultivate students' daily habits of cherishing resources and loving the Earth. She then presented certificates to student representatives to encourage them to turn the public day experience into action, share it with families and friends, and contribute to environmental protection in daily life.

The 20th Eco Expo Asia was held from October 28 to 31, with the last day as a public day open to all free of charge. This year's public day programme also included green seminars, green workshops and interactive games."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-31 20:00,2025-10-31 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100770.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月三十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。而早前確診基孔肯雅熱但感染源頭有待確定的55歲女子，會被列作本地感染個案。

最新監測數據
———————

中心的公共衞生化驗服務處已完成對該名55歲女子的基因分析工作。結果顯示，她的病毒樣本基因序列，與本港首宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案（一名居於黃大仙鳳德邨的82歲女子）一樣，顯示兩名患者的感染源頭相同。綜合兩人的流行病學資料，包括她們在潛伏期的共通活動地點，中心認為該名55歲女患者較大機會在鳯德邨一帶受到感染。由於她感染和發病日期在政府展開持續大規模控蚊行動之前，這宗本地感染個案不會對整體的風險評估有太大影響。

中心已按流行病學調查及風險評估進行防控工作，包括為個案的家居接觸者或共同暴露於感染源頭的人士提供醫學監察及健康建議，如他們出現相關病徵，中心會安排化驗檢測。

本港今年累計錄得52宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案。兩宗屬本地個案，50宗屬輸入個案。

截至今日下午五時，中心透過設於鳳德商場二樓的醫護站、熱線電話及於鳳德邨進行上門探訪，已為約9 400名居民作評估，並已安排37名出現輕微病徵的市民接受抽血檢查，化驗工作正陸續進行。截至今日下午五時，中心已完成檢驗34名市民的血液樣本，全部對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府繼續全方位防控基孔肯雅熱
——————————————

中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

因應該名55歲女子被列為本地感染個案，中心今日派員到她任職、位於鳳德邨的學校，再次向校方了解情況，並確認目前校內沒有其他師生出現相關病徵，中心亦再次提醒校方有關預防基孔肯雅熱的衞生建議。

另外，中心昨日晚上舉行第二場的網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等，總觀看人次超過13 000。

中心人員和當區關愛隊會繼續聯絡區內居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

另外，中心由十月二十六日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及上述的醫護站，每日由上午九時至下午八時運作，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估和解答市民有關基孔肯雅熱的查詢。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

A spokesman for the FEHD said today (October 31), ""Starting from September, the FEHD has been stepping up inspections of factories that manufacture ice cream at the wholesale level to ensure that their operations comply with relevant licensing conditions and meet the hygiene standards stipulated in the laws in the handling and production of ice cream. Meanwhile, FEHD staff will also provide health education to operators and staff of frozen confection factories, distributing food safety pamphlets to remind them of the proper way of handling frozen confections.""

Mr Eric Sun (Chairman of the Hong Kong Exporters' Association), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good evening. It is a great pleasure to join you tonight for the 70th anniversary of the Hong Kong Exporters' Association.

  As Eric just said, turning 70 is more than a number. It's a story. A story of resilience and innovation. A story of highs and lows over seven decades.

  You have pursued opportunities around the world. You have believed in the power of trade.

  The Association and its members are at the heart of this success. You have helped make Hong Kong a global centre for business.

   And your hard work has delivered real results. Hong Kong is now a world-leading trade hub. We rank first in global air cargo. We are the world's fourth-largest maritime centre.

   Continual upgrading is essential to any business, industry or sector. And I'm pleased to note that the Association has long encouraged local manufacturers and exporters to transform from ""original equipment manufacturing"" to ""original design manufacturing"" and ""original brand manufacturing"".

  The Association has also been active in promoting an innovative culture in Hong Kong.

  Over the years, the ""Hong Kong Smart Design Awards"" and ""Hong Kong Innovation & Invention"", organised by the Association, have brought Hong Kong original designs and I&T products to the international stage. Your goal - helping build Hong Kong into the region's most influential design force - is making a decided difference.

  The Association works closely with the Government, and we're working together to promote industrial and economic diversification - and Hong Kong's high-value-added development.

  Globally, we see challenges. We see tariffs, growing unilateralism and uncertainties.

  But Hong Kong's economy remains steady. Our economy has recorded positive growth for 10 consecutive quarters since 2023, with a year-on-year growth of 3.1 per cent in the second quarter. And our exports have grown for 19 months in a row.

  Ladies and gentlemen, your determined and continuing efforts, together with our country's full support, are showing encouraging results.

  The momentum of our import and export sectors is expected to continue to strengthen. And you can count on the Government to help you, our exporters, and every sector and industry of our economy, in seizing the opportunities on the Mainland and in markets throughout the region and around the world.

  Allow me now, for a moment, to speak about the upcoming Legislative Council election. A strong partnership between the Government and the legislature is key to building a better Hong Kong, and that partnership begins with your vote. I therefore encourage every registered voter here to support this important election and cast your vote on December 7.

  Once again, my warmest congratulations to the Hong Kong Exporters' Association on 70 remarkable years. I know you will enjoy this very special evening. And I look forward to working with you in the coming year and long down the export road.

  Thank you."

15 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-10-31 19:15,2025-10-31 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100691.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Contribute"", joint operations with the Hong Kong Police Force codenamed ""Champion"" and ""Windsand"", and a joint operation with the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department codenamed ""Flabbergast"" from October 24 to yesterday (October 30). A total of 13 suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested.

  During the anti-illegal worker operations, ImmD officers raided multiple target locations including restaurants and renovation flats etc. Thirteen suspected illegal workers and two suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised 11 men and two women, aged 27 to 58. A man and a woman, aged 36 and 56, were suspected of employing the illegal workers and were also arrested.

  An investigation into the suspected employers is ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years.""

  The spokesman stressed that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately.

  For reporting illegal employment activities, please call the dedicated hotline 3861 5000, by fax at 2824 1166, email to anti_crime@immd.gov.hk, or submit ""Online Reporting of Immigration Offences"" form at www.immd.gov.hk."
反非法勞工行動拘十五人（附圖）,2025-10-31 19:15,2025-10-31 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100688.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月二十四日至昨日（十月三十日）在全港多區展開一系列反非法勞工行動，包括「促進行動」、聯同香港警務處執行的「冠軍行動」及「風沙行動」，以及聯同食物及環境衛生署及康樂及文化事務署執行的「驚愕行動」。截至昨日（十月三十日），行動中共拘捕十三名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

反非法勞工行動中，調查人員搜查了多個目標地點，包括餐廳及裝修中單位等，共拘捕十三名懷疑非法勞工及兩名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為十一男兩女，年齡介乎二十七至五十八歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一男一女，年齡分別為三十六及五十六歲。

有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。」

發言人強調，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"

尊敬的陳旭主任（國務院僑務辦公室主任）、劉光源副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝署理特派員（中華人民共和國外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署署理特派員）、蔡冠深會長（香港中華總商會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！今天晚上我很高興出席香港中華總商會125周年會慶晚宴。

中總自從一九○○年成立以來，一直積極推動香港工商業發展和社會進步，見證並參與了香港每一個重要的發展階段。

中總多年來努力不懈，帶領企業不斷創新、拓展機遇，為香港的繁榮穩定，作出了重要貢獻。

作為香港最有影響力的商會之一，中總不僅為企業提供一個優秀的交流平台，更成為香港與內地、乃至國際貿易合作中一個重要的橋樑。

香港憑著「一國兩制」的獨特優勢，一直積極擔當「超級聯繫人」的角色，深化國際交往，發揮內聯外通的功能，吸引越來越多內地和國際企業，借助香港這個平台「走出去」，為本地企業創造更多商機和經濟回報。

現在，內地企業出海步伐明顯加快。不少內地企業希望通過香港進行融資、設立國際總部、財資中心、科研基地，以至供應鏈管理中心等，進一步拓展全球布局。

為進一步支援內地企業經香港出海，我們已經於今月初整合香港的外地辦事處，包括投資推廣署、香港貿易發展局和香港駐內地辦事處，組成一站式平台，成立內地企業出海專班，吸引更多企業選擇香港作為拓展海外業務的首選平台。

在國家的堅實支持下，本屆政府持續推進改革，實施多項發展經濟、改善民生的政策措施。香港在多項國際排名中名列前茅，顯示我們持續保持經濟活力，也反映國際社會對香港的信心和認可。

展望未來，我們將繼續鞏固香港的固有優勢，並發掘新增長點，加快發展北部都會區和建設國際創新科技中心，更好融入國家發展大局。

好像剛才蔡會長所說，立法會換屆選舉將於十二月七日舉行。自從二○二一年完善選舉制度以來，香港治理體系更加完善，行政立法高效協作，經濟發展動力不斷增強。

我呼籲中總以及在座各位朋友，全力支持立法會選舉，在十二月七日踴躍投票，讓我們一起選出代表我們的賢能之士，齊心推動經濟發展、改善民生，共建更美好的香港。

我也期望中總與特區政府繼續攜手合作，共同推動本地工商界發展，促進香港繁榮穩定。

最後，我要特別感謝中總贊助今年十月的國慶煙花匯演，讓廣大市民和遊客共享喜悅。在此，我也祝賀中總成立125周年，並祝願中總發展更上一層樓，各位工作順利、身體健康。謝謝大家。"

今年為國際環保博覽的二十周年，國際培訓班為重點活動之一，旨在提升「一帶一路」國家環境技術能力，促進「一帶一路」倡議下的國際環保交流與合作。六個來港出席國際環保博覽的「一帶一路」國家（包括阿拉伯聯合酋長國、老撾、柬埔寨、孟加拉國、哈薩克斯坦和斯里蘭卡）的環保領域高級別官員，應邀參加十月二十九日至十一月一日在湖南省長沙市舉行的國際培訓班。

環保署署長徐浩光博士今日（十月三十一日）在湖南長沙出席了國際培訓班活動，並在上午舉行的中國科學院水與環境卓越中心技術研討會上致辭。

徐浩光博士表示：「依託中國科學院的強大科研實力，結合香港在環境保護領域的獨特優勢與豐富經驗，雙方的合作能產生強大的協同效應，進一步推動『一帶一路』國際綠色合作。這次培訓班意義深遠，標誌着環保署與中科院首次在內地共同為『一帶一路』國家的高級官員舉辦技術研討與實地考察，雙方合作邁上新台階，亦為明年開幕的『一帶一路』可持續綠色發展培訓中心奠定基礎。」

Green Silk Road International Training Program promotes green development co-operation among Belt and Road countries (with photos),2025-10-31 18:53,2025-10-31 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100503.htm,"âThe Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and the Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) jointly organised the first Green Silk Road International Training Program on Environmental Technologies and Sustainable Development (International Training Program), inviting senior environmental officials from Belt and Road (B&R) countries to participate, with an aim to promote exchanges and collaboration on sustainable green development.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of Eco Expo Asia, with the International Training Program featured as one of the key events. The program aims to to enhance environmental technology capacities in B&R countries and foster international environmental exchanges and co-operation under the B&R Initiative. Senior environmental officials from six B&R countries (namely the United Arab Emirates, Laos, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan and Sri Lanka) who attended Eco Expo Asia in Hong Kong have been invited to participate in a training held in Changsha, Hunan Province, from October 29 to November 1.

The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, today (October 31) attended the training events in Changsha and delivered a speech at the technical seminar of the CAS Centre of Excellence for Water and Environment held in the morning.

  ""Leveraging the Chinese Academy of Sciences' strength of scientific research and combining Hong Kong's unique advantages and extensive experience in environmental protection, the mutual co-operation can generate powerful synergistic effects and further advance international green co-operation under the B&R Initiative. This training program is highly significant, marking the first joint technical seminar and field visit organised by the EPD and the CAS on the Mainland for senior officials from B&R countries. It represents a new level of co-operation between both parties and provides a foundation for the B&R sustainable green development training centre to be set up next year,"" Dr Chui said.

The International Training Program yesterday (October 30) arranged visits to several leading green companies and facilities in Hunan, providing the delegation with insights into the latest technologies and achievements in the environmental protection sector of the Mainland. They also visited the Smart Water Quality Monitoring Station at the Changsha Monkey Stone Water Treatment Plant and an integrated rural sewage treatment facility in Changsha.

In addition to the training program in Changsha, the EPD held a three-day Technical Training Experience Program in Hong Kong during Eco Expo Asia. Through a series of seminars, meetings and site visits, the program shared Hong Kong's experiences in environmental protection and climate change adaptation with representatives from B&R countries. On the first day (October 28), the EPD cohosted a seminar on climate change strategies and actions with the Civil Engineering and Development Department. On the second day (October 29), delegates took a ride on the electric ferry ""Hong Kong Water Taxi 28"" for a tour of Victoria Harbour. While enjoying the cityscape, they learned about Hong Kong's latest developments in green transportation and air quality management. On the third day (October 30), they paid a visit to the Tai Po Kau Tide Gauge Station to learn about Hong Kong's infrastructure for addressing climate change and extreme weather. Moreover, they visited the EcoPark in Tuen Mun to learn about the circular economy, waste recycling, and reuse technologies, and toured the EPD's waste-to-energy facility T·PARK.

In addition, on the second day of Eco Expo Asia (October 29), the EPD jointly organised the Experience Sharing Forum on Promoting Environmental Business in Oversees Market with the RCEES of the CAS. Representatives from the United Arab Emirates, Cambodia, and Kazakhstan introduced policies, regulations, and preferential measures to attract foreign environmental companies' investment. Several Mainland companies also shared their successful experiences in going global. The exchange provided useful information for Hong Kong's environmental industry to expand to overseas markets and encouraged the Mainland enterprises to leverage Hong Kong's business advantages to seek international development opportunities for ""go global"" strategies.

Dr Chui concluded that the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will continue to fully utilise Hong Kong's experience and advantages in environmental protection and infrastructure to assist B&R countries in achieving high-quality and sustainable green development. The EPD will co-ordinate with the RCEES of the CAS's expertise in green technology development and industry connections on the Mainland to actively organise the Green Silk Road International Training Programs in order to promote international exchanges and co-operation on green B&R initiatives and assist high-quality Mainland green enterprises to expand to overseas markets."
"Another new drug approved under ""1+"" mechanism",2025-10-31 18:35,2025-10-31 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100638.htm,"A Government spokesman announced today (October 31) that one more new drug submitted for registration under the new drug approval mechanism (""1+"" mechanism) has been approved for registration in Hong Kong. This new drug is used to reduce proteinuria in patients with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy, bringing more treatment options for patients. The Government continues to strive to accelerate the introduction of innovative drugs and medical devices so that patients can gain early access to advanced diagnoses and treatments, while developing Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub.

New drug approved
----------------------

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has implemented the ""1+"" mechanism since November 1, 2023, to facilitate the registration of new drugs used for the treatment of life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases in Hong Kong. With effect from November 1 last year, the ""1+"" mechanism has been extended to all new drugs, including all new chemical or biological entities and new indications, and vaccines and advanced therapy products. New drugs that are supported by local clinical data and recognised by local experts can be applied for registration in Hong Kong by submitting approval from one reference drug regulatory authority (instead of two in the past).

The above product has been approved by the drug regulatory authority in the United States and submitted for registration applications under the ""1+"" mechanism. Having evaluated the clinical data and relevant information submitted by the applicant and advice given by local expert, the Registration Committee under the Pharmacy and Poisons Board of Hong Kong considered that the new drug satisfied the criteria of safety, efficacy and quality, and approved the registration of the new drug. The Department of Health (DH) has already notified the applicant of the result of the application. The HKSAR Government will also complete the relevant registration processes in accordance with established procedures.

Paving the way towards primary evaluation
-------------------------------------------------

Since the implementation of the ""1+"" mechanism, a total of 15 new drugs, including the above drug, have been approved under this mechanism. Seven of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary. The DH has been promoting the ""1+"" mechanism through different channels and so far has received more than 630 enquiries from over 160 pharmaceutical companies, including those from overseas and the Mainland. Many companies have expressed interest in submitting applications for registration of their products, including advanced therapy products, under the extended ""1+"" mechanism. Since the launch of the pre-new drug application consultation service in March this year, the DH has already held a number of briefing seminars and workshops. The DH will also have pre-new drug application meetings to be rolled out in the fourth quarter of this year, to enhance the efficiency in processing relevant applications.

  ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"" announced that the Government will accelerate the reform of the regulatory system of drugs and medical devices, thereby consolidating Hong Kong's position as an international health and medical innovation hub. The DH will expedite the ""1+"" mechanism for new drugs, piloting priority evaluation and approval of innovative drugs as recommended by the Hospital Authority for treatment of severe or rare diseases and to accelerate patients' use of the advanced treatments. The DH will establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of next year, and implement ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration in phases beginning next year. The DH will continue to proactively advance preparatory work for ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration and progressively establish a robust approval system, providing strong momentum for the development and market expansion of the healthcare industry in the HKSAR, the Mainland, and beyond, thereby transforming Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub."
HA announces application arrangements under enhanced medical fee waiving mechanism,2025-10-31 18:30,2025-10-31 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100494.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

  The Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (October 31) the application arrangements under the enhanced medical fee waiving mechanism. Patients with appointments at public hospitals next year can submit advance applications for medical fee waivers in phases starting from November 2025. Additionally, the HA will implement special transitional arrangements from January to March next year to facilitate applications from persons in need. The HA has established dedicated teams to assist patients with fee waiver applications.

  AnHA spokesperson said, ""As the public healthcare fees and charges reform takes effect on January 1 next year, the HA will simultaneously introduce a series of strengthened protection measures, including enhancing the current medical fee waiver mechanism, which will increase the number of eligible beneficiaries from 300 000 to 1.4 million.""

  To handle the additional fee waiver applications, the HA will implement special transitional arrangements during the transition period from January to March next year to ensure timely processing of applications:


Patients with appointments at public hospitals in January or February next year can submit required documentation two months in advance (i.e.in November or December 2025). Applications will be pre-assessed, and eligible patients will receive medical fee waiver certificates before their follow-up appointments after the Reform takes effect on January 1; and
Patients requiring immediate or urgent treatment, who cannot afford medical expenses at the public sector but cannot provide complete documentation for financial assessment, will be granted ""conditional waivers""for full or partial medical fees. Eligible patients need only submit relevant documents within three months to receive official medical fee waiver certificates upon passing the assessment.


  Meanwhile, patients currently holding medical fee waiver certificates (full or partial) can continue using them until expiry without reapplication. Patients with partial fee waiver certificates who qualify for full waivers under the enhanced mechanism can obtain full waivers by declaring no significant change in financial status at Medical Social Services Units (MSSU) three months before appointments or within three months after hospitalisation, without requiring reassessment. The validity will be the same as the original certificate's expiry date.

  As an important part of the public healthcare fees and charges reform, the medical fee waiver thresholds will be relaxed from January 1 next year. The income limit will be raised to 100 per cent of the median monthly household income (MMDHI) (for households with two or more persons) or 150 per cent of MMDHI (for single-person households), while the asset limit will be relaxed to that of the public rental housing application. Furthermore, the application procedures and coverage will be enhanced to facilitate public access, including relaxing the definition of ""household"" so that family members without close financial ties to the applicant may be excluded from means testing; expanding the coverage of periodic medical fee waivers to include episodic Family Medicine Out-patient Services; extending the maximum waiver validity period from 12 months to 18 months; and allowing patients to simply sign a declaration confirming unchanged financial status for reapplication within 18 months without resubmitting financial documents.

  Patients can apply for medical fee waivers at MSSU in public hospitals or clinics, as well as the Social Welfare Department's Integrated Family Service Centres, Family and Child Protective Services Units, or other designated service units. Members of the public can also learn about application procedures through the HA's mobile application ""HA Go"" by accessing the ""Medical Fee Assistance Domain"" and preliminarily assess their eligibility through the Means Test Calculator (applicable for applications from January 1, 2026) via ""HA Go"" or the HA website(ewsecal.ha.org.hk/calculator/index.html?lang=en).

  The HA will utilise confirmed means test eligibility under social welfare and other government-subsidised schemes as a reference for processing fee waiver applications, aiming to make arrangements and procedures as clear and simple as possible for the public. The HA will also gradually digitalise the assessment process, allowing applicants to check application status and upload documents through the HA Go mobile application by the end of this year, with the goal of enabling online applications by the third quarter of next year.

  The spokesperson added, ""The HA has established dedicated teams starting from November to ensure timely processing of medical fee waiver applications received by all public hospitals.""

  Additionally, after the public healthcare fees and charges reform takes effect in January next year, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals will continue its mission of providing free outpatient services to those in need. Eligible persons seeking outpatient services at Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, Tung Wah Hospital, and Kwong Wah Hospital will continue to be exempted from the following fees:


Attendance and prescription fees at Family Medicine Clinics (excluding integrated clinics) (applicable to all Eligible Persons)
Attendance fee at Specialist Outpatient Clinics (excluding integrated clinics and allied health clinics) (applicable only to Eligible Persons aged 75 or above, or aged 12 or below)


  Furthermore, the HA has gazetted today the fee revisions for Non-eligible Persons, non-subsidised services at public hospitals, and remaining items of public healthcare services, which will take effect from January 1, 2026. Charges for Non-eligible Persons will be adjusted based on the 2023-24 service cost levels, while fees for non-subsidised services will be adjusted based on cost recovery principles, with reference to market rates. These services will not be subsidised by public funding. The HA will also adjust certain hospital administrative fees (such as certificates and medical reports, photocopying charges, and mortuary). The HA's new fee arrangements are listed in the Annex."

The results of about 6 600 food samples tested (including food items purchased online) were found to be satisfactory except for six unsatisfactory samples that were announced earlier. The overall satisfactory rate was 99.9 per cent.

A CFS spokesman said that about 1 900 food samples were collected for microbiological tests, and about 4 700 samples were taken for chemical and radiation level tests.

The microbiological tests covered pathogens and hygiene indicators; the chemical tests included testing for pesticides, preservatives, metallic contaminants, colouring matters, veterinary drug residues and others; and the radiation-level tests included testing for radioactive caesium and iodine in samples collected from imported food from different regions.

The samples comprised about 1 900 samples of vegetables and fruit and their products; about 500 samples of cereals, grains and their products; about 900 samples of meat and poultry and their products; about 900 samples of milk, milk products and frozen confections; about 800 samples of aquatic and related products; and about 1 600 samples of other food commodities (including beverages, bakery products and snacks).

The six unsatisfactory samples comprised a prepackaged dried porcini sample and a prepackaged black grouper fillet sample detected with metallic contaminants exceeding the legal limit, two dessert samples and a prepackaged shrimp noodle sample detected with preservatives exceeding the legal limit, and a chicken rice sample found to contain Salmonella.

The CFS has taken follow-up actions on the above-mentioned unsatisfactory samples, including informing the vendors concerned of the test results, instructing them to stop selling the affected food items, and tracing the sources of the food items in question, and etc.

The spokesman reminded the food trade to ensure that food is fit for human consumption and meets legal requirements. Consumers should patronise reliable shops when buying food and maintain a balanced diet to minimise food risks.

Separately, in response to the Japanese Government's discharge of nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the CFS will continue enhancing the testing on imported Japanese food, and make reference to the risk assessment results to adjust relevant surveillance work in a timely manner. The CFS will announce every working day on its dedicated webpage (www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/daily_japan_nuclear_incidents.html) the radiological test results of the samples of food imported from Japan, with a view to enabling the trade and members of the public to have a better grasp of the latest safety information."

再多一款新藥在「1+」機制下獲批,2025-10-31 17:23,2025-10-31 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100630.htm,"政府發言人今日（十月三十一日）表示，再有一款新藥在「1+」藥物審批機制下獲批准在港註冊。該款藥物用於減少原發性免疫球蛋白A腎病的蛋白尿，能為病患者帶來更多醫治選擇。政府會繼續致力加快引入創新藥械，讓病人盡早獲得先進診療，同時推動香港成為國際醫療創新樞紐。

新藥獲批
————

香港特別行政區（特區）於二○二三年十一月一日起實施「1+」機制，便利用以治療嚴重或罕見疾病的新藥來港註冊，並已於去年十一月一日起將「1+」機制擴展至所有新藥，包括任何含新藥劑或生物元素成分的製品及藥物新適應症、疫苗以至先進療法製品。新藥若能提供符合要求的本地臨床數據，並經本地專家認可後，只須提交一個（而非原來的兩個）參考藥物監管機構，便可以在香港申請註冊。

上述新藥已獲美國的藥物監管機構批核，並在「1+」機制下提交註冊申請。香港藥劑業及毒藥管理局轄下的註冊委員會在對申請人提交的臨床數據及相關資料作出審評及經徵詢本地專家的意見後，認為該款新藥符合相關安全、效能及素質標準，批准在香港註冊。衞生署已通知申請人有關審批結果，特區政府亦會按既定程序完成相關註冊程序。

有序邁向「第一層審批」
———————————

自「1+」機制生效以來，連同上述新藥，現時共有十五款新藥按此機制獲批准註冊，其中七款新藥已獲納入醫院管理局藥物名冊。衞生署一直積極透過不同渠道宣傳「1+」機制，至今已收到160多間藥廠超過630個查詢，當中包括海外及內地藥廠。不少公司已表示有興趣在擴展的「1+」機制下為包括先進療法製品的藥物提交註冊申請。衞生署亦已推出「1+」新藥註冊申請前會面諮詢服務，於今年三月起先後舉辦多場簡介講座及新藥註冊工作坊，並計劃在今年第四季推出申請前諮詢會議，以提升處理相關申請的效率。

《行政長官2025年施政報告》公布特區政府會提速落實支持藥械的制度改革工作，鞏固香港作為國際醫療創新樞紐的地位。衞生署會加快「1+」新藥審批機制，試行優先審批經醫院管理局建議能應對治療嚴重或罕見疾病的創新藥，加快病人使用最先進治療。衞生署亦將於二○二六年內成立「香港藥物及醫療器械監督管理中心」；以及於二○二六年開始分階段實施「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制。為此，衞生署會繼續積極推進「第一層審批」新藥註冊機制的準備工作，並逐步建立完善的審批制度，為香港特區以至國家及其他地區的醫療健康產業發展和市場拓展注入強大動力，將香港打造為國際醫療創新樞紐。"
Speech by SJ at YBC Conference 2025: The Art of Regulation (English only) (with photo),2025-10-31 17:22,2025-10-31 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100622.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the YBC Conference 2025: The Art of Regulation today (October 31):

Mr José Antonio Maurellet, SC (Chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association), dear friends, distinguished guests, esteemed colleagues and young barristers, ladies and gentlemen,

  A very good afternoon. It is my honour to stand before you today at the Conference organised by the Standing Committee on Young Barristers of the Hong Kong Bar Association. This year's theme explores the regulations in art law and cryptocurrency. Some very eminent and experienced experts, including not just lawyers, will speak in the panel discussions. I shall just offer some preliminary observations.

  At first glance, the two topics may seem entirely unrelated. In fact, they are both fast-evolving domains which will provide enormous opportunities for young lawyers. Hence, it is an extremely wise choice to put these two topics together in this Conference.

Art law challenges and regulations

  As the world's second-largest art market, second only to New York in contemporary art auctions, Hong Kong is a vibrant hub for artists, collectors and legal professionals alike. Our city boasts significant events such as Art Basel, and we have world-class museums like M+ and the Hong Kong Palace Museum in the West Kowloon Cultural District. Additionally, reputable auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have enhanced their presence in Hong Kong, which further solidifies Hong Kong's status in the global art market.

  Hong Kong's unique legal framework is foundational to this burgeoning art scene. The Basic Law provides a robust legal environment that fosters artistic and cultural activities. Article 34 of the Basic Law guarantees that Hong Kong residents shall have the freedom to engage in artistic creation and other cultural activities. Further, Article 108 of the Basic Law preserves the low tax policy, and as a result, there is no capital gains tax on art pieces; which is particularly enticing for collectors and investors, and this makes Hong Kong a very attractive platform for art transactions. Moreover, Articles 114 and 115 of the Basic Law establish Hong Kong as a free port with free movement of goods which is invaluable for the art market, allowing for seamless movement of art pieces across borders.

  With a solid intellectual property (IP) regime and a sound legal system supervised by an independent judiciary, Hong Kong provides effective IP protection to artists which is vital in safeguarding artistic integrity and development. Hong Kong is also the first in Asia to clarify and confirm the arbitrability of IP disputes, that is, IP disputes can be resolved by arbitration.

  In addition to the above, Hong Kong's close connection with the Mainland has provided us with further opportunities. The mutual legal assistance on the recognition and enforcement of both arbitral awards and judgments in civil and commercial matters enables certain IP disputes to be resolved efficiently by litigation or arbitration. Notably, the Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is more liberal than the 2019 Hague Judgments Convention which excludes judgements on IP disputes entirely.

  As outlined in the 2025 Policy Address, the HKSAR Government will step up our efforts to build Hong Kong into a global premium art trading hub, attracting more international auction houses, galleries, and professionals to establish a presence here. Key initiatives include creating an arts ecosystem at Airport City for studios and galleries, enhancing collaboration with Art Basel, and conducting industry studies on taxation, financing and talent.

  While the future looks promising, there are also significant challenges that we must address as legal professionals in art law.

  One of the most pressing issues is copyright protection, particularly concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in creating art - we need to explore the feasibility of having further enhancement of the Copyright Ordinance regarding the protection for AI technology development.

  As the art market expands, so will the demand for legal services. Issues relating to arts pieces' storage will require expertise in insurance law, bailment law, logistics law, and even tax and financial planning. Legal professionals will therefore be required to draft and enforce art loan and trading agreements in order to ensure that ownership and authenticity of the art pieces are clearly defined and protected.

Development of cryptocurrency in Hong Kong

  Hong Kong is a leading international financial centre in the world. Under Article 109 of the Basic Law, we shall provide an appropriate economic and legal environment for the maintenance of such status.

  As outlined in the 2025 Policy Address, the HKSAR Government is committed to supporting steady fintech development, including encouragement of tokenisation of assets, offering diverse digital asset products to professional investors, and introducing automated reporting and surveillance tools to mitigate risks associated with digital assets. We believe that true innovation in finance would only thrive in a clear, fair and reliable regulatory setting.

Important legal developments in recent years - enhancement of legal and regulatory framework

  I wish to highlight some important legal developments in recent years in this respect.

(a) Licensing of virtual asset service providers since 2023

  Firstly, by amending the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, we have introduced a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers effective from June 2023 to align with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force. Anyone running a virtual asset exchange in Hong Kong must obtain a licence from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). Licensees must meet a fit-and-proper test and comply with investor protection, money laundering and terrorism financing requirements. As of September this year, 11 virtual asset trading platforms have been licensed to offer cryptocurrency trading to retail investors. To address risks seen in the collapses of JPEX and AAX, these platforms must secure insurance for customers' assets, properly segregate client assets, comply with financial resources requirements and prevent conflict of interest. The SFC has broad powers to supervise, investigate and enforce, with penalties for non-compliance ranging from administrative actions to criminal sanctions.

(b) Enacting the Stablecoins Ordinance in 2025

  Second, the Stablecoins Ordinance, enacted in May and becoming effective in August this year, seeks to lay a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the stablecoin industry. Only issuers licensed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) or certain entities can offer stablecoins publicly. As one of the first jurisdictions to put in place a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, the HKMA has imposed rigorous requirements to guard against financial stability risks and to promote investor protection. These include requiring licensees to have a local presence, maintain reserve assets at least equal to the stablecoins' par value, allow easy redemptions without excessive fees, ensure that key personnel are fit and proper, and implement strong risk management to prevent misuse of funds. The law also bans misleading promotional materials and creates offences for unlicensed operations or fraudulent transactions. Under the Stablecoins Ordinance, the HKMA has robust powers for licensing, enforcement and penalties, with a Stablecoin Review Tribunal established to review its decisions.

Intended reforms in future

(a) Proposal to limit unlicensed virtual asset platforms from using misleading names

  Looking ahead to future reforms in this fast-developing area of law, in June this year, the SFC launched a consultation aimed at restricting unregulated entities from improperly adopting names that may mislead the public into believing that such unregulated entities are regulated ones. The proposed reform aims to: (i) prohibit names that falsely suggest SFC regulation or licensing, such as those implying operation as an ""SFC-regulated exchange or clearing house"", or an ""SFC-licensed virtual asset trading platform""; and (ii) prevent misleading titles that imply affiliations with established financial entities, whether in Hong Kong or overseas, without genuine connections.

(b) Proposal to regulate over-the-counter virtual asset dealing and custodian services

  The SFC also held consultations with the industry and the public on the proposal to regulate service providers involved in over-the-counter virtual asset dealing and custodian services, with a view to further enhancing investor protection, combating financial crime, and maintaining market integrity and stability. Under the proposed licensing regime, the service providers would be licensed by SFC. They would be subject to the fit-and-proper test and requirements relating to anti-money laundering, financial resources, risk management and investor protection.

Judicial developments

  Notably, the Hong Kong's Judiciary has also adopted innovative measures, likely to be the first in the world, to assist victims in cryptocurrency-related cases. In BP SG Investment Holding Limited v Chen Shanxian, a fraudster transferred victims' assets into anonymous, decentralised, non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets, making identification and service of court documents extremely difficult and challenging. To address this issue, the Court permitted substituted service of an injunction order via a tokenised order, through a messaging platform between virtual asset wallets, and airdropping a non-fungible token, commonly known as NFT, containing a hyperlink to the court order. This method of service effectively ""taints"" the wallets in the sense that all subsequent transactions that follow the service can be traced to the blockchain and the existence of the injunction can be seen, and hence transactions with those wallets will be deterred.

Challenges and opportunities

  On the other hand, it must be recognised that cryptocurrency may be misused for money laundering and other unlawful or improper behaviour. This is countered by Hong Kong's existing regulatory and criminal law framework. As digital assets grow in complexity, the law in this area evolves rapidly and demands high technical expertise. I would encourage young barristers to also take part in navigating, shaping, and upholding the law in this evolving field.

Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy

  Apart from advising policy bureaus, drafting new laws in these areas and prosecuting crimes involving cryptocurrencies, the Department of Justice also puts a great emphasis on capacity building, including for local lawyers through the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy.

  Launched in November last year, the Academy is an important initiative to provide capacity-building, exchanges and knowledge-sharing for professionals from the legal and dispute resolution sectors in Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and across the globe. Since its launch, the Academy has organised diverse training programmes in Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and abroad.

  For instance, it co-organised the ""Workshop on Use of International Instruments to Legally Enable End-to-End Digitalization of Trade"" with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) last August where international trade law experts and policymakers from different economies discussed how international law instruments could facilitate a harmonised, legally enabling environment for digitalisation of the whole business lifecycle.

  Last week, the Academy hosted the ""Legal Practical Training Course for Chinese Enterprises Going Overseas"" for 30 legal counsel and compliance officers from state-owned enterprises on the risks encountered by Chinese enterprises going overseas and the applicable compliance strategies with lectures on hot topics including stablecoins and global intellectual property.

  This December, the Department of Justice will host its annual flagship event - Hong Kong Legal Week 2025 with the theme ""Linking Laws, Bridging Worlds"". The Academy will collaborate with UNCITRAL again to co-organise the 6th UNCITRAL Asia-Pacific Judicial Summit 2025, during which judges, officials, legal experts and scholars across various jurisdictions will explore digitalisation of trade and possibly covering issues relevant to cryptocurrency.

  Looking ahead, I anticipate more collaborations with the Bar Association, including the YBC, to further enhance Hong Kong's legal expertise in these areas. Opportunities for young and future lawyers in the realms of art law and cryptocurrency are abundant. It is imperative that we equip ourselves with the necessary knowledge and skills and proactively seize these opportunities as they arise.

  Last but not least, I would like to take this opportunity to invite all those who are eligible to exercise your right to vote in the upcoming Legislative Council General Election on December 7. Your active participation is not simply a valuable exercise on a very important constitutional right; it is also a very important choice that will contribute to the future of our legal system, our legal practice and the rule of law, as well as the general well-being of our society.

  On this note, I wish you all a very fruitful and constructive conference this afternoon. Thank you."

文化體育及旅遊局局長出席林家聲慈善基金「我的藝術人生──林家聲」分享講座致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-31 16:48,2025-10-31 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100608.htm,"以下是文化體育及旅遊局局長羅淑佩今日（十月三十一日）出席林家聲慈善基金「我的藝術人生——林家聲」分享講座的致辭全文：

周振基主席（林家聲慈善基金主席）、劉國瑛教授（林家聲慈善基金執行主席）、各位名伶前輩、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。很榮幸今日能夠出席「我的藝術人生——林家聲」分享講座。我自己是一位粵劇愛好者，年少時已跟我媽媽到不同的戲院、百麗殿、荃灣大會堂、新光（戲院）看戲。我也是聲哥——林家聲博士的戲迷，年少時候看了很多聲哥的戲，印象比較深的是《龍鳳爭掛帥》、《火網梵宮十四年》、《胡不歸》、《雷鳴金鼓戰笳聲》等。那時可以看便看，但亦覺得這位老倌好像跟其他老倌有些不同，第一是造型風流倜儻，但永遠都是一身正氣，這是很突出的一點。第二是為何他當做文場戲時，感情如此豐富，你看他演《胡不歸》時十分淒慘，他演武松時揈水髮的關目多厲害。為何他演打戲時，功力這麼強？為何他的北派功夫這麼好？有人能這樣全面？當日是留下了這些印象。今日能與尹飛燕姐姐、南鳳姐姐、吳美英姐姐幾位聲哥的生前好友和合作夥伴聚首一堂，去回顧林家聲博士這位粵劇大師的藝術人生，的的確確感到很珍貴和榮幸能有這個機會。

聲哥是香港粵劇界的一代宗師，他的藝術成就深深影響着整個藝術界、粵劇界。他不僅是位伶影雙棲的演員，亦是一位勇於創新、精益求精的藝術家。剛才亦說過，每次觀賞聲哥的演出，無論是他精湛的唱腔、細膩的做手、以至堅實的北派功架，其實都令觀眾深深着迷，亦會因此愛上粵劇，這門博大精深的藝術。

聲哥生前對藝術非常有熱誠，即使在晚年受到病患的困擾，仍然堅持不懈地鑽研曲藝。最難能可貴的是，就是剛才周振基主席所說，他願意將畢生所學、數十年寶貴的舞台經驗毫無保留地傳給後學，展現了一位藝術家的胸襟與氣度。

今年是聲哥逝世十周年，我要特別感謝林家聲慈善基金舉辦這次別具意義的紀念展覽及講座，更邀請到幾位與聲哥合作多年的粵劇界前輩，分享他們與聲哥相處的點點滴滴，我相信一定能為我們呈現一個更立體、更真實的林家聲博士。

粵劇是香港重要的文化瑰寶，作為文化體育及旅遊局局長，我和同事們一直致力支持粵劇的傳承與發展。聲哥畢生投入粵劇藝術，培育後進，他的精神和貢獻，永遠值得我們學習。我期望通過今次展覽和講座，能讓更多人重新認識這位粵劇大師，同時加深對粵劇藝術的認識與欣賞。

我衷心祝願這次活動圓滿成功。讓我們繼續秉承聲哥對粵劇的熱愛，共同維護和發揚這項珍貴的文化遺產。多謝大家。"
Residential mortgage loans in negative equity: End of September 2025,2025-10-31 16:45,2025-10-31 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100568.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced today (October 31) the results of its survey on residential mortgage loans (RMLs) in negative equity at end-September 2025.

  The estimated number of RMLs in negative equity was 31 449 cases at end-September 2025, as compared to 37 806 cases at end-June 2025. These cases were mainly related to bank staff housing loans or RMLs under mortgage insurance programme, which generally have a higher loan-to-value ratio.

  The aggregate value of RMLs in negative equity decreased to HK$156.8 billion at end-September 2025 compared with HK$190.2 billion at end-June 2025.

  The unsecured portion of these loans decreased to HK$10.9 billion at end-September 2025 from HK$14.3 billion at end-June 2025.

  The three-month delinquency ratio of RMLs in negative equity remained at a low level of 0.24 per cent at end-September 2025 as compared to 0.21 per cent at end-June 2025.

  It is important to note that the figures derived from this survey relate only to RMLs provided by authorized institutions on the basis of first mortgages and which the reporting institution knows to be in negative equity (i.e. the outstanding loan amount with the reporting institution exceeds the current market value of the mortgaged property). Not included in these figures are RMLs associated with co-financing schemes which would be in negative equity if the second mortgages were taken into account. The extent to which such RMLs are in negative equity is not known because authorized institutions do not maintain records on the outstanding balances of the second mortgages.

  The mortgage portfolios of the surveyed authorized institutions represent about 99 per cent of the industry total. The survey results have been extrapolated to estimate the position of the banking sector as a whole."
Monetary Statistics for September 2025,2025-10-31 16:45,2025-10-31 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100571.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

According to statistics published today (October 31) by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, total deposits with authorized institutions increased by 1.3 per cent in September 2025. Among the total, Hong Kong dollar deposits and foreign currency deposits increased by 1.4per cent and 1.3per cent respectively in September. In the year to end-September, total deposits and Hong Kong dollar deposits increased by 10.2per cent and 4.1per cent respectively. Renminbi deposits in Hong Kong increased by 3.5per cent in September to RMB1,001.8 billion at the end of September. The total remittance of renminbi for cross-border trade settlement amounted to RMB1,123.2 billion in September, compared with RMB996.9 billion in August. It should be noted that changes in deposits are affected by a wide range of factors, such as interest rate movements and fund-raising activities. It is therefore more appropriate to observe the longer-term trends, and not to over-generalise fluctuations in a single month.

Total loans and advances increased by 0.7per cent in September, and increased by 1.6per cent in the year to end-September. Among the total, loans for use in Hong Kong (including trade finance) and loans for use outside Hong Kong increased by 0.6per cent and 0.7per cent respectively in September. The Hong Kong dollar loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 73.6per cent at the end of September from 74.6per cent at the end of August, as Hong Kong dollar deposits increased while Hong Kong dollar loans remained virtually unchanged.

For the third quarter of 2025 as a whole, loans for use in Hong Kong (including trade finance) decreased by 0.4per cent after increasing by 1.6per cent in the previous quarter. Analysed by economic use, loans to building, construction, property development and investment decreased, while loans to financial concerns increased.

Hong Kong dollar M2 and M3 both increased by 1.4per cent in September, and both increased by 4.5per cent when compared to a year ago. The seasonally-adjusted Hong Kong dollar M1 decreased by 1.4per cent in September, while increased by 11.5per cent compared to a year ago, reflecting in part investment-related activities. Total M2 and total M3 both increased by 1.3per cent in September. Compared to a year earlier, total M2 and total M3 both increased by 11.1per cent.

As monthly monetary statistics are subject to volatilities due to a wide range of transient factors, such as seasonal funding demand as well as business and investment-related activities, caution is required when interpreting the statistics.

二○二五年九月份貨幣統計數字,2025-10-31 16:45,2025-10-31 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100577.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局今日（十月三十一日）發表的統計數字顯示，認可機構的存款總額在二○二五年九月份上升1.3%，其中港元存款及外幣存款分別上升1.4%及1.3%。由年初截至九月底計，存款總額及港元存款分別上升10.2%及4.1%。香港人民幣存款在九月份上升3.5%，於九月底為10,018億元人民幣。跨境貿易結算的人民幣匯款總額於九月份為11,232億元人民幣，而八月份為9,969億元人民幣。存款變動受多項因素影響，包括利率走勢、市場集資活動等，因此適宜觀察較長期趨勢，毋須過度解讀個別月份的波動。

九月份貸款與墊款總額上升0.7%，由年初截至九月底計上升1.6%。其中在香港使用的貸款（包括貿易融資）及香港境外使用的貸款在九月份分別上升0.6%及0.7%。由於港元存款上升而港元貸款沒有明顯變動，港元貸存比率由八月底的74.6%，下跌至九月底的73.6%。

在香港使用的貸款（包括貿易融資）繼上季上升1.6%後，在二○二五年第3季按季下跌0.4%。按經濟用途分析，對建造業、物業發展與投資的貸款下跌，而對金融公司的貸款則上升。

九月份港元貨幣供應量M2及M3均上升1.4%，與去年同期比較均上升4.5%。九月份經季節因素調整的港元貨幣供應量M1下跌1.4%，與去年同期比較則上升11.5%，部分反映投資相關活動。貨幣供應量總額M2及M3於九月份均上升1.3%，與去年同期比較，M2及M3均上升11.1%。

由於按月貨幣統計數字或會受到各種短期因素（例如季節性的資金需求，以及營商與投資相關活動）影響而出現波動，因此應小心詮釋統計數字。

二○二五年第三季末負資產住宅按揭貸款,2025-10-31 16:45,2025-10-31 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100565.htm,"下稿代香港金融管理局發出︰

香港金融管理局今日（十月三十一日）公布二○二五年第三季末負資產住宅按揭貸款的最新調查結果。

二○二五年第三季末負資產住宅按揭貸款宗數為31 449宗，二○二五年第二季末為37 806宗。這些個案主要涉及銀行職員的住屋按揭貸款或按揭保險計劃的貸款，而這類貸款的按揭成數一般較高。

負資產住宅按揭貸款涉及的金額由二○二五年第二季末的1,902億港元，減少至二○二五年第三季末的1,568億港元。

負資產住宅按揭貸款中無抵押部分的金額由二○二五年第二季末的143億港元，減少至二○二五年第三季末的109億港元。

二○二五年第三季末拖欠三個月以上的負資產住宅按揭貸款比率為0.24%，相較二○二五年第二季末的0.21%，仍維持於低水平。

必須注意的是，此調查所得數字僅涉及銀行提供並已知道為負資產的一按貸款（即欠受訪機構的未償還貸款額超過按揭物業的當前市值），當中並不包括涉及二按，而連同二按計算屬於負資產貸款的住宅按揭貸款。由於銀行沒有客戶在二按下的未償還貸款的資料，因此無法知悉其中有多少宗屬於負資產貸款。

受訪認可機構的按揭貸款額約佔整個銀行體系按揭貸款總額的99%。調查結果是經過推算得出，以估計整個銀行體系的負資產按揭貸款情況。"

香港金融管理局（金管局）今日（十月三十一日）公布，截至二○二五年九月三十日，外匯基金總資產為41,522億港元，較二○二五年八月底增加820億港元，其中港元資產增加972億港元，外幣資產則減少152億港元。

港元資產增加，主要是因為獲認購而未交收的外匯基金票據及債券的月底餘額增加及香港股票按市價重估。外幣資產減少，主要是因為提取財政儲備存款及已購入但未結算證券的月底餘額減少，但有關減幅因來自投資的利息收入及投資按市價重估而被部分抵銷。

貨幣發行局帳目顯示，二○二五年九月底的貨幣基礎為20,202億港元，較二○二五年八月底增加60億港元，增幅為0.3%。貨幣基礎增加，主要是由於負債證明書總額增加及已發行外匯基金票據及債券的折價攤銷。

二○二五年九月底的支持資產總額增加70億港元至22,182億港元，增幅為0.3%。支持資產增加，主要是因為來自投資的利息收入。支持比率由二○二五年八月底的109.78%，上升至二○二五年九月底的109.80%。

二零二五年第三季本地生產總值預先估計數字,2025-10-31 16:30,2025-10-31 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100368.htm,"政府統計處今日（十月三十一日）發布二零二五年第三季的本地生產總值預先估計數字。

根據預先估計數字，二零二五年第三季本地生產總值較上年同期實質上升3.8%，而第二季的升幅為3.1%。

按本地生產總值各個主要組成部分分析，私人消費開支在二零二五年第三季與上年同期比較實質上升2.1%，而第二季的升幅為1.9%。

按國民經濟核算定義計算的政府消費開支，在二零二五年第三季與上年同期比較錄得1.6%的實質升幅，而第二季的升幅為2.5%。

本地固定資本形成總額繼二零二五年第二季實質上升1.9%後，在第三季與上年同期比較進一步上升4.3%。

同期，按國民經濟核算定義計算，貨品出口總額與上年同期比較錄得12.2%的實質升幅，而第二季的升幅為11.5%。按國民經濟核算定義計算，貨品進口在二零二五年第三季實質上升11.7%，而第二季的升幅為12.6%。

服務輸出繼二零二五年第二季實質上升8.6%後，在第三季與上年同期比較上升6.1%。服務輸入在二零二五年第三季實質上升2.6%，而第二季的升幅為7.3%。

經季節性調整而作相連季度比較的本地生產總值，在二零二五年第三季較第二季實質上升0.7%。

評論

政府發言人表示，受出口繼續大幅上升及內部需求持續擴張帶動，二零二五年第三季香港經濟表現蓬勃。根據預先估計數字，實質本地生產總值按年增長3.8%，較上一季3.1%的增幅大。經季節性調整後按季比較，實質本地生產總值進一步上升0.7%。

按主要開支組成部分分析，電子相關產品需求強勁和區域貿易往來暢旺，帶動整體貨物出口在第三季繼續顯著增長。服務輸出亦明顯擴張，主要受訪港旅遊業持續增長，以及跨境金融活動在環球股市上升的情況下表現活躍所支持。本地方面，私人消費開支進一步增長。隨着經濟擴張及住宅物業市場回穩，整體投資開支升幅加快。

展望未來，香港經濟在二零二五年餘下時間應會進一步穩健增長。環球經濟短期內維持溫和增長，加上電子相關產品近期持續強勁的需求，應會進一步支持香港的貨物出口。訪港旅客人次繼續上升及金融市場活動暢旺應會進一步為服務出口提供動力。本地方面，美國自今年九月以來重啓減息有利資產市場氣氛；加上消費信心逐漸恢復，營商氣氛與今年較早時相比亦有顯著改善，這些發展應會支持本地消費和投資活動。政府多項發展經濟和開拓多元化市場的措施亦會提供支持。然而，外部不確定性，特別是貿易壁壘對環球經濟、國際貿易及金融狀況帶來的持續影響，仍需密切關注。

二零二五年第三季本地生產總值的修訂數字和更詳細的統計數字，以及二零二五年全年本地生產總值的修訂預測，將會在二零二五年十一月十四日公布。

進一步資料

二零二四年第三季至二零二五年第三季本地生產總值及選定主要開支組成部分的按年實質變動百分率載於表1。

當獲得更多數據後，政府統計處會編製本地生產總值的修訂數字。二零二五年第三季的本地生產總值修訂數字及更詳細分項統計數字，將於二零二五年十一月十四日在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/scode250.html） 和《按開支組成部分劃分的本地生產總值》報告（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1030001&scode=250）公布。

在二零二五年九月的零售業總銷貨價值中，網上銷售佔12.5%。該月的零售業網上銷售價值的臨時估計為39億元，較二零二四年同月上升27.3%。二零二五年八月的零售業網上銷售價值的修訂估計較二零二四年同月上升8.7%。與二零二四年同期比較，二零二五年首九個月合計的零售業網上銷售價值的臨時估計上升6.3%。

扣除其間價格變動後，二零二五年九月的零售業總銷貨數量的臨時估計較二零二四年同月上升4.8%。二零二五年八月的零售業總銷貨數量的修訂估計較二零二四年同月上升3.4%。與二零二四年同期比較，二零二五年首九個月合計的零售業總銷貨數量的臨時估計下跌2.3%。

按零售商主要類別的銷貨價值的臨時估計由高至低分析，二零二五年九月與二零二四年九月比較，電器及其他未分類耐用消費品的銷貨價值上升31.3%。其次為超級市場貨品（銷貨價值上升2.0%）；其他未分類消費品（上升6.9%）；珠寶首飾、鐘錶及名貴禮物（上升9.1%）；食品、酒類飲品及煙草（上升3.9%）；藥物及化妝品（上升7.6%）；百貨公司貨品（上升2.8%）；以及眼鏡店（上升1.5%）。

評論

政府發言人表示，零售業在九月繼續恢復。零售業總銷貨價值按年上升5.9%，升幅較上月進一步加快。大部分主要零售商類別均錄得不同程度的銷售升幅。

展望未來，本地消費氣氛逐步改善，以及訪港旅遊業持續增長，應繼續為零售業務帶來支持。

進一步資料

表1列出二零二五年八月所有零售商及按零售商主要類別劃分的零售業銷貨價值指數及零售業銷貨價值的修訂數字，以及二零二五年九月的臨時數字；同時亦列出二零二五年首九個月合計的所有零售商及按零售商主要類別劃分的零售業銷貨價值及其按年變動的臨時數字。

表2列出二零二五年八月零售業網上銷售價值的修訂數字，以及二零二五年九月的臨時數字；同時亦列出二零二五年首九個月合計的按年變動的臨時數字。

表3列出二零二五年八月所有零售商及按零售商主要類別劃分的零售業銷貨數量指數的修訂數字，以及二零二五年九月的臨時數字；同時亦列出二零二五年首九個月合計的按年變動的臨時數字。

表4展示零售業總銷貨價值及數量的變動情況，列出以原來數列計算某月份與一年前同月比較的按年變動百分率，及以經季節性調整數列計算，截至所示月份的三個月與先前三個月比較的變動百分率。

零售業公司的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各經濟統計調查，把經濟單位撥歸不同的行業類別。

上述零售業銷貨額統計數字量度本地零售業公司銷售貨品的收益，主要是用來評估本地零售業短期的業務表現。零售業銷貨額數據是經由「零售業銷貨額按月統計調查」從本地零售業公司搜集。該統計調查涵蓋不論是否設有實體店的本地零售業公司，而其透過傳統店鋪及網上渠道的銷貨額均包含在零售業銷貨額統計數字內。

零售業銷貨額統計數字包括消費者在貨品方面的開支，但不包括佔消費者整體開支超過50%的服務開支（例如房屋、餐飲、醫療及保健服務、交通及通訊、金融服務、教育及娛樂方面的開支）。此外，數據包括訪港旅客在本港購買貨品方面的開支，但不包括香港居民在境外的開支。因此，數據不應視為量度消費者整體開支的指標。

對消費者整體開支趨勢有興趣的人士，應參考作為按季發表的本地生產總值一個主要組成部分的私人消費開支的數列。根據廣泛資料來源編製的私人消費開支統計數字，涵蓋了香港居民不論在本地或境外在貨品（包括從所有途徑購買的貨品）和服務兩方面的消費開支。有關詳情請參閱政府統計處出版的《按開支組成部分劃分的本地生產總值》。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《零售業銷貨額按月統計調查報告》。用戶可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080003&scode=530）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Provisional Statistics of Retail Sales for September 2025,2025-10-31 16:30,2025-10-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100341.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released the latest figures on retail sales today (October 31).

  The value of total retail sales in September 2025, provisionally estimated at $31.3 billion, increased by 5.9% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of the value of total retail sales in August 2025 increased by 3.9% compared with a year earlier. For the first 9 months of 2025 taken together, it was provisionally estimated that the value of total retail sales decreased by 1.0% compared with the same period in 2024.

The value of online retail sales in that month, provisionally estimated at $3.9 billion, increased by 27.3% compared with the same month in 2024. The revised estimate of online retail sales in August 2025 increased by 8.7% compared with a year earlier. For the first 9 months of 2025 taken together, it was provisionally estimated that the value of online retail sales increased by 6.3% compared with the same period in 2024.

Commentary

  A government spokesman said that the retail sector continued to recover in September. The value of total retail sales increased by 5.9% over a year earlier, accelerating further from the increase in the preceding month. Most broad retail outlet types registered varying degrees of growth in sales.

  Looking ahead, improving local consumer sentiment and sustained growth in inbound tourism should continue to render support to retail businesses.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the revised figures on value index and value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for August 2025 as well as the provisional figures for September 2025. The provisional figures on the value of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet as well as the corresponding year-on-year changes for the first 9 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 2 presents the revised figures on value of online retail sales for August 2025 as well as the provisional figures for September 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first 9 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 3 presents the revised figures on volume index of retail sales for all retail outlets and by broad type of retail outlet for August 2025 as well as the provisional figures for September 2025. The provisional figures on year-on-year changes for the first 9 months of 2025 taken together are also shown.

  Table 4 shows the movements of the value and volume of total retail sales in terms of the year-on-year rate of change for a month compared with the same month in the preceding year based on the original series, and in terms of the rate of change for a three-month period compared with the preceding three-month period based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The classification of retail companies follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification (HSIC) Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  These retail sales statistics measure the sales receipts in respect of goods sold by local retail companies and are primarily intended for gauging the short-term business performance of the local retail sector. Data on retail sales are collected from local retail companies through the Monthly Survey of Retail Sales (MRS). Local retail companies with and without physical shops are covered in MRS and their sales, both through conventional shops and online channels, are included in the retail sales statistics.

  The retail sales statistics cover consumer spending on goods but not on services (such as those on housing, catering, medical care and health services, transport and communication, financial services, education and entertainment) which account for over 50% of the overall consumer spending. Moreover, they include spending on goods in Hong Kong by visitors but exclude spending outside Hong Kong by Hong Kong residents. Hence they should not be regarded as indicators for measuring overall consumer spending.

  Users interested in the trend of overall consumer spending should refer to the data series of private consumption expenditure (PCE), which is a major component of the Gross Domestic Product published at quarterly intervals. Compiled from a wide range of data sources, PCE covers consumer spending on both goods (including goods purchased from all channels) and services by Hong Kong residents whether locally or abroad. Please refer to the C&SD publication ""Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Component"" for more details.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey of Retail Sales"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080003&scode=530).

  Expenditure and revenue from April to September 2025 amounted to HK$373.2 billion and HK$235.2 billion respectively, resulting in a deficit of HK$103.2 billion after taking into account HK$61.6 billion received from issuance of Government Bonds and repayment of HK$26.8 billion principal on Government Bonds.

  A Government spokesperson said that the deficit for the period was mainly due to the fact that some major types of revenue including salaries and profits taxes are mostly received towards the end of a financial year.

  The fiscal reserves stood at HK$551.1 billion as at September 30, 2025.

  Detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Exchange Fund Abridged Balance Sheet and Currency Board Account,2025-10-31 16:30,2025-10-31 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100551.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced today (October 31) that the total assets of the Exchange Fund amounted to HK$4,152.2billion as at September 30, 2025, HK$82.0 billion higher than that at the end of August 2025. Hong Kong dollar assets increased by HK$97.2 billion while foreign currency assets decreased by HK$15.2 billion.

The rise in Hong Kong dollar assets was mainly due to the increase in Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued but not yet settled at month end and mark-to-market revaluation of Hong Kong equities. The decline in foreign currency assets was mainly due to withdrawals of Fiscal Reserves placements and reduction in the month-end balances of unsettled purchase of securities, which were partly offset by interest income from investments and mark-to-market revaluation of investments.

The Currency Board Account shows that the Monetary Base at the end of September 2025 was HK$2,020.2 billion, increased by HK$6.0 billion, or 0.3 per cent, from the end of August 2025. The increase was mainly due to the increase in the outstanding amount of Certificates of Indebtedness and the amortisation of discount on Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued.

The amount of Backing Assets increased by HK$7.0 billion, or 0.3 per cent, to HK$2,218.2 billion at the end of September 2025. The increase was mainly attributable to interest income from investments. The Backing Ratio increased from 109.78 per cent at the end of August 2025 to 109.80 per cent at the end of September 2025.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that the Hong Kong economy staged a robust performance in the third quarter of 2025, driven by a continued surge in exports and sustained expansion in domestic demand. According to the advance estimates, real GDP grew by 3.8% over a year earlier, picking up from the 3.1% growth in the preceding quarter. On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, real GDP rose further by 0.7%.

  Analysed by major expenditure component, total exports of goods continued to grow markedly in the third quarter, propelled by strong demand for electronic-related products and buoyant regional trade flows. Exports of services also expanded notably, mainly supported by continued growth in inbound tourism and vibrant cross-boundary financial activities amid rises in global stock markets. Domestically, private consumption expenditure grew further. Overall investment expenditure saw an accelerated increase alongside the economic expansion and stabilisation in the residential property market.

  Looking ahead, the Hong Kong economy should see further solid growth for the rest of 2025. Sustained moderate growth of the global economy in the near term, together with the persistent stellar demand for electronic-related products of late, should provide further support to Hong Kong's exports of goods. Continued increase in visitor arrivals and vibrant financial market activities should provide further impetus to exports of services. On the domestic front, the renewed interest rate cuts in the United States since this September are conducive to boosting asset market sentiment. Coupled with a gradual recovery in consumption confidence and also a visible improvement in business sentiment from earlier this year, these developments should lend support to local consumption and investment activity. The Government's various measures to develop the economy and diversify markets will also provide support. However, external uncertainties, especially those arising from the ongoing impacts of trade barriers on the global economy, international trade and financial conditions still warrant close monitoring.

  The revised figures on GDP and more detailed statistics for the third quarter of 2025, as well as the revised GDP forecast for 2025, will be released on November 14, 2025.

律政司副司長在第九屆環球大灣區可持續發展經貿高峰論壇暨2025大灣區年度最具影響力大獎頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-31 16:25,2025-10-31 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100540.htm,"以下是律政司副司長今日（十月三十一日）在第九屆環球大灣區可持續發展經貿高峰論壇——「全球鏈接．蓄勢騰飛」暨2025大灣區年度最具影響力大獎頒獎典禮的致辭：

尊敬的施家殷院士（粵港澳大灣區經貿協會榮譽會長及召集人）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我非常高興獲邀出席第九屆環球大灣區可持續發展經貿高峰論壇。今天論壇以「全球鏈接．蓄勢騰飛」為主題，非常精準描述了大灣區在全球化新格局下的戰略定位。論壇同時為2025大灣區年度最具影響力大獎頒獎，我謹向所有獲獎機構和朋友致以熱烈祝賀！

接下來，我將聚焦分享香港如何以法治優勢，為大灣區的「全球鏈接」提供堅實保障。

一．具公信力的香港法律制度

香港的普通法制度作為全球唯一中英雙語普通法體系，以及國家唯一的普通法司法管轄區，確保了商業規則與全球重要經濟體銜接。香港司法機構一直以獨立透明見稱，法院的判例一直備受其他普通法適用地區重視。舉個例子，倫敦樞密院司法委員會近期一宗有關公司清盤問題的判決，就參考並論及多達六宗香港過去數年的判決。由此可見，香港司法機構和法院在國際上享有非常崇高的聲譽。

我們的優勢不僅體現在制度建設上，香港的法律框架亦一直與時並進。今年八月生效的《穩定幣條例》就是一個好例子，因為《條例》涵蓋發牌制度和投資者保障機制，確保穩定幣市場穩健有序地發展。

香港在法治基礎建設方面的努力，獲得國際認可：根據瑞士國際管理發展學院《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港被評為擁有全球最佳商業法規。

企業在營商或投資過程中，難免出現爭議。香港的法律制度是企業解決爭議的首選，企業可以通過香港具公信力的法院解決爭議。近年，內地與香港訂立了相互執行法院判決的安排（《安排》），為雙方當事人提供了在內地執行香港法院判決的便捷途徑。該《安排》涵蓋合約、侵權，以及部分知識產權糾紛，有效避免當事人進行重複訴訟，並節省解決爭議的經濟成本。

我理解商界朋友非常關注《安排》的實際運作情況。在此，我和大家分享一些最新的數據：自去年一月底《安排》生效以來，內地法院已受理五宗相關申請，其中三宗已獲認可和執行，兩宗因程序要求未達標而被駁回。同時，香港法院也就六宗申請作出登記命令，准許在香港認可和執行內地判決。

這些數據顯示《安排》運作大致暢順，司法機關有效把關。不過，我們亦必須讓更多企業朋友注意到《安排》下適用的具體要求。在這方面，香港超過13 000名法律專業人士，包括來自40多個司法管轄區的海外律師，均可為企業提供專業協助。

二．與國際接軌的仲裁基礎設施和緊急濟助機制

除了法庭訴訟，香港的替代爭議解決體系也充分反映我們背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢。根據最新的國際調查，香港獲選為全球第二、亞太區第一受歡迎的仲裁地，這充分證明香港獲國際社會高度認可和信賴。

香港的《仲裁條例》採納《示範法》，與國際接軌，強調尊重當事人自主，盡可能減低司法干預，同時平衡各方利益。展望未來，我們也會積極研究修訂條例，確保香港的仲裁法律框架與時並進，滿足市場最新需求。

香港的另一大優勢，在於提供便捷且具強制力的臨時濟助機制。根據《仲裁條例》，仲裁庭發布的臨時措施，只要經法院批准，便可如同法院命令般強制執行，防止資產轉移或保存關鍵證據。

同時，香港與內地多年來在仲裁領域深化合作，也是香港具備獨特優勢的原因。在法律機制對接方面，兩地落實了《仲裁保全安排》和《執行安排》，司法協助貫穿整個仲裁程序，讓當事人可以申請跨境保全，以及跨境執行裁決，更好保障各方的利益。

三．規則銜接與機制創新

另外，香港一直積極推進大灣區法治建設。去年，我們以「三連、兩通、一灣區」為行動方針，發布了《粵港澳大灣區法治建設行動綱領》，並逐步按照「行動綱領」落實了多項措施。

令人鼓舞的是，今年二月迎來了規則銜接方面的重大突破，就是「港資港法」與「港資港仲裁」措施的擴展。「港資港法」目前適用於深圳和珠海，「港資港仲裁」除內地自貿區外，也適用於大灣區內地九市。門檻也進一步放寬，只要港資企業在相關城市登記設立，不論投資比例，均可受惠。

這些措施為企業提供了更靈活、更國際化的法律保障，深受香港和海外商界歡迎。現時已有深圳仲裁機構成功處理選擇「港仲裁」的案件，證明政策取得實質成效。我們期待聽到更多持份者選用港資措施的反饋，以便進一步完善大灣區爭議解決的協作。

隨着國際調解院總部剛在上周於香港開業，律政司會繼續積極深化國際及區域合作，支持國際調解院提供友好、靈活、經濟且高效的調解服務，為各類爭議提供更多元、更高校的解決路徑。


總的而言，在地緣政治衝突升温、貿易保護主義重臨、全球經貿格局重新洗牌這百年未有的大變局中，企業選擇香港，就是選擇了「中國優勢」與「國際優勢」兩者兼得；選擇香港的普通法制度，就是選擇了穩定性、可預期性，以及公信力的法律保障和支撐。

今日的論壇將聚焦經貿的前沿發展議題，並設有投資項目及人才配對環節，定可為大灣區高質量發展注入新動能。

最後，我藉此機會和大家宣傳一下，接下來的立法會換屆選舉將會在十二月七日正式投票，現在正是提名期。香港人才輩出，我呼籲香港的有能之士參與這次選舉，為香港作出更大的貢獻，同時呼籲各位朋友緊記十二月七日，可能你要到大灣區其他城市工作、玩樂或學習，但請記得在當日先和家人投票後才到大灣區其他城市。祝願本次論壇圓滿成功，各位身體健康、生意興隆！謝謝大家！"

中國人民抗日戰爭的勝利，是中華民族走向偉大復興的重要里程碑，堅定捍衛了國家主權和領土完整。這場戰爭不僅有全國軍民的英勇奮戰，更有無數海外華僑，以各種方式全力支援祖國，成為抗戰中一股重要力量。

今年是抗戰勝利80周年，香港僑界社團聯會透過圖片展，重現海外華僑在抗戰期間的艱苦奮鬥與無私奉獻。這次展出的超過300幅圖片，是歷史的見證，更是民族精神的傳承。華僑雖然身處異鄉，但在國家最需要的時候，心繫祖國，血脈相連，積極組織抗戰力量，展現了「國家興亡，匹夫有責」的崇高情懷。

華僑的支援，不僅在物質上增強祖國的抗戰力量，更鼓舞了全國軍民的鬥志。這些事蹟向世界展示了中華民族團結一心、不畏艱難的偉大精神，也為世界反法西斯戰爭的勝利作出重要貢獻。

在今天實現中華民族偉大復興的道路上，我們同樣需要發揚這種團結精神，匯聚各方力量，共同推動國家發展。

特區政府一直高度重視愛國主義教育，通過各種方式增進公眾對國家歷史的認識，培養家國情懷。在二○二五年《施政報告》中，行政長官提到會修繕保護全港各區的抗戰遺址，並將其融入教育活動中，加深大眾對香港抗戰歷史的認識。

除了透過展覽培養家國情懷，我們也應實踐對社區、對國家的責任。正如剛才黃會長也說到，十二月七日是立法會換屆選舉，我鼓勵大家踴躍投票，選出愛國愛港的優秀人才進入立法會，共同為香港的未來發展貢獻智慧與力量。

最後，我再次感謝香港僑界社團聯會籌辦這次極具意義的圖片展。祝願展覽圓滿成功，各位身體健康、生活美滿。謝謝大家！"

衞生署明年一月一日按機制調整服務收費及推行配發藥物新安排,2025-10-31 16:05,2025-10-31 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100376.htm,"​為配合政府明年一月一日實施的公營醫療收費改革，衞生署今日（十月三十一日）宣布轄下診所部分公眾服務由二○二六年一月一日起調整收費，新收費項目今日已刊登憲報。另外，衞生署因應醫院管理局（醫管局）的新措施，轄下診所亦會由明年一月一日起實施新配藥安排。

收費調整
————

按既定機制，衞生署提供的臨床服務與醫管局所提供同類或類似服務的收費水平掛鈎（例如家庭醫學門診或專科門診的診症服務等），確保整個公營醫療系統內同類醫療服務的收費水平保持一致。

因應早前宣布於明年一月一日實施的公營醫療收費改革，衞生署亦會同步調整部分公眾服務的收費（見附表），主要涉及診金和藥費，收費水平按醫管局同類服務的收費釐定。

配發藥物新安排
———————

衞生署亦會於明年一月一日開始優化藥物配發安排，以減少浪費藥物，更好運用珍貴的公共醫療資源，同時有效避免病人囤積藥物而引致用藥安全隱患。由明年一月一日起，衞生署診所的病人每次經診治後，最多將獲配發24個星期服用量的藥物。如病人獲醫生處方多於24個星期藥物，領取藥物時會同時獲配發首24個星期藥物和一張「取藥單」，供病人於指定日期到同一藥房，覆配餘下份量的藥物。每種藥物收費以4星期為收費單位。

與此同時，衞生署人員會因應個別病人的健康和實際情況，例如行動不便的長者或輪椅使用者，酌情一次過配發多於24個星期的藥物。

衞生署診所的醫生在處方「有需要時服用藥物」時，會按病人臨床需要而處方實際所需配發數量。如病人確認家中尚有剩餘的同款藥物，醫生會相應調整處方數量，減少藥物浪費，同時避免病人囤積藥物而引致用藥安全隱患。

DH to adjust service fees and implement new arrangement for drug dispensing service starting January 1 next year,2025-10-31 16:05,2025-10-31 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100371.htm,"  âTo align with the Government's fees and charges reform for public healthcare on January 1, 2026, the Department of Health (DH) today (October 31) announced that the fees for certain public services at DH clinics will be adjusted starting January 1 next year. The new fee schedule was published in the gazette today. Additionally, due to the new measures by the Hospital Authority (HA), the DH clinics will implement new arrangement for drug dispensing service starting January 1 next year as well.
  
Fee adjustments
-------------------

  Under the established mechanism, the fees for clinical services provided by the DH are linked to the fees for similar or comparable services provided by the HA (such as consultation services at the Family Medicine Out-patient Services or Specialist Out-patient Services). This ensures consistency in fee levels for similar medical services across the entire public healthcare system.
  
  In response to the previously announced fees and charges reform, which is set to take effect on January 1 next year, the DH will also adjust the fees for certain public services (see annex) at the same time. This primarily involves consultation fees and drug charges, with fee levels based on those for similar HA services.

New arrangement for drug dispensing service
-----------------------------

  The DH will also optimise the arrangement of drug dispensing service starting from January 1 next year, with a view to reducing drug wastage, optimising the use of precious public healthcare resources, and preventing patients from stockpiling drugs which could lead to potential issues on the safe use of drugs. Starting from January 1, 2026, patients will receive a maximum supply of medication for 24 weeks after each consultation at DH clinics. Patients who have been prescribed more than 24 weeks of medication will be given the first 24 weeks' supply together with a ""Refill Slip"" when they pick up their medication. They can then collect the remaining medication at the same dispensary on a specified date. Each chargeable unit covers a duration of up to a four-week supply of a drug item.
  
  At the same time, the DH will exercise discretion to provide more than a 24-week supply of medication in one go, taking into account the health conditions and circumstances of individual patients, such as elderly with mobility issues or wheelchair users etc.
  
  When prescribing ""as required"" medications, doctors of DH clinics will prescribe the actual quantity required according to patients' clinical needs. If patients confirm that they have a sufficient quantity of the same drug at home, doctors will adjust the prescribed amount accordingly to minimise drug wastage and prevent patients from stockpiling drugs, which may pose potential risks to drug safety.

醫院管理局公布優化醫療費用減免機制下的申請安排,2025-10-31 16:04,2025-10-31 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100372.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）今日（十月三十一日）公布優化醫療費用減免機制下的申請安排。已預約於明年在公立醫院應診的病人，如需要申請醫療費用減免，最早可分階段於二○二五年十一月起預先提交申請。此外，醫管局亦會於明年一至三月期間採取特別過渡安排，便利有需要申請醫療費用減免的市民。醫管局已設立專責隊伍協助病人處理申請醫療費用減免的相關事宜。

醫管局發言人說︰「公營醫療收費改革將於明年一月一日實施，醫管局會同步引進一系列加強保障病人的措施，當中包括優化現時的醫療費用減免機制，讓合資格受惠的人士由30萬增加至140萬。」

為了處理新增的費用減免申請，醫管局會於明年一至三月過渡期間採取一系列特別過渡安排，以便病人適時獲知審核結果，有關特別過渡安排如下：


病人如已預約於明年一月或二月在公立醫院應診，可於就診前兩個月（即二○二五年十一月或十二月）提交所需證明文件。病人的申請將獲預先審核，合資格者可於明年一月一日公營醫療收費改革實施後，在覆診前獲發醫療費用減免證明書；及
有經濟困難的病人，如需即日或緊急接受治療，但又未能提供相關文件完成經濟審查，醫管局會在過渡期間發出「有條件減免」豁免全額或部分醫療費用。合資格的病人只需在三個月內補交相關文件，通過審查後便可獲發正式醫療費用減免證明書。


與此同時，現時已持有醫療費用減免證明書（不論全額或部分減免）的病人，可繼續獲得減免，毋須重新申請，直至證明書的有效期完結為止。若病人現時持有部分醫療費用減免證明書，並符合放寬後全額減免的資格，病人可於明年起在預約就診前三個月內或住院後的三個月內，前往醫務社會服務部，聲明財務狀況無顯著變化後，便可根據新準則獲得全額減免，毋須再次進行評估，而有效期至原有醫療費用減免證明書到期日。

作為公營醫療收費改革的重要部分，醫療費用減免的門檻將於明年一月一日起放寬，其中收入限額放寬至家庭住戶每月入息中位數100%（二人或以上家庭）或每月入息中位數的150%（一人家庭住戶）；而資產限額則放寬至申請公屋資產限額。此外，醫療費用減免申請程序及涵蓋範圍亦會優化，以進一步便利市民，當中包括放寬「家庭」定義，與申請人無密切經濟關係的同住家庭成員或可無需納入經濟審查；擴闊有限期醫療費用減免涵蓋範圍至偶發性家庭醫學門診服務，並延長最長12 個月的減免有效期至18 個月；病人如在18個月內再次申請減免，只需簽署聲明書確認家庭財政狀況不變，毋須重新提交經濟文件作審查。

病人可向各公立醫院或診所的醫務社會服務部、社會福利署綜合家庭服務中心、保護家庭及兒童服務課或其他指定服務單位申請醫療費用減免。市民亦可透過醫管局手機應用程式「HA Go」登入「醫療費用援助一站通」了解醫療費用減免申請方法，以及透過「HA Go」或登入醫管局網頁（ewsecal.ha.org.hk/calculator/index.html?lang=tc）內的經濟審查計算程式（適用於二○二六年一月一日起的申請）於網上初步評估申請資格。

醫管局會善用市民在社福和其他政府資助計劃下已確認的經濟審查資格，作為醫管局處理費用豁免申請的參考，務求各種安排及處理程序盡量清晰簡便。醫管局亦會逐步電子化評估過程，在今年年底讓申請人透過手機應用程式HA Go查閱申請進度及上傳文件等，目標在明年第三季可在網上進行申請程序。

發言人補充：「醫管局於十一月起設立專責隊伍，確保其下各公立醫院收到的醫療費用減免申請獲得適時處理。」

此外，在公營醫療收費改革明年一月生效後，東華三院將會繼續肩負救病拯危的使命，為有需要人士提供免費門診服務。符合資格人士於東華東院、東華醫院及廣華醫院的門診服務求診將會繼續獲豁免繳付以下費用：


家庭醫學診所（不包括綜合診所）的診治及處方藥物費用（適用於所有符合資格人士）
專科門診診所（不包括綜合診所及專職醫療診所）的診治費用（只適用於年齡為75歲或以上，或12歲或以下的符合資格人士）


此外，醫管局今日已於政府憲報刊登非符合資格人士、公立醫院非資助服務及公營醫療服務餘下個別項目的收費檢討，有關收費將於二○二六年一月一日起正式生效。非符合資格人士的收費將根據二○二三至二四年度服務成本水平調整，而非資助服務收費將按收回成本的原則並參考市場價格調整。這些服務不會獲得公帑資助。醫管局亦為一些其他醫院行政費用（例如證明書及醫療報告、影印費和殮房收費等）進行調整。醫管局新收費安排已列於附表。"

  Compared with the grading released last week, Clear Water Bay First Beach, Clear Water Bay Second Beach, Hoi Mei Wan Beach and Ma Wan Tung Wan Beach have been upgraded from Grade 2 to Grade 1.

  Under the present grading system, beaches are classified into four grades, namely Good (Grade 1), Fair (Grade 2), Poor (Grade 3) and Very Poor (Grade 4), according to the level of E. coli in the water. Grades are calculated on the basis of the geometric mean of the E. coli counts on the five most recent sampling occasions.

  While the ratings represent the general water quality at the beaches, an EPD spokesman reminded members of the public that water quality could be temporarily affected during and after periods of heavy rain. Bathers should avoid swimming at beaches for up to three days after a tropical cyclone or heavy rainfall.

  A summary of beach grades is published weekly before the weekend. The latest beach grades based on the most current data may be obtained from the EPD's website on Beach Water Quality (www.epd.gov.hk/epd/beach) or the beach hotline, 2511 6666. Members of the public can also obtain the latest daily water quality forecast information for all beaches that are open for swimming through the EPD's dedicated webpage on the beach water quality forecast (www.epd.gov.hk/en/BWQForecast).

CE attends APEC meetings in Korea (with photos/videos),2025-10-31 15:56,2025-10-31 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100526.htm,"   The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, continued his visit to Korea today (October 31) to participate in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) activities and meet with leaders from Singapore, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

 In the morning, Mr Lee participated in the APEC Economic Leaders' Informal Dialogue with Guests to exchange views with leaders of other economies on issues that included promoting trade and investment and fostering public-private collaboration to respond to global challenges. In his remarks, he stated that in the face of global economic uncertainties, enhancing trade and investment co-operation is a critical driver of economic growth and development. Highlighting Hong Kong's position as the world's freest economy and its internationalised and market-oriented business environment, Mr Lee said that the city will continue to actively uphold the rules-based multilateral trading system and promote regional economic co-operation in developing an open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community.

 Afterwards, Mr Lee met with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, the UAE, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Noting that the UAE and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states are Hong Kong's important partners in the Middle East and key links in China's Belt and Road Initiative, Mr Lee said that Hong Kong attaches importance to forging closer economic and trade relations with the GCC member states. He said that he was pleased to see the continued increase in economic and trade collaboration between the two places since his visit to the UAE in 2023, adding that the two governments are actively promoting co-operation in such key domains as investment, finance and technology. With the resumption of direct flights between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi in November, he expected the two places to further strengthen their economic and trade co-operation, people-to-people exchanges and diversified development. Mr Lee said that Hong Kong's simple and low tax regime provides an excellent business environment and encouraged more talent, businesses and capital from the UAE and the Middle East to establish a presence in the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, seizing the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area's development potential in innovation and technology.

 In the afternoon, Mr Lee attended the APEC Business Advisory Council Dialogue with APEC Economic Leaders. Hong Kong, China's representatives to the APEC Business Advisory Council, Ms Mary Huen and Mr Geoffrey Kao, were also present.

 Mr Lee also met with the Managing Director of the IMF, Ms Kristalina Georgieva. Mr Lee thanked the IMF for consistently reaffirming Hong Kong's status as an international financial centre and recognising Hong Kong's robust institutional framework, ample policy buffers, and the smooth functioning of the Linked Exchange Rate System. He said that as one of the world's three major financial centres, Hong Kong will harness the asset-reallocation wave of global investors to continuously reform its capital markets, facilitate corporate fundraising, enhance market liquidity and promote financial innovation prudently, thereby fostering the sustainable development of the financial services industry.

 Afterwards, Mr Lee met with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lawrence Wong. Mr Lee noted that Singapore is Hong Kong's fourth-largest trading partner and its largest merchandise trading partner within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, reflecting the close economic and trade ties between the two places. He emphasised that Hong Kong enjoys the dual advantage of having national and global opportunities under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and is fully committed to deepening international exchanges and co-operation. He welcomed Singaporean enterprises to leverage Hong Kong's roles as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" by investing in the city's Northern Metropolis, thereby strengthening co-operation in frontier technology fields and tapping into the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area's vast market potential. He also thanked Singapore for its consistent support for Hong Kong's early accession to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

 In the evening, Mr Lee will attend a Gala Dinner hosted by the organiser for participating leaders and enjoy cultural performances.

 Mr Lee will attend the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting Retreat tomorrow (November 1)."
HKMA and Cyberport cohost GenA.I. Symposium to share outcomes of GenA.I. Sandbox,2025-10-31 15:30,2025-10-31 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100287.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:

  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), in collaboration with the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited (Cyberport), hosted the Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenA.I.) Symposium today (October 31). The event provided a platform for GenA.I. Sandbox participants to share their insights and showcase their GenA.I. innovations through interactive exhibition booths, fostering industry collaboration and knowledge exchange.

  The Symposium attracted over 500 practitioners from the banking, insurance and technology sectors, featuring panel discussions with leaders from regulatory bodies, industry association (Note), banks, consultancy firms, and technology firms, who deliberated on the latest developments in GenA.I. and their implications for the financial sector. The event also included fireside chat sessions with virtual avatars discussing future models of co-operation between banking professionals and A.I.. To underscore the topic, the event was powered by A.I. live transcription and translation services and an interactive A.I. photo booth for personalised digital memorabilia.

  At the Symposium, the HKMA also presented the Report on the First Cohort of GenA.I. Sandbox. The report summarises key findings from the first cohort, demonstrating GenA.I.'s significant potential to add value in banking, particularly in enhancing risk management, anti-fraud capabilities and customer experience. It also shares technical learnings from trials at Cyberport's Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre, offering the industry practical guidance on key areas such as model fine-tuning and guardrail implementation for building safer and domain-specific GenA.I. solutions.

  The HKMA unveiled a pilot GenA.I. chatbot to provide users with more interactive access to insights and practical guidance from the Sandbox. The chatbot explores the feasibility of deploying a knowledge-bound GenA.I. solution that addresses common concerns such as hallucinations and inaccuracies.

  The Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, said, ""The first cohort of the GenA.I. Sandbox has explored numerous innovative use cases, providing the banking industry with valuable insights into how A.I. can deliver tangible value for both banks and consumers. The insights have also guided the initiation of Project Noor, in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub and other like-minded regulators, with an aim to develop an explainable A.I. toolkit. We look forward to the second cohort, which will further advance the responsible adoption of GenA.I. to future-proof banking services.""

研討會吸引超過500位來自銀行、保險及科技業界人士出席，舉行多場專題討論，由監管機構、行業協會（註）、金融機構、顧問公司及科技企業代表深入探討GenA.I.發展趨勢與金融業應用前景，更設與A.I.虛擬人物的對話環節，探討銀行從業員與A.I.未來「人機協作」的模式。為呼應主題，是次研討會採用A.I.技術提供即時傳譯及轉錄，並設有互動A.I.拍照亭，為與會者創作專屬的數碼紀念品。

金管局在會上發表《第一期GenA.I.沙盒報告》，總結沙盒的成功經驗，顯示GenA.I.技術在提升風險管理、詐騙防範及客戶體驗等範疇均有龐大潛力。報告同時整合銀行在數碼港人工智能超算中心進行的技術測試成果，就模型微調、安全防護欄設置等關鍵技術環節提供實務指引，協助業界建構更安全、更貼近業務需求的GenA.I.解決方案。

金管局也向業界展示其推出的實驗性GenA.I.聊天機器人，讓用戶透過互動方式獲取沙盒洞見和實務指引，並探討如何利用具知識邊界的GenA.I.系統，應對內容幻覺與資訊誤差等常見問題。

金管局總裁余偉文表示：「第一期GenA.I.沙盒成功探索多項創新用例，就人工智能如何為銀行及客戶帶來實際價值，提供了重要參考。探索成果也促成金管局與國際清算銀行創新樞紐，以及其他有共同理念的監管機構合作，啟動Noor項目，以研發一套可解釋的A.I.工具。我們期待第二期沙盒計劃進一步推動GenA.I.的負責任應用，為銀行服務未來發展奠定堅實基礎。」

Bidders for LNY fair stalls must be at least 18 years old and ordinarily reside in Hong Kong.

Anyone can bid for more than one stall. A bidder must pay the bid price and register in person with his or her own name as the licensee of the stall immediately after successfully bidding for a stall. The bidder is also required to sign at once a licence agreement with the FEHD, or he/she will forfeit the rights to operate the stall.

All fair sites will be made available to the licensees three days in advance of the fairs (from February 8 to 10, 2026) for the setting up of stalls. In the event of any unforeseeable incident that will cause reduction of the whole licence period (including the duration for setting up stalls and the business period of the fair), the Government has the right to postpone the commencement date and shorten the duration of the period. The bidding price (licence fee) paid will be refunded to the successful bidder on a pro-rata basis without interest.

Stall licensees must completely remove the stall structure and all paraphernalia, together with all refuse, debris and unsold commodities (whether damaged or otherwise) from the licensed area before 7am on February 17, 2026.

The FEHD reminded licensees that the stalls are solely for the purpose of selling and promoting the sale of the permitted commodities, and no other activities are allowed in the licensed area. If the FEHD considers that any activity conducted by the licensee to publicise, promote, display, show or sell any permitted commodities in the venue is unlawful, contrary to the interest of national security, immoral or incompatible with the object of the LNY fair, the FEHD is entitled to direct the licensee to stop conducting such activity and the licensee must immediately comply with such direction.

Stall licensees should not destroy, damage or abandon any unsold commodities at or in the vicinity of the stall. They may surrender unsold flowers and plants left behind at the stall to the FEHD at no charge, cost or compensation whatsoever, before 7am on February 17, 2026.

According to the licence agreement, except inside designated stalls, licensees must not keep, store or use any compressed helium cylinder in the licensed area. Whereas licensees of the designated stalls may keep, store or use helium cylinders in the licenced area, the quantity of helium should be such that a licence is not required pursuant to the Dangerous Goods (Application and Exemption) Regulation 2012 (Cap. 295E), i.e. equivalent to 150 litres of helium. Sales of floating LED glowing balloons and aquarium fish by stall licensees are prohibited at the LNY fairs.

In addition, as stated in the licence agreement, the height of dry goods stalls must not exceed 3 metres from ground level. The height of wet goods stalls and fast food stalls must not exceed 4.5m from ground level. For wet goods stalls and fast food stalls with a height of more than 3m from ground level, the licensee must, at his own costs, provide the FEHD with the original certificate issued by an authorised person, a registered structural engineer, or a competent person under the Construction Sites (Safety) Regulations (Cap. 59I) to certify the structural safety of the structure in the licensed area before the fair is opened to the public. The licensee must also affix a copy of the aforesaid certificate on the structure of the stall. Also, each corner and anchor point of the marquee (if any) shall be securely fastened using appropriate ballast weights, such as sandbags or purpose-designed marquee water weights. During the period when the Strong Monsoon Signal is in force or to be issued, the licensee shall immediately inspect the stall and adopt reinforcement measures as necessary.

Successful bidders shall comply with all the stipulations and provisions as set out in the licence agreement. Otherwise, the FEHD is entitled to terminate the agreement and the licensee shall immediately vacate the stall.

Details of the 2026 LNY fairs such as the public notice, the locations and layouts of the fair venues, commodities allowed for sale at the fair stalls, open auction arrangements and related rules, and a sample of the licence agreement are available on the FEHD website (www.fehd.gov.hk).

​為方便營商和促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象，政府於二○二二年六月推出「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月恆常化為短期訪客計劃。截至二○二五年九月底，先導計劃／短期訪客計劃已惠及超過38000名非本地人才，便利他們來港參與各項短期活動，包括新春國際匯演之夜、亞洲金融論壇、香港國際七人欖球賽、香港演藝博覽等盛事。計劃促進更多人才訪港交流，助力香港在「一國兩制」下積極發揮「超級聯繫人」的角色。

經檢視後，政府決定進一步擴大計劃以涵蓋「環境」、「職業安全與健康」、「海事」、「智庫」及「其他」五個新界別，以及在七個原有界別增加認可機構及指定短期活動，詳情見附件。當中，政府將增設「其他」界別，讓相關決策局／部門在有需要時可透過計劃邀請非本地人才來港參加其舉辦、合辦及／或支持的活動，為短期訪客計劃注入更大靈活性，有助便利更多非本地人才來港交流。計劃擴展後的其他安排不變。

​短期訪客計劃擴大後，將涵蓋以下十七個界別共約490個認可機構：


醫療衞生；
高等教育；
文化藝術；
體育；
文物；
創意產業；
創新及科技；
香港桂冠論壇；
航空；
國際╱大型活動；
金融；

Expansion of Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors announced,2025-10-31 15:00,2025-10-31 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100353.htm,"With effect from tomorrow (November 1), the Government will expand the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme), enabling more non-local talent to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits. Following a review, in addition to the existing 12 designated sectors, the STV Scheme will be expanded to cover five new sectors, with the addition of more authorised organisations and specified short-term activities.

With a view to facilitating business, promoting development of relevant sectors and raising Hong Kong's international profile, the Government launched the Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, which was regularised as the STV Scheme in June2024. As of end-September 2025, the Pilot Scheme/STV Scheme had benefited over 38000 non-local talent, enabling their entry into Hong Kong as visitors to participate in various short-term activities, including the International Chinese New Year Night Parade, the Asian Financial Forum, the Hong Kong Sevens, the Hong Kong Performing Arts Expo and other major events. The STV Scheme enables more talent to visit Hong Kong for exchanges, giving full play to Hong Kong's strength as a ""super connector"" under the ""one country, two systems"" framework.

Upon review, the Government decided to further expand the STV Scheme to cover five new sectors, namely ""Environment"", ""Occupational Safety and Health"", ""Maritime"", ""Think Tanks"" and ""Others"", with the addition of more authorised organisations and specified short-term activities in seven existing sectors. For more details, please refer to the Annex. Among them, the Government will introduce the ""Others"" sector, enabling relevant policy bureaux/departments to invite non-local talent to come to Hong Kong under the scheme to participate in events or activities they host, cohost and/or support as necessary. This will inject greater flexibility into the STV Scheme, thereby helping more non-local talent to visit Hong Kong for exchanges. Other arrangements will remain unchanged after the expansion.

The expanded STV Scheme will cover the following 17 sectors with a total of some-490 authorised organisations:


Medical and Healthcare;
Higher Education;
Arts and Culture;
Sports;
Heritage;
Creative Industries;
Innovation and Technology;
The Hong Kong Laureate Forum;
Aviation;
International/Mega events;
Finance;
Development and Construction;
Environment;
Occupational Safety and Health;
Maritime;
Think Tanks; and
Others.


âUnder the STV Scheme, organisations authorised by relevant government bureaux/departments can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talent in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong and participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the Immigration Department (ImmD). Participation of the non-local talent in specified activities in Hong Kong must be conducive to economic development or achieving relevant policy objectives, without displacing the local workforce. They may participate in the specified short-term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days upon each arrival, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned. Through an established mechanism, all participating bureaux/departments would assist in ensuring that the implementation of the scheme consistently meets relevant policy objectives and will neither displace the local workforce nor constitute a risk of abuse (including illegal employment).

For more information on the STV Scheme, please visit the ImmD's website (www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/stv.html)."

勞工及福利局局長在第九屆環球大灣區可持續發展經貿高峰論壇主題演講致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-31 14:35,2025-10-31 15:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100210.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十月三十一日）上午在第九屆環球大灣區可持續發展經貿高峰論壇主題演講的視像致辭全文：

各位來賓、各位朋友：

大家好。很高興再次獲邀擔任今日第九屆環球大灣區可持續發展經貿高峰論壇的演講嘉賓，以視像方式和大家分享交流。

今次論壇以「全球鏈接·蓄勢騰飛」為主題，與特區政府招攬國際人才的目標不謀而合。

香港作為內地與國際之間的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，正全力連接全球資源、市場與人才，推動長遠經濟發展。

要維持這個龐大齒輪運轉，展現香港在國家戰略與全球經濟格局中的潛力，核心關鍵正是招攬匯聚全球高端人才。

德國創科人才之旅體現策略性招攬

最近我認識的一班來自德國的年輕朋友，正體現到香港如何有策略地吸引國際高端人才。

今年六月，我與香港人才服務辦公室（人才辦）團隊一同到德國慕尼黑舉辦創科創業提案大賽，選出12名得獎的創科人才，他們既擁有創業和技術頭腦，而且非常年輕，一半屬於「00後」，但他們早已設立與創科相關的公司。

人才辦在九月邀請了他們親身到香港和深圳考察，探索區內的創科生態、行業支援和創業機遇，了解大灣區內的產業鏈互補與協同，吸引他們前來香港乃至大灣區發展。

在我和他們交流時，他們都分享了行程中所見所聞，認為這次行程大有得着，對香港優勢及大灣區潛力印象深刻，更有朋友計劃來港發展，考慮落戶科學園，為事業發展開拓新一頁。

由此可見，香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，能夠發揮針對性的策略以招攬高端人才。正如這次為德國年青創科人才提供親身感受、眼見為實的機會，讓他們具體掌握來港以至到大灣區發展的龐大潛力。

香港的國際成就與最新人才情況

今年九月，國際管理發展學院發布《2025年世界人才排名》，香港的排名大幅躍升至全球第四位，並位列亞洲首位。而「深圳—香港—廣州」創新集群亦獲世界知識產權組織評選為全球第一，這些都反映香港對人才的吸引力及大灣區的創新能力獲得國際高度肯定。

這些成就是特區政府過去一段時間全力推動吸引人才的成果。自二○二二年年底起，特區政府推行多項搶人才、留人才措施。截至今年八月，已成功吸引逾23萬名來自全球不同界別的人才來港工作和發展。他們的加入不僅提升行業競爭力，也促進知識轉移及創新發展，形成良好的行業循環。

然而，要讓這些人才真正扎根香港，發揮長遠效益，做好全球推廣以外，更需要完善的落戶及融入支援。這正是人才辦的核心任務。

人才辦的工作

人才辦過去兩年積極在全球重點市場推廣，配合「八大中心」發展，招攬相關專業人才來港發展，豐富本地人才庫，並為行業帶來國際化的視野。

過去兩年，人才辦進行了70次海內外訪問，到訪歐洲、亞洲、澳洲、中東及北美洲地區國家，並與大學、行業協會及初創機構建立「朋友圈」，實時推送香港最新資訊。

招才以外，留才亦很重要。人才辦成立兩年以來，肩負為來港人才作指路人的角色，已連繫90多個不同界別的指定合作夥伴，為人才來港後面對的求職、創業及子女教育等不同問題提供專業意見及支援。人才辦亦持續舉辦線上線下專題研討會、粵語學習班、招聘會和社區共融活動，協助人才盡快適應新生活。

剛過去的中秋節，人才辦邀請了一群來港人才參與在灣仔藍屋的節慶活動，手繪燈籠及擔任義工，與本地街坊融洽相處，加深他們對社區的認識。未來我們會繼續鼓勵人才參與義工活動，協助他們更好地融入香港。

總結

香港為人才提供機遇，人才也為香港帶來發展動能。未來特區政府會繼續做好引才、留才、育才、用才的工作，透過高效而聚焦的方法，與大灣區城市深化合作，推動人才共引、共享、共育，實現人才互聯互通、協同發展，為國家、大灣區和香港建立優質和多元的人才庫，推動國家經濟高質量發展。

最後，我祝願今日活動取得圓滿成功。

謝謝大家。"
Social welfare sector rallies with unity in support of Legislative Council General Election (with photos/video),2025-10-31 14:23,2025-10-31 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100288.htm,"The Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Social Welfare Department (SWD) jointly organised a mobilisation event today (October 31) to call for the concerted support of the social welfare sector for the 2025 Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election. Appeals were made for social welfare practitioners to stand for the election or cast their votes to elect visionary, responsible and dedicated Members to the geographical and functional constituencies of the LegCo.

Officiated by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun; the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Alice Lau; the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To; and the Chairperson of the Social Workers Registration Board, Mr Herman Hui, the mobilisation event was joined by representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating subsidised welfare services or other SWD subvented services, demonstrating the unity of the social welfare sector and its commitment to Hong Kong's future development. There were over 310 participants in the event.

Mr Sun said in his speech that the LegCo is one of the key pillars in the governance structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). After improving the electoral system of the HKSAR and the full implementation of the ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" principle, the operation of the LegCo has been back on the right track. Over the past term of office, the LegCo interacted with the HKSAR Government with high efficiency in fulfilling their respective duties. Multiple important bills relating to welfare were scrutinised and passed, covering elderly care, poverty alleviation and support for the disadvantaged, etc. They have enabled the Government to take forward more effective policies and allowed vulnerable groups to be better protected. Mr Sun strongly called upon prospective candidates from the social welfare sector to stand for the election, bringing in their expertise and valuable experiences to the LegCo. He also urged all to cast their votes, joining the Government to build a better future for Hong Kong.

Ms Lau said the Government understood that some elderly persons may have difficulties in casting their votes due to impaired mobility and intensive care needs. The LWB and SWD will continue to urge NGOs to offer convenient arrangements this year for enabling elderly persons and their families to vote.

Speaking at the event, Mr To encouraged NGOs in the social welfare sector to proactively put in place assistance arrangements for their employees to fulfil their civic responsibility, casting votes for their desired candidates as a voice for the social welfare sector and Hong Kong.

Mr Hui remarked that the smooth and timely passage of the Social Workers Registration (Amendment) Bill 2024 was attributed to the high efficiency of the legislative process. He called on all practitioners to participate in the LegCo General Election on December 7. He said he believes that the social welfare functional constituency will continue to be a key platform for reflecting the views of the sector and protecting the interests of vulnerable groups.

In responding to the call, participating chief executives and representatives of social welfare organisations all pledged to fully support the LegCo General Election. They also shared their assistance arrangements for their employees, such as flexible working hours and transport support, exchanging their experiences and insights on how to better encourage on-duty staff and service users to participate in the election.

The eighth-term LegCo General Election will be held on December 7. A total of 90 LegCo Members consisting of 30 from the functional constituencies will be elected, whereas the social welfare sector will hold one key place. Citizens may visit the election website (www.elections.gov.hk) to learn more about the LegCo General Election and vote for LegCo Members of the new term on the polling day."

活動由勞福局局長孫玉菡聯同勞福局常任秘書長劉焱、社署署長杜永恒和社會工作者註冊局主席許宗盛主持起動儀式，營辦津助福利服務或其他社署資助服務的非政府機構代表均響應出席，體現社福界的團結以及對香港未來發展的承擔。參與活動的人數超過310人。

孫玉菡致辭時表示，立法會是香港特別行政區（特區）管治架構中的重要支柱，特區完善選舉制度後，全面落實「愛國者治港」原則，立法會運作重回正軌。在過去一屆的立法會任期內，特區政府行政機關和立法機關各司其職，高效互動，完成審議多項與民生福祉相關的重要法案，涵蓋安老、扶貧、助弱等範疇，讓政府施政更到位，讓弱勢社群得到更有力的保障。他強力呼籲社福界的有志之士積極參選，將專業知識和寶貴經驗帶入議會，同工亦須踴躍選賢與能，與政府同心同德共創未來。

劉焱表示政府留意到社區內不少長者因行動不便或需要照顧而難以投票，勞福局和社署今年會繼續邀請非政府機構為長者及其家庭提供各種便利安排，積極協助長者投票。

杜永恒亦鼓勵社福界非政府機構積極採取措施便利員工履行公民責任，鼓勵員工選出心目中的理想代表，為社福界及香港建言。

許宗盛致辭時表示，《2024年社會工作者註冊（修訂）條例草案》得以適時順利通過，有賴立法會在審議過程中展現的高效率。他呼籲大家全情投入參與十二月七日舉行的立法會換屆選舉，而社福界功能界別將繼續成為反映業界意見、維護弱勢社群利益的重要平台。

參與活動的社福機構總幹事和代表皆表示會響應號召，全力支持立法會換屆選舉。他們亦於活動中分享機構的便利安排，例如彈性上班時間和交通支援等，並就如何更好地鼓勵當值員工和服務使用者參與投票，交流經驗和灼見。

第八屆立法會選舉將於十二月七日舉行，屆時將選出90名立法會議員，包括功能界別30名，其中社福界佔有重要一席。市民可瀏覽選舉網站（www.elections.gov.hk），了解是次立法會選舉的相關資料，於投票日選出新一屆立法會議員。"

劉焱表示政府留意到社區內不少長者因行動不便或需要照顧而難以投票，勞福局和社署今年會繼續邀請非政府機構為長者及其家庭提供各種便利安排，積極協助長者投票。

杜永恒亦鼓勵社福界非政府機構積極採取措施便利員工履行公民責任，鼓勵員工選出心目中的理想代表，為社福界及香港建言。

許宗盛致辭時表示，《2024年社會工作者註冊（修訂）條例草案》得以適時順利通過，有賴立法會在審議過程中展現的高效率。他呼籲大家全情投入參與十二月七日舉行的立法會換屆選舉，而社福界功能界別將繼續成為反映業界意見、維護弱勢社群利益的重要平台。

參與活動的社福機構總幹事和代表皆表示會響應號召，全力支持立法會換屆選舉。他們亦於活動中分享機構的便利安排，例如彈性上班時間和交通支援等，並就如何更好地鼓勵當值員工和服務使用者參與投票，交流經驗和灼見。

Social welfare sector rallies with unity in support of Legislative Council General Election,2025-10-31 14:23,2025-10-31 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100288.htm,"The Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the Social Welfare Department (SWD) jointly organised a mobilisation event today (October 31) to call for the concerted support of the social welfare sector for the 2025 Legislative Council (LegCo) General Election. Appeals were made for social welfare practitioners to stand for the election or cast their votes to elect visionary, responsible and dedicated Members to the geographical and functional constituencies of the LegCo.

Officiated by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun; the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Alice Lau; the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To; and the Chairperson of the Social Workers Registration Board, Mr Herman Hui, the mobilisation event was joined by representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating subsidised welfare services or other SWD subvented services, demonstrating the unity of the social welfare sector and its commitment to Hong Kong's future development. There were over 310 participants in the event.

Mr Sun said in his speech that the LegCo is one of the key pillars in the governance structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). After improving the electoral system of the HKSAR and the full implementation of the ""patriots administering Hong Kong"" principle, the operation of the LegCo has been back on the right track. Over the past term of office, the LegCo interacted with the HKSAR Government with high efficiency in fulfilling their respective duties. Multiple important bills relating to welfare were scrutinised and passed, covering elderly care, poverty alleviation and support for the disadvantaged, etc. They have enabled the Government to take forward more effective policies and allowed vulnerable groups to be better protected. Mr Sun strongly called upon prospective candidates from the social welfare sector to stand for the election, bringing in their expertise and valuable experiences to the LegCo. He also urged all to cast their votes, joining the Government to build a better future for Hong Kong.

Ms Lau said the Government understood that some elderly persons may have difficulties in casting their votes due to impaired mobility and intensive care needs. The LWB and SWD will continue to urge NGOs to offer convenient arrangements this year for enabling elderly persons and their families to vote.

Speaking at the event, Mr To encouraged NGOs in the social welfare sector to proactively put in place assistance arrangements for their employees to fulfil their civic responsibility, casting votes for their desired candidates as a voice for the social welfare sector and Hong Kong.

Mr Hui remarked that the smooth and timely passage of the Social Workers Registration (Amendment) Bill 2024 was attributed to the high efficiency of the legislative process. He called on all practitioners to participate in the LegCo General Election on December 7. He said he believes that the social welfare functional constituency will continue to be a key platform for reflecting the views of the sector and protecting the interests of vulnerable groups.

In responding to the call, participating chief executives and representatives of social welfare organisations all pledged to fully support the LegCo General Election. They also shared their assistance arrangements for their employees, such as flexible working hours and transport support, exchanging their experiences and insights on how to better encourage on-duty staff and service users to participate in the election.

The eighth-term LegCo General Election will be held on December 7. A total of 90 LegCo Members consisting of 30 from the functional constituencies will be elected, whereas the social welfare sector will hold one key place. Citizens may visit the election website (www.elections.gov.hk) to learn more about the LegCo General Election and vote for LegCo Members of the new term on the polling day."

Implementation details of Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles,2025-10-31 12:47,2025-10-31 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100311.htm,"  The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (October 31) announced the implementation details of Southbound Travel for Guangdong Vehicles (Southbound Travel Scheme).

  Under the Southbound Travel Scheme, eligible and approved private cars from Guangdong (Guangdong vehicles) may park (the vehicles do not enter Hong Kong) at the automated carparks on the artificial island at the Hong Kong Port (port carparks) via the Zhuhai Port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge (HZMB), after which the drivers and passengers may transfer to a flight via Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) or enter and visit Hong Kong by taking Hong Kong local transportation; or they may enter Hong Kong directly via the HZMB and drive to the urban area without obtaining a regular quota (entry into urban area).

  The Guangdong and Hong Kong governments agreed that the ""Park & Fly"" carpark of the port carparks will be open for application starting from 9am on November 1 this year, and will commence operations starting from 0.00am on November 15; whereas entry into the urban area will be open for application starting from 9am on December 9, and the approved Guangdong vehicles will enter Hong Kong via the HZMB starting from 0:00am on December 23.

  The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the staunch support of the Central Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government in jointly taking forward and realising the Southbound Travel Scheme. This dual-track arrangement with Northbound Travel for Hong Kong Vehicles (Northbound Travel Scheme) will inject greater impetus for the integrated development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

  ""The Southbound Travel Scheme and the Northbound Travel Scheme complement each other and are important measures to promote the integrated development of the GBA. Not only do they facilitate mutual engagement between residents of Guangdong and Hong Kong, but they also achieve a higher level of mutual flow of people and goods and even open up a new model for Mainland residents to visit Hong Kong, which in turn brings opportunities to such sectors as tourism, retail, and catering in Hong Kong. Under the strategies of ensuring safety, effective diversion, well-equipped supporting facilities and streamlined application, the HKSAR Government is taking forward the Southbound Travel Scheme in a steady manner, with a view to benefitting Hong Kong residents and society as a whole, as well as sharing the fruitful achievements of the integrated development of the GBA,"" Mr Lee said.

  Travellers under the Southbound Travel Scheme are expected to be high-spending individuals and families. The HKSAR Government will provide participants with tourist parking guides, including information on tourism and carparks, with a view to facilitating their itinerary planning, guiding them to combine self-driving and public transportation, spend and stay for a few days in Hong Kong, and choose itineraries relating to culture, sports, exhibition, shopping and theme park according to their preferences, which will in turn considerably contribute to boosting Hong Kong's economy.

  The Guangdong Provincial Government announced today the regulations for the port carparks and entry into the urban area under the Southbound Travel Scheme, including detailed eligibility requirements for applicants, vehicles and drivers, insurance regulations, port clearance and requirements for driving on the roads, procedures, and mechanisms for handling non-compliance. For details, please refer to the official websites of the Guangdong Provincial Government.

  To ensure orderly implementation, both parts of the Southbound Travel Scheme will initially be open to applications from four cities in Guangdong Province (namely Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, and Jiangmen), to be gradually extended to other cities in Guangdong Province after six months.

Port carparks

  As part of the Southbound Travel Scheme, the automated ""Park & Fly""carpark of the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) will be officially commissioned, providing a new experience for cross-boundary self-drive travellers who transfer to a flight. The ""Park & Fly"" carpark will provide 1 800 parking spaces, allowing 24-hour automated parking and drop-off/pick-up services.

  The AAHK has launched a one-stop booking platform, allowing eligible applicants from Guangdong to book a parking space for each trip on a first-come, first-served basis. Applicants are required to submit information on their designated driver and all accompanying flight transfer passengers, including identification documents and travel documents, vehicle details, scheduled travelling dates, and valid air tickets. They are also required to prepay the relevant parking fees and take out third-party risk insurance policies in advance. The submitted application details will be forwarded to the relevant Mainland authorities for approval and record. Upon completion of processing, the system will confirm the booking with applicants. Each applicant and his/her vehicle may make a booking for one of the following services per day, namely ""park and fly"", drop-off or pick-up. To provide convenience to travellers, the HKSAR Government has exempted southbound vehicles using the port carparks from the licensing and vehicle inspection requirements in accordance with the Road Traffic Ordinance (Cap. 374).

  Starting from November 15, vehicles with a successful booking can travel to and from the ""Park & Fly"" carpark via the HZMB, according to the booking confirmation notification. ""Park and fly"" travellers may park their vehicles using the automated parking system. Having their documents and air tickets verified, they will take a bonded bus to the SkyPier Terminal to check in with their baggage, and then proceed directly to the Terminal for boarding without going through Hong Kong immigration clearance in the process. Upon their return to Hong Kong, travellers will only need to confirm their booking at Transfer Desk E2 in the restricted area of ââTerminal 1 before proceeding to the SkyPier Terminal to take the bonded bus bound for the ""Park & Fly"" carpark to retrieve their vehicles. As for drop-off or pick-up, designated drivers may, in accordance with the respective booking, drive to the ""Park & Fly"" carpark to transfer to a flight, or from the ""Park & Fly"" carpark back to the Mainland, without having to use the automated parking system. All vehicles must enter and exit the carpark according to the designated routes. Signage has been added to the Hong Kong section of the HZMB to guide drivers to and from the ""Park & Fly"" carpark.

  For details regarding the eligibility, methods and procedures, as well as travel guidance for using the ""Park & Fly"" carpark, please visit the website of the AAHK's automated carpark online booking platform (autoparking.hkairport.com/).

Entry into urban area

  To better control the overall number of vehicles entering Hong Kong and provide a better travel experience, the Guangdong and Hong Kong governments have agreed to set a daily cap on the number of vehicles entering Hong Kong, starting with 100 vehicles per day for a stay of up to three days per Guangdong vehicle.

  Interested applicants must first register for a computer-based balloting through Guangdong's information platform of the Southbound Travel Scheme before formally submitting their applications starting from December 9. Applicants should allow time for completing various relevant procedures in accordance with the requirements of the Mainland and Hong Kong departments, including for designated drivers to hold a valid Hong Kong driving licence, their Guangdong vehicles to be inspected according to Hong Kong regulations to ensure compliance with Hong Kong requirements, and to have obtained valid third-party risk insurance, in order to complete the vehicle licensing application procedures. The validity period of the relevant licences for the Southbound Travel Scheme is up to one year.

  Applicants who have completed the above procedures may make bookings through the online travel booking system and, starting from December 23, travel to Hong Kong via the HZMB according to the successfully booked designated dates. If the number of booking registrations exceeds the booking quota, it will be allocated by computer-based balloting.

  For details regarding the application and booking for entry into the urban area, please visit the website of Guangdong's information platform, the Transport Department's dedicated webpage for the Southbound Travel Scheme (www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/licences_and_permits/southboundtravel/stfgveiua/index.html), and the dedicated webpage jointly developed by the Insurance Authority and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers (sbt.hkfi.org.hk/)."

各位社福界的朋友、同工：

大家好，十分感謝大家在短時間內、一呼百應，齊心出席今日「社會福利界全力支持2025立法會換屆選舉」的活動。十二月七日，距今只有約五個星期，香港特別行政區將舉行第八屆立法會選舉。我今日十分開心，可以與各位社福界同工，營辦津助服務的非政府機構代表、其他服務機構代表、社會工作者註冊局主席及成員，以及勞福局和社署同事一同參與今日這個意義重大的活動，不僅展現了社福界的團結，更體現了我們對香港未來發展的共同承擔。

立法會是香港特別行政區管治架構的重要支柱。回顧過去四年，第七屆立法會在行政主導和「愛國者治港」原則下，行政機關和立法機構有效良性互動，既相互制衡又相互配合，成績有目共睹。立法會在任期內審議通過法案近130條，較上屆同期超出百分之六十；立法會亦審批了260多個與發展和民生有關的撥款項目，項目總金額近7,000億元，當中有很多與社福界相關，涵蓋多個安老、扶貧等社福界關注的項目。

在第七屆立法會的成功實踐基礎上，今年十二月七日，香港將舉行第八屆立法會換屆選舉。這是完善選舉制度後的第二次立法會選舉，意義非凡。經完善的選舉制度，不但全面落實了「愛國者治港」原則，亦守護好香港的和諧穩定和市民的切身福祉。新選舉制度亦彰顯了制度本身的廣泛代表性、政治包容性、均衡參與性和公平參與的特點和優點，為香港民主長遠健康發展打下堅實的基礎。無論是地方選區或功能界別，我們都要選出有遠見、有擔當、有熱誠的賢能之士進入立法會，推動社會及社福界發展。

完善特區選舉制度後，立法會議員人數共90位，分別由選舉委員會選舉、功能界別選舉和地方選區選舉三大板塊產生。而社福界對立法會而言並不陌生，自一九八五年已經設立社福界功能界別，代表社福界功能界別的議員一直肩負反映業界意見、維護弱勢權益的重要角色。我在此鄭重呼籲社福界的有志之士積極考慮參選，憑藉大家的專業知識和對社福界別的深入了解，把推行社會服務、改善基層民生的寶貴經驗及專業意見帶入議會，為業界發聲，為香港建言。我亦十分期待可以與未來第八屆立法會的社福界功能界別議員攜手合作，為社福界做更多實事、好事。

《基本法》第二十六條訂明：「香港特別行政區永久性居民依法享有選舉權和被選舉權。」行使投票權是香港市民的權利，更是市民應有之舉。我們許多公共政策如醫療、勞工、教育、交通、住房等，均直接影響到普羅市民的日常生活和家庭福祉。在選舉中積極投票，讓我們認同的候選人為大家關心的事務發聲，直接關係到社會每位市民的切身福祉。

我衷心感謝所有受津助福利機構，以及其他受政府資助的服務營辦者，長期以來在社區默默耕耘，為不同年齡、不同需要的市民，提供專業和貼心的服務。正因為你們的努力與付出，香港的社會基礎更加穩固，社會的凝聚力不斷增強。香港正處於由治及興的關鍵階段，政府正全力深化改革、發展經濟、改善民生，立法會的工作極其重要。因此，我再一次強烈呼籲各位機構領袖和同工，在十二月七日投票日踴躍行使公民權利，履行公民責任，投下神聖的一票，行使各位的選擇權，支持有能力、有擔當的候選人成為業界及市民的代表。

不論各位手中有一票或兩票，無論是功能界別及／或地方選區，請大家必須積極投票，並主動宣傳、敦促上下所有員工參與，用好自己的公民權利，一盡自己公民應有的責任。因為你們的機構中每一位登記選民的每一票，也同樣重要。

讓我們攜手努力，一起支持立法會選舉，為香港良政善冶、經濟發展、民生福祉，踴躍投票。

「十二月七日，投入選舉，共創未來」!

謝謝大家。"
​「粵車南下」實施安排,2025-10-31 12:27,2025-10-31 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103000611.htm,"香港特別行政區政府今日（十月三十一日）公布「粵車南下」的實施安排。

在「粵車南下」安排下，符合條件並經核准的廣東私家車（粵車）可經港珠澳大橋珠海口岸前往香港口岸人工島上的自動化停車場（口岸停車場）泊車後（車輛不入境香港），司機和乘客經香港國際機場（香港機場）轉乘飛機或入境並轉乘香港本地交通工具訪港；或在無須取得常規配額下以自駕方式經大橋直接入境並駛至香港市區（入境市區部分）。

粵、港政府同意，口岸停車場的「轉機停車場」將於今年十一月一日上午九時起開始接受申請，並於十一月十五日凌晨零時起啓用；而入境市區部分將於十二月九日上午九時起開始接受申請，並於十二月二十三日凌晨零時起開始讓已獲批的廣東私家車經大橋入境香港。

行政長官李家超衷心感謝中央及廣東省政府一直以來的大力支持，共同推動和落實「粵車南下」。這安排將與「港車北上」雙軌並行，為粵港澳大灣區融合發展注入更大動能。

李家超說：「『粵車南下』與『港車北上』相輔相成，是推動粵港澳大灣區融合發展的重要舉措。這不僅促進粵港兩地居民『雙向奔赴』，實現更高水平的人流、物流互通，更同時開啓內地居民訪港新模式，為香港的旅遊、零售及餐飲等行業帶來機遇。特區政府正按照確保安全、有效分流、完備配套和簡便申請的策略，穩步推行『粵車南下』，讓香港居民和整體社會受惠，共同分享大灣區融合發展的豐碩成果。」

「粵車南下」的旅客預計是較高消費能力人士及家庭。特區政府會為參加者提供旅遊泊車指南包括旅遊和停車場資料，方便他們計劃行程，引導他們配搭自駕與公交、在港消費和住宿數天，按其所好選擇有關文化、體育、展覽、購物及主題樂園行程路線，對帶動本港經濟有相當助力。

廣東省政府已於今日公布「粵車南下」口岸停車場和入境市區部分的管理辦法，包括申請人、車輛及司機的詳細資格要求、保險規定、口岸通關和道路行駛要求、程序手續、違規違法處理機制等。詳情請留意廣東省人民政府官方網站。

為確保有序實施，「粵車南下」兩個部分均先開放予廣東省四個城市申請（即廣州、珠海、中山和江門），並計劃於半年後逐步推至廣東省其他城市。

口岸停車場

作為「粵車南下」的一部分，香港機場管理局（機管局）的自動化「轉機停車場」將正式啓用，為跨境自駕的轉機旅客提供新體驗。「轉機停車場」將24小時運作，提供約1 800個泊位，包括自動化泊位及送機／接機泊位。

​行政長官在第四屆粵港澳大灣區服務貿易大會開幕式致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-31 12:00,2025-10-31 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103000545.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月三十一日）在第四屆粵港澳大灣區服務貿易大會開幕式的視像致辭：

各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！我很高興以視頻方式參與第四屆粵港澳大灣區服務貿易大會開幕式。我首先熱烈祝賀大會順利舉行。

粵港澳大灣區是國家其中一個開放程度最高、經濟活力最強的區域，在國家發展大局中具有重要戰略地位。香港作為大灣區中心城市和區域發展核心引擎之一，我們不斷鞏固提升自身優勢，深化與大灣區不同城市互聯互通，為大灣區建設注入更強大的動能。

香港是國際金融、航運、貿易中心，全力打造國際高端人才集聚高地。我們擁有完善的法律制度、高度開放和國際化的營商環境，同時積極推動數字貿易、金融服務、法律服務等領域的創新，為大灣區發展提供多元化、高增值、全方位的專業支援。

在《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》，也就是CEPA框架下的《服務貿易協議》第二份修訂協議，已經在今年三月開始實施。香港提供不同優勢服務領域的企業，包括外國在港成立的公司，都可以通過協議的便利措施，更好服務大灣區市場。

我在上個月發表新一份《施政報告》，提出了多項措施，鞏固金融、航運、貿易及法律等服務領域的優勢，同時積極培育人工智能，以及數據科學等新興產業。

香港會繼續推動粵港澳三地規則銜接和機制對接，提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流。香港國際機場將聯同珠海機場優化「經珠港飛」服務，優化兩地機場的陸路連接，並將服務推廣至更多內地城市。另外，香港國際機場東莞空港中心的第一期永久設施將在今年底開始分階段完成，將大幅降低貨運成本。我們正積極推動第二期的研究，包括引進更多高增值物流和跨境電商設施，服務國家數字貿易的發展。

隨着全球貿易秩序重塑，很多內地企業的戰略重心已轉向積極開拓新興市場，分散營商風險及擴展業務。我在《施政報告》中提出的「內地企業出海專班」已正式成立，將為「出海」企業制訂多元方案，提供更全面、更大力度的支援。

我們積極對接大灣區專業服務與「一帶一路」機遇。香港金融管理局將與沙特阿拉伯公共投資基金合作，創立10億美元的投資基金，支持香港和其他大灣區企業「出海」到沙特阿拉伯。我們也會帶領更多中小企業前往東南亞市場開拓商機，支援企業「出海」需要。

「孤舉者難起，眾行者易趨」。我相信，這次大會將進一步凝聚力量，深化大灣區各城市在服務貿易領域的合作，共謀發展。香港也會繼續全力發揮內聯外通的優勢，為國家和大灣區高質量發展貢獻香港力量。

最後，我祝願本屆大會取得圓滿成功，各位工作愉快、身體健康！謝謝大家。"

It will advise the Government on the development of oral health and dental care, with a view to implementing the strategy that emphasises prevention, early identification, and timely intervention, thereby further enhancing both oral and general health of citizens of all ages.

  Oral health is an integral part of general health, and preventive oral care is a crucial component of primary healthcare. The Government released the final report of the Working Group on Oral Health and Dental Care and an action plan in December 2024, which includes adopting the strategy of widely promoting prevention-oriented primary oral healthcare among citizens across all age groups, and proposes the establishment of a steering and advisory framework, by setting up the Oral Health Group under the PHC Committee to continuously press ahead with various initiatives. Furthermore, the Chief Executive proposed to bolster public and subsidised dental services in his 2025 Policy Address to enhance oral health education, oral hygiene instructions, risk assessments, and more, in the community.

  Co-chaired by the Commissioner for Primary Healthcare, Dr Pang Fei-chau, and non-official member of the PHC Committee Dr Sigmund Leung, the Oral Health Group comprises four official members and 13 non-official members, with a term of office from November 1, 2025, to December 31, 2027. The non-official members include representatives from the dental profession, the healthcare sector, collaborating non-governmental organisations of government-subsidised dental care programmes, as well as prominent community figures. They possess rich experience and profound knowledge in relevant fields and can provide invaluable advice and recommendations to the Government on strategies for promoting oral health and the development of dental care services. The Oral Health Group will hold its first meeting in the fourth quarter of this year.

  Specifically, the terms of reference of the Oral Health Group are as follows:

(1) To monitor the progress of integrating oral health into primary healthcare;
(2) To monitor the effectiveness of various preventive measures in oral healthcare in attaining the Oral Health Goals for 2030; and
(3) To advise the Government on the further development of prevention-oriented oral healthcare, including the dental manpower supply and the development of eHealth for oral healthcare.

施家殷會長（粵港澳大灣區經貿協會榮譽會長及召集人）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。很高興以視頻方式，參與今日的論壇暨頒獎典禮。我首先恭賀所有獲獎企業和人士，期盼大家再接再厲，共同譜寫大灣區發展的新篇章。

習近平主席指出，要使粵港澳大灣區成為新發展格局的戰略支點、高質量發展的示範地、中國式現代化的引領地。香港是大灣區中心城市和區域發展核心引擎之一，在大灣區建設中積極推動區域合作，為國家進一步改革開放發揮灣區力量。

當前，地緣政治局勢持續緊張，環球經濟格局正在重塑。在這關鍵時刻，我們更要主動對接國家策略，積極融入國家發展大局，為經濟發展開拓更多新動能。今日論壇以「全球鏈接·蓄勢騰飛」為題，匯聚各界共同探討如何把握大灣區機遇，連繫全球，彰顯我們攜手並肩，以行動貢獻灣區發展的決心。

我們會創造出海機遇，強化雙向平台功能。我在上月發表新一份《施政報告》，提出多項革新舉措，全力推進粵港澳大灣區建設。全球對「中國製造」產品需求加大，內地企業不再聚焦單一國家，積極開拓新興市場。香港憑藉「一國兩制」下國家機遇和國際機遇的雙重疊加優勢，能在灣區發展中發揮「引進來、走出去」的重要雙向平台作用。政府已成立內地企業出海專班，主動吸引內地企業，借助香港出海，拓展國際業務，進一步鞏固香港作為國際商貿樞紐的地位。

我們會加強聯通共贏，釋放灣區澎湃活力。特區政府繼續深化粵港澳三地規則和機制對接，全力提升人流、物流、數據流、資金流，加強互利合作。我們會推進香港國際機場東莞空港中心發展，研究引入更多高增值物流和跨境電商設施，更好服務大灣區的貨運需求。我們亦會優化跨境徵信互通和深港跨境數據驗證平台，便利香港銀行向在港的內地居民及企業審批貸款，促進融資，推動經貿合作。

灣區騰飛，需要匯眾智，集眾力。大灣區經貿協會一直搭建高水平交流平台，積極建言獻策。我期待各位在今日論壇中深入交流，集思廣益，為大灣區建設貢獻智慧和力量。

我期望各位對灣區發展的熱誠，會成為建設香港的實際力量。第八屆立法會的選舉提名期已經展開，我呼籲所有愛國愛港、有抱負、有能力的人士積極參選。我也請各位市民與家人朋友，緊記在十二月七日踴躍投票，一起為香港選出賢能，共創美好未來。

最後，我祝願大灣區發展更上層樓，在座各位工作順利。多謝大家。"

Hong Kong Customs conducts joint enforcement operations with FEHD regarding sale of hairy crabs (with photos),2025-10-31 10:30,2025-10-31 10:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103000616.htm,"Hong Kong Customs and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) have been carrying out joint enforcement operations since Monday (October 27) to inspect hairy crab retail outlets in various districts, with the aim of protecting consumer rights and upholding food safety by ensuring hairy crabs on sale in the market comply with relevant stipulations and requirements under the laws.

  During the inspections, Customs officers and officers of the Centre for Food Safety and the Environmental Hygiene Branch of the FEHD monitored the sale of hairy crabs and also checked supporting documents for the place of origin and health certificates of the hairy crabs to ensure that the hairy crabs sold at retail shops are fit for human consumption and are in compliance with the Trade Descriptions Ordinance (TDO), the Food Safety Ordinance, and the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance.

  As of now, officers of the two departments have inspected 42 hairy crab retail shops, and no irregularity has been found. The relevant joint enforcement operations will continue.

  Apart from carrying out inspections in the market, Customs officers also made use of the big-data analytics system to analyse and verify whether online shops selling hairy crabs had complied with the TDO, with a view to safeguarding the interests of consumers when making online purchases.

  Customs attaches great importance to the protection of consumer rights and will take appropriate enforcement action once activities in violation of the TDO are detected in the market. The department also reminds traders not to apply a false trade description to goods or services, or to supply or offer to supply goods or services to which a false trade description is applied. Those who violate the TDO are liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

  The FEHD reminds traders that according to the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance, all food available for sale in Hong Kong, whether imported or locally produced, should be fit for human consumption. Also, any person who operates an unlicensed food business or sells restricted foods without permission is liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months. Under the Food Safety Ordinance, any person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to comply with the record-keeping requirement relating to movement of food commits an offence and is liable to a maximum fine of $10,000 and imprisonment for three months upon conviction.

  Customs and the FEHD remind traders not to import or put on sale hairy crabs with an unknown origin. Consumers should make purchases at reputable shops with the Shell Fish (Hairy Crab) Permit or relevant written permission granted by the FEHD.

  Members of the public may report any suspected violations of the TDO to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002) if they suspect that hairy crabs bought are of falsely claimed place of origin.

  In addition, if members of the public suspect that there are operators selling hairy crabs without the relevant permits/permissions or the hairy crabs are not accompanied by health certificates, they may file a report to the FEHD by calling the hotline at 2868 0000 or through email (enquiries@fehd.gov.hk)."

海關和食環署食物安全中心及環境衞生部人員除了監察大閘蟹的售賣情況外，在巡查時亦會查核大閘蟹的來源證明文件及衞生證明書，確保零售店鋪出售的大閘蟹適合供人食用，以及符合《商品說明條例》、《食物安全條例》及《公眾衞生及市政條例》的規定。

行動至今，兩個部門的人員已巡查42間大閘蟹零售店，暫時並未發現任何違法情況。有關聯合執法行動將會繼續進行。

海關人員除了在市面巡查，亦利用大數據系統分析和核實售賣大閘蟹的網店是否符合《商品說明條例》的規定，加強保障消費者在網上購物的權益。

海關十分重視保障消費者權益，如在市面發現任何涉嫌違反《商品說明條例》的活動，會立即採取相應的執法行動。海關提醒商戶不能將虛假商品說明應用於任何貨品或服務；或供應或要約供應已應用虛假商品說明的貨品或服務。如違反《商品說明條例》，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五十萬元及監禁五年。

食環署提醒商戶，根據《公眾衞生及市政條例》的規定，所有在香港出售的食物，不論進口或本地生產，必須適合供人食用；而任何人無牌經營食物業或未獲准許售賣限制出售的食物，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁六個月。而根據《食物安全條例》的規定，任何人如無合理辯解而沒有遵從備存食物進出紀錄的規定，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一萬元及監禁三個月。

海關及食環署提醒業界，切勿進口或售賣來歷不明的大閘蟹；而消費者亦應光顧信譽良好及領有食環署簽發的介貝類水產動物（大閘蟹）售賣許可證或相關書面准許的商戶。

市民如購入懷疑虛報產地的大閘蟹，可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑違反《商品說明條例》的事宜。

"Government launches open tender for first Smart Green Mass Transit System project ""Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak"" (with photo)",2025-10-31 09:30,2025-10-31 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103000346.htm,"The Government today (October 31) launches an open tender for the Smart and Green Mass Transit System in Kai Tak (Contract No. ED/2025/18). The closing time for tenders to be received is noon on July 3, 2026 (Friday).

The Smart and Green Mass Transit System (SGMTS) in Kai Tak (Kai Tak Project) is approximately 3.5 kilometres long with six stations. The termini will be connected to the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal and the MTR Kai Tak Station respectively. It will provide a convenient feeder transport service connecting the former runway area of Kai Tak to the MTR Kai Tak Station to strengthen connectivity among residential and commercial developments, tourism, culture and recreation, sports and community facilities within the area. The system is targeted to be commissioned in 2031.

A spokesperson for the Transport and Logistics Bureau said, ""The Kai Tak Project is the first SGMTS to be introduced in Hong Kong. To encourage participation of local, Mainland and overseas investors and operators, a Build-Operate-Transfer model is adopted for selecting a franchisee to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain the SGMTS in Kai Tak through an open tender. As the estimated profit from the operation of the SGMTS would not be able to cover the capital investment for construction and subsequent asset replacement, funding support will be provided through a transit-oriented development approach, where property development rights of three sites in the vicinity of the SGMTS would be granted to the future franchisee for holistic planning and development. Tenderers will be required to propose a fixed sum payable to the Government for the grant of the franchise and property development rights of the sites.""

The spokesperson further advised, ""A 'two-envelope approach' will be adopted in the tender assessment. A weighting of 60 per cent will be allocated to the assessment of the non-price proposal and 40 per cent to the price proposal. The Government will consider both the non-price and price proposals of the tenders comprehensively with a view to selecting the proposal which best fits the project intent. The detailed tender evaluation criteria are set out in the tender documents.""

Details of the tender notice are available on the Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD)'s website (www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/tender-notices/contracts/tender-notices/index.html). Relevant interested parties with the capability of delivering the project (including developers, contractors, system operators, system suppliers etc) can make a request for obtaining the tender documents through the Kai Tak Project's website of the CEDD (www.ktgts.hk). Tenderers must deposit their tenders in the tender box as specified in the tender notice before the tender closing time.

For enquiries, please contact the East Development Office of the CEDD at 3842 7087 during office hours."

FS concludes visit to Saudi Arabia (with photos/video),2025-10-31 09:00,2025-10-31 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/31/P2025103100082.htm,"The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, concluded the final day of his visit to Saudi Arabia yesterday (October 30, Riyadh time).

In the morning, Mr Chan met with the Governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), H.E. Mr Yasir Al-Rumayyan, to exchange views on deepening collaboration in the areas of investment and innovation and technology development between the two places. Mr Chan noted that over the past few years, Hong Kong and the PIF have built a solid foundation for co-operation across various sectors. He expressed hope that future collaboration can be further strengthened to contribute to the Belt and Road Initiative and support the development goals of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.

The visit yielded fruitful outcomes, including the signing of five agreements or memoranda of understanding (MoUs) between members of the Hong Kong delegation and local partners. These covered a wide range of areas, particularly innovation and technology and the digital economy. Mr Chan witnessed several of the signing ceremonies. Among them, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the Digital Cooperation Organization signed an MoU to promote the use of Hong Kong as a platform by start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from the organisation's member economies to access the Asia-Pacific market, while also supporting their digital transformation efforts.

In addition, three technology companies from Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland - specialising respectively in artificial intelligence, smart sensing technologies and robotics — signed strategic co-operation agreements or MoUs with Saudi enterprises. The agreements cover areas such as technology application, business development and scenario implementation, further promoting the deployment and advancement of innovative technologies in the Middle East. Separately, an environmental technology company also signed an MoU with a local construction firm to facilitate the wider application of its technologies in Saudi Arabia.

Mr Chan also led the Hong Kong delegation on a visit to the flagship urban development project in Riyadh, New Murabba. During the visit, Mr Chan met with the Chief Executive Officer of the New Murabba Development Company, Mr Michael Dyke, and attended a business exchange session between the company and the Hong Kong delegation.

Mr Chan remarked that Hong Kong possesses internationally recognised strengths in urban planning, architectural design, engineering consultancy, construction technology innovation, as well as project management and financing. He noted the keen interest of Hong Kong professionals in participating in large-scale urban development projects abroad. He invited the New Murabba Development Company to conduct a roadshow in Hong Kong to identify suitable partners and explore financing opportunities, thereby fostering collaboration in city development and infrastructure between the two sides.

Mr Chan also attended two networking events yesterday: a high-level luncheon hosted by local bank SAB, and the ""Hong Kong – Saudi Business Dinner"" co-organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Dubai and Invest Hong Kong. At both events, Mr Chan delivered keynote speeches, in which he outlined Hong Kong's latest developments and competitive advantages, and engaged in exchanges with attendees.

Mr Chan emphasised that with the unique advantages of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong serves as a two-way platform connecting the Chinese Mainland with the rest of the world. It is well positioned to facilitate trade, investment, finance and cultural exchanges between China and the Middle East, as well as the wider region. He added that Hong Kong's strengths in finance, commerce, logistics, and innovation and technology, together with its integration with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, offer significant potential for broader collaboration with Saudi Arabia. He welcomed members of the Saudi business community to visit Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to explore co-operation opportunities and expand their business.

Mr Chan concluded his visit to Saudi Arabia last night (October 30, Riyadh time) and will return to Hong Kong at around noon time today (October 31, Hong Kong time)."
