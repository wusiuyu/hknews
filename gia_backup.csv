InvestHK achieves outstanding results in 2025 reflecting strong global investor confidence in Hong Kong (with photo),2026-01-26 09:28,2026-01-26 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012300282.htm," Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) announced today (January 26) that it achieved outstanding results in 2025, assisting a total of 560 overseas and Mainland companies to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong.This represents a 4 per cent increase compared to 2024, reaching a record high and reflecting the strong appeal of Hong Kong's business environmentand foreign investors' confidence and recognition in investing in Hong Kong. 

The strong foreign direct investment (FDI) performance was driven by investment across diverse and high-value industries. It is estimated that the total investment thereby brought to Hong Kong's economy has reached nearly $69.4 billion, a nearly 2 per cent increase compared to 2024; these companies are expected to create 10 748 job opportunities, covering transport, logistics and industrials, tourism and hospitality, as well as the financial services and fintech industries, with around 20 per cent in management/professional level jobs, in Hong Kong during their first year of operation, achieving more than 57 per cent of increment compared to 2024.

The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said, ""I am happy to see the outstanding results achieved by InvestHK last year. Together with record numbers of Mainland and overseas companies and start-ups in the city, there are a clear reflection of the strong global investor confidence in Hong Kong. Our city's unique advantages, such as enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle, proactively integrating into the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), and capitalising on national strategies such as the high-quality co-operation under the Belt and Road Initiative, continue to make it an important hub for businesses and investments, attracting enterprises across the globe to select the city as their base to expand regional businesses in Asia. This year marks the commencement of the 15th Five-Year Plan; the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to create an even more conducive business environment, further promote Hong Kong's national opportunities and international advantages to attract FDI and companies to Hong Kong, demonstrating the city's roles as a 'super-connector' and a 'super value-adder'.""

The Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, said, ""2025 marked a significant chapter in InvestHK's story, celebrating a quarter-century legacy and the new horizons ahead. We will continue to deepen integration into overall national development in the 15th Five-Year Plan, strengthen co-ordination with other GBA cities, and expand engagement with our Mainland counterparts and stakeholders. We will make good use of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global to further support Mainland enterprises to go global via Hong Kong, strengthening the city's role as a powerful conduit for two-way investment. At the same time, the Northern Metropolis is also a strategic priority that the department is actively taking forward. Through preferential policy packages, we are committed to attracting more high-potential companies to set up in Hong Kong and showcasing to the international business community the enormous potential of Hong Kong as a cross-border collaboration platform.""

Record high numbers of companies and start-ups affirm Hong Kong's incomparable business advantages,2026-01-26 09:26,2026-01-26 09:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600135.htm," According to the results of the 2025 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong and the 2025 Startup Survey announced by the Government today (January 26), the number of companies in Hong Kong with Chinese Mainland or overseas parent companies rose to 11 070 in 2025, while the number of start-ups in Hong Kong increased to 5 221, both reaching record highs again. The results demonstrate that Hong Kong's unique attractiveness to enterprises from around the globe continues to rise, and that the city is the ideal investment destination to set up or expand businesses.

 The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, said, ""Even though geopolitics and the global economic and trade landscape are evolving, Hong Kong has been proactively demonstrating its incomparably unique advantages under the 'one country, two systems' principle, as the best two-way springboard for overseas enterprises to tap into the vast Chinese Mainland market and for Chinese Mainland enterprises to go global. Together with the wide array of the latest initiatives to promote economic development, including the establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global, the formulation of preferential policy packages to attract high value-added industries to Hong Kong, the accelerated development of the Northern Metropolis, the establishment of the Economic and Trade Office in Kuala Lumpur, etc, Hong Kong's advantages will continue to strengthen, thereby accelerating the injection of new impetus to our economy and providing more opportunities for both Chinese Mainland and overseas companies based in Hong Kong.

 ""On another note, the number of start-ups in Hong Kong continues to grow at a double-digit percentage rate, signifying that the city is an ideal place for start-ups to thrive, and demonstrating the great confidence that global start-up entrepreneurs have in Hong Kong. Start-ups can leverage the strengths of Hong Kong - including its concentration of internationally renowned universities and research institutes, entrepreneurial talent, and investors from around the world, as well as a strong local network of incubators and accelerators, to rapidly develop innovation and technology businesses that showcase their strengths,"" Mr Yau added.

 The results of the above two local surveys fully display the confidence of Chinese Mainland and overseas companies in Hong Kong's future development. Also, Hong Kong recently received exceptional rankings in reports by various international institutes. For example, Hong Kong was again ranked by the Fraser Institute as the world's freest economy, and moved up to third place overall in foreign direct investment inflows in the World Investment Report 2025 released by the United Nations Trade and Development. Such recognition demonstrates the world's growing awareness of Hong Kong as an international hub for business and investment.

 According to the 2025 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located outside Hong Kong jointly conducted by Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) and the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), there were 11 070 companies in Hong Kong with parent companies located outside Hong Kong in 2025, representing an increase of 11 per cent, which amounted to 1 110 companies, when compared with 2024. The number of people employed reached 509 000, recording an increase of 3 per cent year on year.

 Analysed by the location of parent company, in 2025, the Chinese Mainland was ranked first (3 090), followed by the United States and Japan (both 1 550), the United Kingdom (770) and Singapore (590).

 Analysed by major line of business in Hong Kong, among those 11 070 companies, in 2025, the import/export trade, wholesale and retail sector topped the list (5 100), followed by the financing and banking sector (2 390), and the professional, business and education services sector (1 770).

 In addition, based on the results of InvestHK's 2025 Startup Survey, start-ups in Hong Kong continued to flourish with a record high number of 5 221, up 11 per cent year on year. These start-ups engaged 19 753 persons, representing an increase of 12 per cent year on year, spanned across different sectors, including financial technology; information, computer and technology; biotechnology; education and learning; and health and medical, etc.

 The results of the two surveys have been uploaded onto the websites of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110004&scode=360) and InvestHK (www.investhk.gov.hk/en/resource-centre/?type=brochures-and-guides-general) respectively."
駐港公司和初創企業數目再創新高反映香港無可比擬優勢,2026-01-26 09:26,2026-01-26 09:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/26/P2026012600137.htm,"政府今日（一月二十六日）公布的「二零二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司按年統計調查」和「二零二五年初創企業統計調查」結果顯示，在二○二五年，母公司在內地及海外的駐港公司數目增加至11 070間，而香港的初創企業數目則增至5 221間。兩項數字均再創新高，顯示香港對全球企業的獨特吸引力持續增加，是它們設立或擴展業務的理想投資目的地。

商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺表示：「即使面對地緣政治和環球經貿格局的轉變，香港一直積極發揮在『一國兩制』下無可比擬的獨特優勢，是海外企業開拓內地龐大市場和內地企業出海的最佳雙向跳板。加上政府推出一系列促進經濟的政策措施，包括成立內地企業出海專班、制定優惠政策包吸引高增值產業落戶、加速發展北部都會區、開設駐吉隆坡經濟貿易辦事處等，將繼續增強香港的優勢，加速為經濟注入新動力，為駐港海內外企業帶來更多機遇。」

他續說：「另一方面，香港的初創企業數目持續錄得雙位數字的百分比增長，足證香港是初創企業落戶的理想地點和環球初創企業家對香港的強大信心。初創企業可善用香港的優勢，包括匯聚國際一流的大學及科研機構、具創業精神的人才、來自全球的投資者、以及本地強大的孵化器及加速器網絡等，快速發展創科業務，一展所長。」

上述的本地調查結果充分證明海內外企業對香港前景充滿信心，而香港近期亦在多份國際機構報告中名列前茅，包括再次獲菲沙研究所評定為全球最自由經濟體，以及在聯合國貿易和發展發布的《2025年世界投資報告》中，於外來直接投資流入方面總體排名上升至第三位，印證香港作為世界公認的國際商業和投資樞紐。

根據投資推廣署及政府統計處共同進行的「二零二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司按年統計調查」，二○二五年有香港境外母公司的駐港公司數目達11 070間，較二○二四年增加1 110間，上升11%；而僱用人數高達509 000人，按年上升3%。

按母公司所在地分析，在二○二五年，內地駐港公司數目最多（3 090間），其次是美國和日本（均為1 550間）、英國（770間）及新加坡（590間）。

該11 070間駐港公司中，按在香港的主要業務範圍分析，在二○二五年從事進出口貿易、批發及零售業的駐港公司數目最多（5 100間），其次是金融及銀行業（2 390間），以及專業、商用及教育服務業（1 770間）。

此外，投資推廣署進行的「二零二五年初創企業統計調查」結果顯示，香港的初創企業持續蓬勃發展，二○二五年的數目按年增加11%至5 221間，再創歷史新高，共僱用19 753人，按年增加12%。這些初創企業涵蓋不同行業，包括金融科技；資訊、電腦及科技；生物科技；教育及學習；以及健康及醫療等。

兩項調查結果已分別上載至政府統計處（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1110004&scode=360）及投資推廣署（www.investhk.gov.hk/zh-hk/resource-centre/?type=投資推廣署小冊子-general）網頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-25 17:30,2026-01-25 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/25/P2026012500485.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 25), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

​
The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD.

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
