During the operation, Hong Kong Customs detected 25 cases and seized about 67 000 suspected counterfeit goods, including watches, handbags, jerseys and footwear, with a total estimated market value of about $44 million.

Through intelligence analysis and in-depth investigations, Hong Kong Customs in the operation detected 19 related cases at a number of local express couriers and logistics companies. Moreover, Customs at the Tuen Mun River Trade Terminal intercepted a 40-foot container that was destined for transshipment from Hong Kong and discovered a batch of suspected counterfeit goods therein.

Meanwhile, Customs officers detected five cases at the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge Hong Kong Port and the Shenzhen Bay Control Point, seizing batches of suspected counterfeit goods from five incoming lorries. Five male lorry drivers, aged between 53 and 69, were arrested. The five arrestees have been released on bail pending further investigation.

Hong Kong Customs will continue to work closely with the Mainland Customs, Macao Customs and overseas law enforcement agencies to vigorously combat cross-boundary counterfeit goods transshipping activities through intelligence exchanges and joint enforcement actions.

Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who imports or exports any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.

梁主席（全國政協副主席梁振英）、李會長（香港Web3.0標準化協會執行會長李鳴）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。今天，我非常榮幸受邀參加「錨」定Web3.0未來高峰會暨RWA研究與技術成果發表會，並為大會致辭。我衷心感謝Web3.0標準化協會組織這次盛會，並向蒞臨現場的各位嘉賓表示熱烈的歡迎。

探索代幣化機遇，推動數字經濟

本次高峰會以區塊鏈等前沿科技賦能數字經濟為主題，聚焦如何通過標準化支持香港數字資產與穩定幣的創新發展，加速Web3.0產業的健康成長。代幣化作為全球金融科技的熱點，正深刻改變金融市場的運作方式。根據市場的研究報告指出，全球代幣化基金的資產管理規模已超過20億美元，預計到二○三○年將可能達到6,000億美元，約佔全球共同基金及ETF（交易所買賣基金）市場的百分之一。這一趨勢為香港帶來了前所未有的機遇，同時也伴隨着挑戰。

政府致力將香港打造成全球領先的數字資產中心，構建一個風險可控、創新蓬勃的市場環境，為實體經濟和金融市場創造實質效益。今天，我邀請各位與我一同探索如何平衡機遇與挑戰，推動香港成為Web3.0時代的領航者。

香港代幣化的領先實踐

香港在代幣化領域已取得顯著成績，奠定了全球領先地位。早於二○二三年二月，政府發行了全球首筆八億港元的代幣化綠色債券，採用區塊鏈實現交付對支付結算，標誌着香港在綠色金融與代幣化的領導地位。今年二月，有金融機構推出了亞太地區首個零售代幣化貨幣市場基金，投資於港幣計價的短期存款和高質量貨幣市場工具，降低投資門檻，便利投資者參與，推動資產管理的數字化轉型。今年五月亦有銀行推出香港首個銀行主導的區塊鏈結算服務，支持企業客戶的港幣及美元即時支付和代幣化存款於貿易融資的應用，顯著提升跨境交易效率。這些案例展示了香港在代幣化領域的創新能力，為全球金融市場提供了可複製的範例。

《政策宣言2.0》：數字經濟的未來藍圖

為抓住數字資產及代幣化機遇，政府推出了《政策宣言2.0》（《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》），秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，勾畫前瞻性的策略，促進普惠金融、培養人才、保障投資者，並鞏固香港作為國際金融中心的地位。

優化法律與監管框架

政府持續與監管機構及業界持份者合作，制定全面的法律與監管框架以規管數字資產，確保香港數字資產生態圈能夠可持續且負責任地發展。該框架以保護投資者及消費者為核心，並涵蓋數字資產交易所、穩定幣發行人、數字資產交易服務提供者及數字資產託管服務提供者。由今年八月一日開始，穩定幣法案已經生效，為穩定幣發行人提供清晰監管框架，促進其在實體經濟上的應用。而數字資產交易服務提供者及數字資產託管服務提供者的公眾諮詢則正在進行，到這個月底便會結束。我在此賣個廣告，希望大家能踴躍發表意見。

擴展代幣化產品種類

除了我剛才提到關於法規的工作，《政策宣言2.0》有另一個角度，就是擴展代幣化產品的種類。政府還將定期發行代幣化政府債券，明確代幣化ETF的印花稅寬免，提升市場流動性，並研究貴金屬、有色金屬及可再生能源等多元化資產的代幣化應用，展示技術的廣泛應用潛力。

推進應用場景及跨界別合作

第三個方面是應用場景。為表達支持及起帶頭作用，政府歡迎市場參與者就政府可如何試驗及使用獲發牌的穩定幣提出建議。另外，數碼港亦已推出區塊鏈及數字資產試點資助計劃，為具有未來應用潛力、標誌性和具市場影響力的申請項目提供資金。

人才與合作夥伴發展

最後是人才的培育。政府與業界及學術界合作，通過聯合研究項目，培育新一代企業家、研究人員及技術專家，將香港定位為數字資產知識分享及國際合作的中心。

結語

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，香港的獨特優勢令我們在推動傳統金融步入數字資產時代方面盡佔先機。《政策宣言2.0》訂定的框架有助我們邁向我剛才說的四個方面，就是「LEAP」，形成一個值得信賴、可持續且深度融入實體經濟的數字資產生態圈。同時也讓香港站穩在數字轉型的前沿，為企業和投資者提供清晰路線圖，讓大家在穩健和發展蓬勃的數字資產市場運籌帷幄。我也祝願今天的大會圓滿成功。謝謝大家。"

In terms of innovation resources, Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone is home to Mainland China's only and the world's fourth spallation neutron source. It has also attracted numerous research institutions, including the City University of Hong Kong (Dongguan) and the Greater Bay Area University (Songshan Lake Campus), positioning itself at the forefront of national scientific research.

 To implement the co-operation between Hong Kong and Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone, InvestHK signed an MOU today by the Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, and Vice Mayor of the Dongguan Municipal People's Government and Secretary of the Party Working Committee of Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone, Mr Chen Qingsong, at InvestHK's head office. Representatives from both sides also had in-depth exchanges to further promote the deep integration of scientific research and industry between Dongguan and Hong Kong. Leveraging Hong Kong's advantages in international research network and intellectual property protection, combined with Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone's advanced manufacturing capabilities and comprehensive industrial infrastructure, both parties aim to jointly build a thriving innovation and technology ecosystem. As an international financial and trade centre, Hong Kong serves as both a gateway for bringing in global innovation, technology and capital to Dongguan and a springboard for supporting Dongguan enterprises in expanding into overseas markets.

 Prior to the signing ceremony, Ms Lau attended the listing ceremony of a renowned pharmaceutical company, Sunshine Lake Pharma, from Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This event highlighted the pathway for Mainland enterprises to access international markets through Hong Kong's capital markets. Since its establishment in 2000, InvestHK has assisted over 7 700 enterprises from the Mainland and around the world in setting up or expanding in Hong Kong, with more than 145 successfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

 Ms Lau said, ""As one of the national-level high-tech industrial development zones, Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone has not only developed numerous cutting-edge technologies and nurtured countless innovative talent but also serves as a crucial platform for promoting the transformation of scientific achievements and industrial upgrading. We believe that this co-operation can create a synergy effect from Hong Kong's international advantages and the innovative edge of Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone, helping enterprises and talent from the zone to shine on the global stage.""

 Mr Chen said, ""Dongguan and Hong Kong have a long history of co-operation. Today, under the guidance of the national development strategy for the GBA, the two cities are accelerating their collaborative development. This MOU signing will further stimulate the synergy effects of resource sharing and complementary advantages, deepen market connectivity, help more high-quality enterprises expand overseas, and jointly explore new opportunities for innovative co-operation.""

 According to the MOU, InvestHK will provide one-stop support for enterprises from Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone to leverage Hong Kong as a gateway to global markets. This includes facilitating access to international capital markets, matching them with world-class professional service partners, and offering support in areas such as office site selection, R&D implementation and talent acquisition. By integrating resources from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, InvestHK aims to provide comprehensive assistance to help enterprises expand financing channels and enhance the global influence of their brands and technologies. At the same time, both parties will establish a collaboration mechanism to pool policies, funding, and professional resources, promoting the industrialisation and commercialisation of innovative achievements and jointly creating an internationally competitive ecosystem for innovative enterprises.

 Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone also opened a Songshan Lake Science City Hong Kong Operations Centre yesterday (August 6) at the InnoCentre in Hong Kong. This initiative aims to foster collaboration and exchange between Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone and Hong Kong in the technology industry, actively supporting the major strategic deployment of the GBA. InvestHK's leadership team also attended the unveiling ceremony to explore new opportunities for deepening collaboration and exchange.

 Looking ahead, InvestHK will continue to work with Songshan Lake High-Tech Zone to deepen co-operation in areas such as innovation and entrepreneurship, talent exchange, and overseas expansion. Through collaborative efforts, the two parties aim to strengthen connection within the GBA, jointly creating a platform for enterprises to go global.

CAD engages in air traffic management technology trials with regional partners (with photo),2025-08-07 15:00,2025-08-07 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700266.htm,"âThe Director-General of Civil Aviation, Mr Victor Liu, visited the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) Innovation Lab and was updated on Flight and Flow Information for a Collaborative Environment (FF-ICE), Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO), as well as the latest developments of regional air traffic management projects today (August 7). He also took this opportunity to commend the CAD team on their successful participation in the inaugural Asia-Pacific Regional Laboratory Demonstration of TBO held in Hanoi, Vietnam, from July 22 to 24.

TBO is an advanced air traffic management (ATM) approach being promoted globally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in line with the Global Air Navigation Plan to optimise flight operations and enhance trajectory management. Through System Wide Information Management, FF-ICE forms the foundation for TBO, enabling richer and more collaborative information such as flight trajectories, weather, airport operations and air traffic flow management information to be shared among airspace users and air navigation service providers (ANSPs) under the platform. This collaborative approach can help to optimise flight paths, thus effectively reducing flight time, fuel consumption and carbon emissions, making ATM and flight operations more efficient and environmentally friendly.

Since 2023, the CAD has been working closely with other ANSPs in the Asia-Pacific region on trial information exchanges for TBO. During the laboratory demonstration held in Hanoi, the CAD successfully showcased its FF-ICE prototype system developed in-house to the regional ANSPs, demonstrating the CAD's technological innovation and pioneer position in the field of future ATM development.

Mr Liu commended the team's dedication and encouraged them to continue to embrace and effectively apply new technologies and actively participate in regional collaboration. The CAD will continue to work closely with the ICAO and other ANSPs to further enhance ATM efficiency to accommodate future air traffic demand and growth in the Asia-Pacific region."

Housing Department responds to Ombudsman's direct investigation report,2025-08-07 12:00,2025-08-07 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700219.htm,"  Regarding a report released by the Office of the Ombudsman today (August 7) on its direct investigation into ""Housing Department's Management of Public Housing Estates: Air-conditioner Dripping"", the Housing Department (HD) expressed appreciation to the Ombudsman for recognising the pro-active attitude and initiative of the Housing Authority/HD in implementing enhancement measures in managing water dripping from air-conditioners in public housing estates to continuously improve the effectiveness of estate management.

  The HD has implemented multiple measures to address the issue of water dripping from air-conditioners in public housing estates. These include the launching of the Installation Programme of Condensation Drain-pipe for Air-conditioners in 2006 to put in place condensation drain pipes in public rental housing (PRH) flats to facilitate the discharge of condensation water from air-conditioners. Since 2008, water dripping from air-conditioners has been included in the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement in Public Housing Estates (Marking Scheme), with follow-up actions handled through daily patrols and inspections by special operation teams. In addition, the HD adopts information technology, including the trial use of the ""Mobile Application System for Daily Patrol"" which enables frontline security personnel and building supervisors to report cases of water dripping from air-conditioners in real time for swift follow-up actions. The HD is also actively exploring the use of professional technological equipment to assist in identifying the source of water dripping.

  The number of complaints regarding water dripping from air-conditioners received by the HD has significantly decreased by 93 per cent, from approximately 18 900 cases in 2005 to an average of about 1 300 cases per year from 2022 to 2024, accounting for 0.16 per cent of about 800 000 PRH households and clearly reflecting that the effectiveness of the multiple measures implemented by the HD in the handling of cases for water dripping from air-conditioners.

  The HD has further implemented enhanced measures in December 2024 by giving five days for concerned households to rectify any water dripping problem from their air-conditioners, failing which, action would be taken immediately under the Marking Scheme. Meanwhile, enforcement efficiency has been improved by allowing security supervisors in all public housing estates to issue ""Notification Slips"" to offending households on the spot. The HD will continue to strengthen staff training and supervision of outsourced property management companies.

  Furthermore, the HD will continue to strengthen publicity and education for PRH households through various channels, reminding residents to regularly maintain and repair air-conditioners. Since households sometimes may not be aware of water dripping from their air-conditioners, the HD encourages affected individuals to provide information and work together to identify the source of water dripping.

  ""We would like to thank the Ombudsman for the affirmation and recognition of our efforts, and appreciate its valuable views on the current mechanisms and measures. We accept the relevant recommendations and will continue to streamline our workflow, thereby ensuring such cases can be detected and addressed promptly,"" an HD spokesman said."
​房屋署回應申訴專員公署主動調查報告,2025-08-07 12:00,2025-08-07 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080700216.htm,"就申訴專員公署今日（八月七日）發表「房屋署對公共屋邨的管理：冷氣機滴水」的主動調查報告，房屋署感謝公署肯定香港房屋委員會／房屋署在執管公共屋邨的冷氣機滴水問題的積極性，並主動採取優化措施，持續提升公共屋邨管理效能。

房屋署已實施多項措施針對公共屋邨冷氣機滴水事宜，包括早於二○○六年推行冷氣機去水管安裝計劃，為公屋單位裝置冷氣機去水管，方便租戶將冷氣機冷凝水排走；自二○○八年起將冷氣機滴水納入屋邨管理扣分制（扣分制）的規管，並透過日常巡查及特遣隊巡查跟進租戶冷氣機滴水的情況。此外，房屋署運用資訊科技，包括於屋邨推出「巡邏易」試驗計劃，讓前線護衞職員及樓宇監督透過專用手機程式實時報告冷氣機滴水的情況，以便迅速跟進；亦積極探討使用專業科技器材，協助查找滴水源頭。

房屋署接獲冷氣機滴水的投訴宗數已大幅下降百分之九十三，由二○○五年約18 900宗下降至二○二二至二○二四年每年平均約1 300宗，佔約80萬公屋租戶的0.16%，反映房屋署已實施的多項措施有效處理冷氣機滴水個案。

房屋署在二○二四年十二月起更進一步實施優化措施，給予租戶五天限期處理冷氣機出現滴水情況，否則會即時採取扣分制措施；並同時提升執管效能，所有公共屋邨的保安監督人員可即場向違規租戶發出「違例事項通知書」。房屋署會繼續加強職員培訓，以及對外判物業管理公司的監管。

此外，房屋署會繼續透過不同渠道加強公屋住戶的宣傳教育，提醒租戶定期保養和維修冷氣機。由於租戶有時候並不容易察覺自己單位的冷氣機滴水，房屋署鼓勵受影響的人士提供資料，攜手合作找出滴水源頭。

房屋署發言人說：「我們感謝公署對我們工作的肯定和認同，亦感謝公署對現行機制和措施提供寶貴意見。我們接納有關建議，並會繼續優化工作流程，從而及早發現並處理這些個案。」"
Office of The Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into Housing Department's handling of air-conditioner dripping in public housing estates (with photo),2025-08-07 11:00,2025-08-07 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080600680.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (August 7) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the Housing Department (HD)'s handling of air-conditioner dripping in public housing estates, with 15 major recommendations for improvement made to the HD.

Over 780 000 households, comprising about 2 million residents, live in 195 public housing estates under the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA). The HD and its property services agents (PSAs) are responsible for the daily management of these estates, which encompasses a wide array of duties. Proper management of public housing is a crucial livelihood issue. Following the Office of The Ombudsman's direct investigation operation into illegal parking in public housing estates completed in March this year, this direct investigation operation deals with air-conditioner dripping.

Mr Chan said, ""Over the years, the HD has made extensive efforts to successfully alleviate the problem of air-conditioner dripping through the implementation of the air-conditioner drain-pipe installation programme, and inclusion of such misdeeds under the Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement. The number of complaints received by the HD dropped by 93 per cent from around 18 900 in 2005 to an average of around 1 300 from 2022 to 2024. This remarkable accomplishment merits recognition and appreciation.""

However, air-conditioner dripping remains a typical problem every summer. The HD must step up its efforts to ensure a hygienic and quality living environment for residents. Among the public housing estates under HKHA, the property management of around two-thirds are outsourced to the HD's PSAs (known as outsourced estates), and the remaining one-third are directly managed by the HD (known as directly managed estates).

Between 2022 and 2024, outsourced and directly managed estates received 2 826 and 1 049 complaints respectively about air-conditioner dripping. During those years, related complaints rose by 45.5 per cent in outsourced estates and 20.1 per cent in directly managed estates. In 2024, 10.6 per cent of the complaints in outsourced estates were repeated complaints, compared to 6.3 per cent in directly managed estates. These figures reflect that directly managed estates outperformed outsourced estates, where outsourced estates had a higher increase in the number of complaints and a higher percentage of repeated complaints. In terms of the proportion of complaints over the number of households, outsourced estates recorded percentages of 0.17 per cent, 0.20 per cent and 0.24 per cent in 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively while directly managed estates recorded percentages of 0.12 per cent, 0.12 per cent and 0.14 per cent during the same period.
There are two categories of misdeeds under the Marking Scheme: those incurring a warning prior to the allotment of penalty points, and those resulting in an immediate point allotment. Air-conditioner dripping falls into the former category. The Office's investigation revealed that in air-conditioner dripping cases, the HD's PSAs often issued reminder letters to non-compliant tenants before enforcing the Marketing Scheme. These letters were merely advisory in nature. During the Office's inquiry and investigation, initially the HD had not yet formulated guidelines on issuing reminder letters. Between 2022 and 2024, the HD's PSAs issued an average of two reminder letters per complaint, which was more than tenfold of those issued in directly managed estates. There were cases which revealed that despite the repeated issuance of reminder letters, the dripping problem still occurred. As the HD's PSAs might not be required to report the number of reminder letters issued to the HD, the HD can hardly verify whether its PSAs are issuing too many reminder letters or mishandling air-conditioner dripping complaints.

The Office's investigation also found that the HD's operational guidelines for handling air-conditioner dripping cases are too brief, focusing only on the procedures for enforcing the Marking Scheme without clear instructions for frontline staff on such aspects as complaint investigations, source detections, air-conditioner testing and its duration, dealing with unco-operative tenants and arranging follow-up inspections. The Office considers the absence of proper guidelines might have resulted in inconsistent handling by frontline staff, as evidenced in some cases.

The Office is pleased to note that during its inquiry and investigation, the HD has, since December 2024, implemented enhanced measures under the Marking Scheme, such as launching standardised ""advisory letters"", granting a uniform grace period of five days and formulating guidelines for issuing advisory letters and follow-up actions etc.

Mr Chan said, ""Nothing about people's livelihoods is trivial. Air-conditioner dripping probably causes not only hygiene-related nuisances but also noise disturbances. From an estate management perspective, it is incumbent on the HD to thoroughly enforce the Marking Scheme in order to address the dripping problems and resolve such complaints promptly. The Office considers it undesirable for the HD to be unable to ascertain in the past whether its PSAs were issuing too many reminder letters and handling cases inconsistently. The Office recommends that the HD explore ways to formulate measures for monitoring the issuance of advisory letters and case reporting to strengthen its supervision of its PSAs, as well as to record the details and follow-up actions in relation to air-conditioner dripping complaints more systematically. The HD should also beef up its operational guidelines and expedite the adoption of innovative technologies to improve its ability to trace the sources of dripping. Furthermore, the Office recommends that the HD consider collaboration with other government departments (such as the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD)) to foster exchanges of experiences across their respective areas of responsibility.""

Overall, the Office has made 15 major recommendations for improvements. It is pleased to note that all the recommendations have been agreed by the HD.
The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the HD include:

• explore the formulation of measures for monitoring the issuance of advisory letters and case reporting to strengthen its supervision of its PSAs;

• explore how to record the details and follow-up of dripping complaints more systematically to facilitate monitoring;

• consider enhancing its operational guidelines for handling air-conditioner dripping cases, enabling estate management staff to work in clarity and effectively;

• beef up the operational guidelines with clear procedures for frontline staff to investigate the source of dripping, including making every effort to enter suspected flats for air-conditioner testing where there is no other way to verify the source of dripping, for example, when the source cannot be determined through external observation, standardising the durations for testing, and specifying follow-up actions when the source remains unidentified;

• draw up operational guidelines and notices in designated format for cases where the source of dripping has not been determined;

• consider requiring its PSAs to include in their monthly reports the number of advisory letters issued and any repeated cases to facilitate problem detection and follow-up;

• expedite and broaden the adoption of innovative technologies to strengthen its ability to detect dripping air-conditioners; and

• consider collaborating with other government departments (such as the FEHD) to explore opportunities of conducting large-scale inspections as well as publicity and education campaigns, with a view to increasing public engagement and boosting awareness of proper air-conditioner maintenance.

​申訴專員公署公布就房屋署處理公共屋邨冷氣機滴水的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2025-08-07 11:00,2025-08-07 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/07/P2025080600678.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（八月七日）宣布公署完成房屋署處理公共屋邨冷氣機滴水的主動調查行動，並向房屋署提出共15項主要改善建議。

超過78萬住戶、約200萬居民居住於香港房屋委員會（房委會）轄下的195條公共屋邨。屋邨的日常管理由房屋署或其聘任的外判服務承辦商負責，管理範疇眾多，公屋管理是否妥善，屬重要民生事宜。繼公署今年三月完成有關公共屋邨違例泊車的主動調查行動後，是項主動調查行動處理的是冷氣機滴水。

陳積志表示：「房屋署多年來做了大量相關工作，透過推行冷氣機去水管安裝計劃以及將冷氣機滴水不當行為納入屋邨管理扣分制，成功將冷氣機滴水的問題大幅改善。房屋署收到的投訴，由二○○五年的約18 900宗下降至近三年（即二○二二至二○二四年）每年平均約1 300宗，下降幅度高達93%，工作成果值得肯定和讚賞。」

然而，冷氣機滴水滋擾始終是每年夏天的常見問題，房屋署有責任更妥善處理，為居民締造衞生和優質的居住環境。現時房委會轄下的公共屋邨之中，約三分之二的物業管理工作由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商承辦（外判邨），其餘三分之一則由房屋署直接管理（直管邨）。

外判邨與直管邨於二○二二至二○二四年期間，分別接獲2 826宗和1 049宗冷氣機滴水投訴。外判邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字從二○二二年至二○二四年上升45.5%，而直管邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字則上升20.1%。於二○二四年，外判邨的重複投訴佔10.6%，而直管邨則為6.3%。這些數字均顯示直管邨情況較佳，而外判邨的投訴升幅或重複投訴百分比，均表現稍遜。若以投訴所佔戶數計算，外判邨的冷氣機滴水投訴個案數字，於二○二二年、二○二三年及二○二四年0.17%、0.20%和0.24%﹔而直管邨於該三年接獲投訴的宗數則佔0.12%、0.12%和0.14%。

扣分制下的不當行為可分為先警告後扣分及即時扣分兩類，冷氣機滴水屬先警告後扣分的違規事項。公署發現，就冷氣機滴水個案，房屋署的外判服務承辦商在執行扣分制之前，不時會向違規租戶發出僅屬勸諭性質的提示信，而公署查訊及調查初期，房屋署沒有為發出提示信制訂指引。在二○二二至二○二四年期間，外判邨的外判服務承辦商就每宗投訴平均發出兩封提示信，數目超過直管邨的十倍。有個案顯示，外判服務承辦商多次發出提示信，未能有效令違規租戶糾正冷氣機滴水的問題。而由於由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商未必須向房屋署呈報提示信數目，該署無法確定外判服務承辦商有否濫發提示信或對冷氣機滴水個案處理不當。

公署調查亦發現，房屋署有關處理冷氣機滴水個案的工作指引比較簡略，只列明執行扣分制的程序，但未有詳述前線人員應如何調查投訴、確定滴水源頭、測試冷氣機及所需時間、處理租戶不合作的情況、安排覆查等。公署認為，正如部分個案顯示，在欠缺適切指引下，前線職員或會處理不一。

公署欣悉，在公署查訊及調查期間，房屋署於二○二四年十二月實施扣分制加強措施，例如統一勸諭信、給予一律五天的寬限期，以及就發出勸諭信及跟進行動訂立指引等。

陳積志表示：「民生無小事，冷氣機滴水可能造成環境衞生滋擾，亦有可能產生噪音滋擾。從屋邨管理角度而言，房屋署有責任貫徹執行扣分制，遏止冷氣機滴水問題及如有相關投訴應盡快解決。公署認為，房屋署無法確定其外判服務承辦商有否濫發提示信及處理不一的情況並不理想。公署建議，房屋署應研究制訂有關發出勸諭信和報告個案的監管措施，加強對其外判服務承辦商的監管，以及研究如何更有系統記錄冷氣機滴水投訴個案的詳情及跟進行動。房屋署亦應加強工作指引，並加快引入創新科技，強化查找冷氣機滴水源頭的能力。此外，公署亦建議房屋署考慮與其他政府部門（例如食物環境衞生署（食環署））協作，就不同範疇互相交流經驗。」

整體而言，公署提出共15項主要改善建議。公署欣悉，房屋署同意公署提出的所有改善建議。

公署向房屋署提出的主要改善建議包括：

• 研究制訂有關發出勸諭信和報告個案的監管措施，加強對由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商的監管；

• 研究如何更有系統記錄冷氣機滴水投訴個案的詳情及跟進行動，以便利監管；

• 考慮優化處理冷氣機滴水個案的工作指引，讓屋邨管理人員可更清晰及有效工作﹔

• 於工作指引明確訂明前線人員應如何調查滴水源頭，包括在沒有其他方式核實的情況下，例如當無法從外觀察確定滴水源頭，盡可能進入懷疑滴水的單位測試冷氣機，並訂定冷氣機測試的時間標準，以及找不到滴水源頭的話，其後續跟進的程序；

• 就處理未能鎖定滴水源頭的情況，訂立工作指引和制訂指定格式的通告文件﹔

• 考慮要求由房屋署聘任的外判服務承辦商在每月報告標示發出勸諭信的數目，以及有否重複個案，以便較易察覺問題及跟進﹔

• 加快及繼續引入創新科技，強化查找冷氣機滴水源頭的能力；及

• 考慮與其他政府部門協作（例如食環署）探討可否配合進行大規模的巡查行動及宣傳教育活動，藉以增加迴響，提升市民妥善維修保養冷氣機的意識。

FEHD collaborates with relevant departments and stakeholders to strengthen post-rain mosquito control and elimination efforts,2025-08-06 21:16,2025-08-06 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600837.htm,"In response to the prolonged rain on recent days, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will continue to collaborate with relevant departments and stakeholders to strengthen mosquito control and elimination efforts. These include removing stagnant water at construction sites and locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, and eliminating adult mosquitoes. The FEHD also urges members of the public and stakeholders, including property management companies and construction sites, to step up inspections and remove stagnant water in their areas to prevent and control mosquito infestation.

âA spokesman for the FEHD said today (August 6) that, repeated heavy rain may wash away pesticides previously applied in the environment and lead to increased water accumulation. Sites where stagnant water and mosquito breeding were once detected may now have shifted. The FEHD is therefore continuing to work with relevant departments and stakeholders to intensify inspections of high-risk locations prone to water accumulation after heavy rains, including construction sites, works sites and spots that have previously recorded high gravidtrap indices. If stagnant water is found to be a potential mosquito breeding ground, it will be removed immediately. Larvicides such as temephos sand granules will be applied to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and ultra-low volume fogging operations will be carried out in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.
â
âThe FEHD has also collaborated with District Councils, District Offices, and relevant stakeholders to strengthen publicity and education efforts, and to conduct joint clean-up operations targeting mosquito breeding blackspots (such as public areas in ""three-nil"" buildings) in the districts to further curb mosquito breeding.

August is Hong Kong's rainy season, and hot, rainy weather fosters rapid mosquito breeding. The FEHD reminds members of the public and stakeholders to continue mosquito prevention efforts and remove stagnant water to reduce mosquito breeding opportunities. Effective mosquito control requires the collaborative efforts of the public and all sectors.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and promptly take special mosquito prevention and control measures at home and in other environments during heavy rain. These measures include:


Check home environment (outdoor and open areas in particular) for stagnant water, which can easily lead to mosquito problems;
Check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks, to prevent stagnant water;
âCover water containers such as buckets and basins; and
Check and clean areas prone to stagnant water at least weekly to prevent mosquito breeding.


âPerson-in-charge of property management companies and schools should take the following measures to prevent mosquito breeding caused by rain:


Inspect common areas of the property/school for large areas of stagnant water, and arrange for the removal of stagnant water and filling of sunken areas;
Check drain gates and outlets for blockage by dead leaves or rubbish, and keep drains clear;
Check umbrella stands, umbrella tubes, and air-conditioner drip trays to prevent stagnant water;
âProperly dispose of water containers and place rubbish in covered bins;
âAfter heavy rain, manhole keyhole fillers, adhesive tape, or plastic keyhole covers may be washed away by rainwater. These should be refilled with sand or covered with plastic keyhole covers or adhesive tape; and
Inspect green areas including flower pots, flower beds or gardening areas, and remove stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding.


âConstruction site managers should also conduct early assessments and implement effective measures to prevent mosquito infestations. These measures include:


Inspect the construction site during and after heavy rain to ensure there is no stagnant water that could breed mosquitoes. If large areas of stagnant water are present, they should be emptied as soon as possible using tools like a pump;
âCheck water barriers or other items (such as canvas for covering) for stagnant water. Bamboo scaffolding should have its end caps sealed with fine sand or drilled through to prevent water accumulation; and
If stagnant water is difficult to remove, apply larvicides such as temephos sand granules as appropriate.


âMembers of the public may refer to the FEHD's webpage on mosquito prevention and control (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html), and should constantly pay attention to the information regarding chikungunya fever released by the Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health. The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems."
CHP investigates three new imported chikungunya fever cases,2025-08-06 20:50,2025-08-06 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600823.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (August 6) announced that three new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded, all of which were imported cases, as at 5pm today. The CHP will continue to strengthen its surveillance work in view of the recent CF cases. The CHP reminded members of the public to maintain strict environmental hygiene, mosquito control and personal protective measures both locally and when travelling outside Hong Kong. Avoiding mosquito bites and eliminating mosquito breeding sites are effective ways to prevent CF.

The first case involves a 79-year-old female with good past health living in Southern District. Initial investigations revealed that the patient travelled to Foshan in Guangdong Province to visit relatives between July 1 and 31, and did not recall any history of mosquito bites during the stay. She developed fever and joint pain since August 4. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Queen Mary Hospital yesterday (August 5) and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. The patient is now in stable condition. Her blood sample tested positive for CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since the patient stayed in Foshan during most of the incubation period, the CHP considered that the patient was infected during travel, and the case was classified as an imported case. She has no travel collaterals nor household contacts. The CHP's epidemiological investigations is ongoing and has reported the case to the health authorities of Guangdong.

The second and third case involve a 55-year-old man with underlying illnesses and his 10-year-old son with good past health. They live in Kwai Tsing District. Initial investigations revealed that both patients travelled to Bangladesh between July 12 and August 3, and arrived Hong Kong on August 3. The boy recalled a history of mosquito bites during the stay while his father did not recall any history of mosquito bites. The 55-year-old man developed fever and joint pain in Bangladesh since July 27. After returning to Hong Kong, he sought medical attention at Tsing Yi Cheung Hong General Out-patient Clinic on August 4 and was referred to Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital. He was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for treatment in a mosquito-free environment on the same day. The boy developed similar symptoms in Bangladesh since August 1. He sought medical attention at the Hong Kong Adventist Hospital - Tsuen Wan on the day returning to Hong Kong and was admitted. He was transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital yesterday for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. Both patients are now in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for CF virus upon laboratory testing.

Since they stayed in Bangladesh during the whole incubation period, the CHP considered that both patients were infected during travel, and the cases were classified as imported cases. The patient's two household contacts, who are also their travel collaterals, are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance. The CHP's epidemiological investigations is ongoing and has reported the cases to the health authority of Bangladesh.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) is conducting vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations and will intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residence of the patient, as well as locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in the scrubby areas within 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspection of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


A total of four CF cases have been recorded in Hong Kong this year, all of which were imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, between one and 11 CF cases were recorded in Hong Kong each year, all of which were imported cases.

The Head of the Communicable Disease Branch of the CHP, Dr Albert Au, reminded members of the public to adopt precautions in the rainy season against mosquito-borne diseases. If members of the public return from areas affected by mosquito-borne diseases, they should apply insect repellent for 14 days upon arrival in Hong Kong. They should closely observe their personal health condition, in particular symptoms such as fever, joint pain and rash. If they feel unwell, they should seek medical advice promptly and provide their travel details to the doctor for clinical diagnosis and arrangement of appropriate testing based on an individual patient's condition. Members of the public are urged not to self-medicate, particularly with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), as these drugs may cause serious side effects, for example increasing the risk of haemorrhage. In general, children should not take medications containing aspirin to relieve fever or other symptoms, as it may lead to a serious and potentially fatal complication called ""Reye's syndrome"".

Despite severe or fatal cases caused by CF is rare and the symptoms are milder than that of Dengue Fever, and most patients recover on their own, as local mosquitoes have not carried the CF virus, the Government strives to prevent CF from becoming endemic in Hong Kong, and has adopted multi-pronged emergency preparedness, including strengthening public education and publicity, stepping up control measures at boundary control points, enhancing local testing capabilities, arranging mosquito-free environment for treatments, conducting epidemiological investigations and risk assessments for confirmed cases, intensifying mosquito prevention and control measures, etc. The Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP is equipped with sufficient testing capabilities. The CHP has, in collaboration with the Hospital Authority, further enhanced the local testing capabilities to ensure that in the event of an outbreak, suspected cases could be tested as soon as possible with an aim of early detection and diagnosis.

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs. Members of the public are also reminded to take heed of the following advice on mosquito control:


Thoroughly check all gully traps, roof gutters, surface channels and drains to prevent blockage;
Scrub and clean drains and surface channels with an alkaline detergent compound at least once a week to remove any deposited mosquito eggs;
Properly dispose of refuse, such as soft drink cans, empty bottles and boxesin covered litter containers;
Completely change the water of flowers and plants at least once a week. The use of saucers should be avoided if possible;
Level irregular ground surfaces before the rainy season;
Install mosquito screens on windows and doors if necessary, or use mosquito screens or nets in indoor areas;
Avoid staying in shrubby areas; and
Take personal protective measures such as wearing light-coloured long-sleeved clothes and trousers, and apply insect repellent containing DEET to clothing or uncovered areas of the body when doing outdoor activities.

反非法勞工行動拘二十四人（附圖）,2025-08-06 19:45,2025-08-06 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600781.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於八月二日至八月五日一連四日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕24名人士，包括18名懷疑非法勞工及六名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的人士。

行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了66個目標地點，包括酒樓、餐廳、零售商店、賓館、商業大廈及住宅單位等。被捕的18名懷疑非法勞工為四男十四女，年齡介乎19至54歲。當中三名為現職外傭、六名為逾期逗留的前外傭、三名為以訪客身份逗留在港人士、五名為持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）人士、以及一名為輸入勞工。大部分被捕的非法勞工當時在酒樓或餐廳從事各種不同工作，如洗碗、烹飪及侍應等。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的六名人士，年齡介乎38至49歲，他們均為涉案公司或餐廳的相關負責人。

入境處發言人說：「外傭只可以為合約上訂明的僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」

入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

根據現行法例，任何人士向入境事務處職員作出虛假申述，即屬違法。違例者會被檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款港幣十五萬元及入獄十四年。串謀詐騙是嚴重罪行，一經定罪，根據《刑事罪行條例》最高可處監禁十四年。

此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
24 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photos),2025-08-06 19:45,2025-08-06 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600780.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"" for four consecutive days from August 2 to 5, targeting foreign domestic helpers (helper) who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 24 persons, including 18 suspected illegal workers and six suspected employers, were arrested.

  During the operation, ImmD investigators raided 66 target locations including restaurants, retail stores, guest houses, and commercial and residential buildings. The 18 suspected illegal workers comprised four men and 14 women, aged 19 to 54. Among them, three persons were current helpers, six persons were overstaying ex-helpers, three persons were permitted to stay in Hong Kong on visitor status, five persons were found to be holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong, and one person was an imported worker. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers at restaurants performing various jobs, including dishwashing, cooking, waiters and waitresses. Meanwhile, six suspected employers, aged 38 to 49, were in charge of the involved companies or restaurants and suspected of employing the suspected illegal workers.

  ""Helpers should only perform domestic duties for the employers specified in the contracts. They should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employers should not require or allow the helpers to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

  The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  Under the laws of Hong Kong, any person who makes false representation to an Immigration officer commits an offence. Offenders are liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, subject to the maximum penalty of a fine of $150,000 and imprisonment for 14 years. The spokesman continued that conspiracy to defraud is a serious offence. Under the Crimes Ordinance, offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years.

  The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."

Ethics College holds second graduation ceremony (with photos),2025-08-06 19:29,2025-08-06 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600576.htm,"The Correctional Services Department (CSD) held the second graduation ceremony of the Ethics College at Pak Sha Wan Correctional Institution today (August 6) to present graduation certificates to persons in custody (PICs) who have completed the Diploma of Applied Education programme.

All of the second batch of 75 PIC students of the Ethics College, including 60 male PICs from Pak Sha Wan Correctional Institution and 15 female PICs from Lo Wu Correctional Institution, have successfully completed the programme.

Addressing the graduation ceremony, Head of Charities of the Hong Kong Jockey Club Ms Winnie Ying extended her heartfelt congratulations to the graduates. She expressed her appreciation to the PIC students for their relentless efforts and for overcoming limitations during their studies, demonstrating their determination and ability in pursuing a better future through actions. She said that the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust donated funds to the CSD in 2023 to establish the Jockey Club Education Fund for Rehabilitation to support the operation of the Ethics College and assist PICs in continuing their education. This initiative represents community support for PICs, with the hope that through education, PICs who aspire to pursue studies can equip themselves and reintegrate into society.

The Vice President (Research and Institutional Advancement) of the Hong Kong Metropolitan University, Professor Ricky Kwok, teachers from the Li Ka Shing School of Professional and Continuing Education of the Hong Kong Metropolitan University, and volunteer mentors shared their thoughts on stage and encouraged PICs to maintain their passion for learning and a positive attitude, so that they can contribute to society with the knowledge and skills they have acquired.

Moreover, a band composed of PICs delivered a music performance at the ceremony to express their gratitude to their families and correctional officers for their support in the course of PICs' rehabilitation.

In the sharing session, a PIC student expressed his thankfulness to his family members for their unwavering love and to correctional officers for their encouragement, which enabled him to regain his resolve and commit to his studies. He also thanked the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust for its support, as well as teachers and volunteers for their guidance, enabling him to successfully complete the course."
衞生防護中心調查三宗新增基孔肯雅熱輸入個案,2025-08-06 19:07,2025-08-06 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600756.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（八月六日）表示，中心截至今日下午五時，錄得三宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案，全部為輸入個案。中心會繼續就近日錄得的基孔肯雅熱個案加強監測。中心提醒市民，不論在本地或外遊，應時刻注意環境衞生，以及採取防蚊和個人保護措施。避免蚊子叮咬和防止蚊蟲滋生是有效預防基孔肯雅熱的方法。

首宗個案涉及一名過往健康良好的79歲女子，居於南區。初步調查顯示，病人曾於七月一日至三十一日到廣東省佛山市探親，但未能記起曾否被蚊叮。她於八月四日開始出現發燒和關節痛，昨日（八月五日）到瑪麗醫院急症室求診，同日入院並在無蚊環境下接受治療，現時情況穩定。她的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於病人潛伏期大部分時間在佛山市逗留，中心認為她是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人沒有其他同行人士或家居接觸者。中心正繼續流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

第二宗及第三宗個案涉及一名有長期病患的55歲男子及其過往健康良好的10歲兒子，他們居於葵青區。初步調查顯示，兩名病人於七月十二日至八月三日到孟加拉國旅遊，八月三日返抵香港。男童報稱旅遊期間曾被蚊叮咬，而其父親未能記起曾否被蚊叮。該名55歲男子於七月二十七日在孟加拉國出現發燒和關節痛，返港後於八月四日到青衣長康普通科門診診所求診，獲轉介到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，同日入院在無蚊環境下接受治療。而男童於八月一日在孟加拉國出現類似病徵，返港後於同日到香港港安醫院—荃灣求診及入院治療，昨日被轉送瑪嘉烈醫院在無蚊環境下接受治療。兩人現時情況穩定。他們的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

由於他們整個潛伏期在孟加拉國逗留，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。病人的另外兩名家居接觸者亦為同行人士，現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。中心正繼續流行病學調查，並已把個案通報孟加拉國衞生當局。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）正進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並會於個案病人的住所及於病發後曾到訪的地點，加強防蚊滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


本港今年累計錄得四宗基孔肯雅熱個案，均屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗個案，全部為輸入個案。

中心傳染病處主任歐家榮醫生提醒市民，在雨季期間應做好防蚊措施，預防蚊傳疾病。市民如從受蚊傳疾病影響地區回港，應在14日內持續使用昆蟲驅避劑，並密切監察自身健康狀況，留意發燒、關節痛或皮疹等症狀。若感到不適，應盡快求醫，並告知醫生外遊細節，以便醫生作出臨床診斷，並按個別病人情況安排適當檢測。市民切勿自行用藥，尤其是阿司匹林或非類固醇消炎藥（如布洛芬），因這些藥物可能引起嚴重副作用，例如增加出血風險。一般而言，兒童不應服用含有阿司匹林的藥物去舒緩發燒和其他症狀，以防引致「雷爾氏綜合症」，一種嚴重及可致命的併發症。

雖然基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，而病徵亦較登革熱輕微，大部分病人可以自行痊癒，但由於本地蚊媒未帶有基孔肯亞熱病毒，政府會全力預防基孔肯亞熱在本地扎根，已積極採取多項應急準備，包括：全面加強宣傳教育工作、加強口岸防控措施、提升本地檢測能力、安排患者在無蚊環境接受治療、就確診個案進行流行病學調查及風險評估、加強病媒調查及滅蚊等。中心的公共衞生化驗服務處具備充足的檢測能力。中心會為公立及私家醫院的基孔肯雅熱懷疑病例進行檢測。中心已聯同醫院管理局進一步提升本地檢測能力，確保本港一旦出現爆發，懷疑個案可盡快進行化驗，以達致早發現、早診斷。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。市民應繼續採取的措施:


徹底檢查集水溝氣隔、屋頂雨水槽、明渠及排水渠，避免淤塞；
每星期至少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，以除去可能積聚的蚊卵；
汽水罐、空樽及空盒等垃圾應妥善棄置在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
栽種花卉的水應每星期最少徹底更換一次，盡量避免使用墊碟；
在雨季前把凹凸不平的地面填平；
如有需要，可於門窗裝上防蚊網，或在室內地方使用隔蚊簾或蚊帳；
避免在叢林逗留；及
戶外活動期間，做好個人保護措施，穿着淺色長袖上衣和長褲，並於外露的皮膚及衣服上塗上含避蚊胺成分的昆蟲驅避劑。


市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、衞生防護中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
食環署聯同各相關部門及持份者加強雨後控蚊滅蚊工作,2025-08-06 19:05,2025-08-06 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/06/P2025080600766.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）因應連日天雨，會繼續聯同各相關部門及持份者加強控蚊滅蚊工作，包括清除地盤及蚊患風險較高地點的積水、殺滅成蚊等，亦呼籲市民及持份者包括物業管理公司及建築地盤等，加強檢查及清除所屬地方的積水以防治蚊患。

食環署發言人今日（八月六日）表示，連場大雨過後在環境中施放的殺蟲劑會被沖走，各處積水亦增多，過往曾發現的積水及蚊子滋生地可能已轉移位置，食環署正繼續聯同各相關部門及持份者加強巡視區內大雨過後容易積水的風險較高地點，包括建築地盤、工地和過往誘蚊器曾錄得較高指數的地點。如發現有積水造成潛在蚊子滋生地會即時清理，並會於未能即時清除的積水處施放蚊沙等殺幼蟲劑，及於成蚊棲息處如茂密的樹木、陰暗隱蔽的地點及荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署亦已聯同各區區議會、分區民政事務處及各有關持份者加強宣傳教育，以及就區內的蚊子滋生衞生黑點（例如三無大廈的公共地方）開展聯合清理行動，以進一步遏止蚊子滋生。

八月正值香港的雨季，炎熱多雨的天氣有利蚊子迅速繁殖。食環署提醒市民及持份者須繼續防蚊工作，清除積水以減低蚊子滋生的機會。要有效防治蚊患，市民及各界的攜手合作不可或缺。

檢查家居用品（尤其存放於戶外露天地方），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
蓋好水桶、水盆等貯水容器；及
最少每星期檢查及清理容易積水的地方，以阻斷蚊子的繁殖。


物業管理公司及學校的負責人應採取下列措施，以防止天雨導致蚊子滋生：


巡視物業／學校的公共地方會否出現大範圍積水，安排清理積水及把凹陷的地面填平；
檢查渠閘及渠口會否被枯葉或垃圾等堵塞，保持溝渠暢通；
檢查雨傘架、雨傘筒和冷氣機托盤，避免出現積水；
妥善棄置儲水容器，將垃圾放在有蓋的垃圾桶內；
大雨過後沙井蓋匙孔的填補物、膠紙或膠匙孔蓋等或會被雨水沖走，須重新以沙填補，或以膠匙孔蓋或膠紙覆蓋好；及
巡視綠化地帶包括花盆、花圃或園藝種植區等，清除積水以免造成蚊子滋生。


建築地盤的負責人亦應及早作出評估，以及切實執行有效措施以預防蚊患，當中包括：


於大雨期間及大雨過後巡視地盤範圍，確保沒有積水滋生蚊蟲。如出現大範圍積水，應盡快以水泵等工具將積水抽走；
檢查水馬或其他物品（例如遮蓋用的帆布）有否積水；竹棚的竹端用幼沙填塞或把竹端鑽穿，以防積水；及
若有積水難以清除，應適當施用蚊沙等殺幼蟲劑。
