謝展寰在典禮致辭時表示，今屆政府通過推動源頭減廢及擴大回收網絡，成功扭轉廢物棄置量多年來長期不斷上升的趨勢。都市固體廢物的棄置量自二○二一年至二○二四年減少了共7.5%。廢物回收率也由二○二○年的28%，上升至二○二三年的33%。

謝展寰祝賀所有獲獎的學校、學生和家庭，感謝他們對香港減廢回收工作的支持。他說：「要源頭減廢，教育下一代至關重要。環保署在二○二四年推出『回收@校園』活動，向全港中小學校提供多元化的教材及推廣配套，協助學校和教師把減廢回收的知識融入日常教學，鼓勵學生善用學校及社區的回收設施，並帶動家人一起實踐資源分類回收。」

「回收@校園」活動項目自推出以來反應熱烈，至今共有約550間中小學參與計劃，涵蓋約35萬名學生。環保署透過「回收@校園」活動和「海洋公園保育聯盟」在今個學年合作舉辦「SGREEN校際回收比賽」，成功鼓勵更多學校參與雙方的活動。比賽設下列七大獎項，表揚於今學年減廢回收表現卓越的參賽學校、學生及家庭，得獎名單參見附件。


至尊回收學校獎
最高回收量學校獎
最積極參與學校獎

今日的頒獎典禮同場設有21個攤位，獲獎學校及其他參與學校透過互動資訊展覽和攤位遊戲，分享減廢回收、低碳生活和生態保育的知識，展示如何在日常生活中實踐綠色生活。

「回收@校園」活動去年三月一日開展，邀請全港中小學校參與。活動設有不同的減廢回收比賽及獎項，鼓勵學生與家人積極參與減廢回收。在二○二四／二五學年，「SGREEN校際回收比賽」和其他「回收＠校園」比賽合共收集約132 000公斤回收物。"
SEE attends SGREEN x We-recycle@School Competitions Award Ceremony (with photos),2025-07-05 17:09,2025-07-05 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070400477.htm,"  The SGREEN x We-recycle@School Competitions Award Ceremony, co-organised by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and Ocean Park Hong Kong (Ocean Park), was held today (July 5) at Ocean Park. The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, officiated at the event, commending schools, students and families for their outstanding performance in waste reduction and recycling during the 2024/25 school year.

  Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Tse highlighted that the current-term Government has successfully reversed the long-term trend of rising waste disposal quantities over the years through promoting waste reduction at source and expanding the recycling network. The disposal quantity of municipal solid waste decreased by a total of 7.5 per cent from 2021 to 2024, while the waste recovery rate increased from 28 per cent in 2020 to 33 per cent in 2023.

  Mr Tse congratulated all the awarded schools, students and families, expressing gratitude for their support of Hong Kong's waste reduction and recycling efforts. He said, ""To achieve waste reduction at source, it is crucial to educate the next generation. In 2024, the EPD launched the We-recycle@School Activity, providing a variety of teaching materials and promotional support to primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong to assist schools and teachers in integrating waste reduction and recycling knowledge into daily teaching, encourage students to make good use of recycling facilities in schools and the community, and inspire their family members to practise resource separation and recycling together.""

  Since its launch, the We-recycle@School Activity has received an overwhelming response. Currently, around 550 primary and secondary schools have participated in the scheme, encompassing about 350000 students. Through the We-recycle@School Activity, the EPD has collaborated with the Ocean Park Conservation Alliance to jointly host the SGREEN Inter-school Recycling Competition this school year, which successfully encouraged more schools to engage in the activities of both sides. The Competition features seven awards to recognise participating schools, students, and families for their outstanding performances in waste reduction and recycling this school year. The list of award winners can be found in the annex. The awards are:


Supreme Recycling Award - School
Top Recycling Quantity Award - School
Best Participating School Award
Best Participating Family Award
Recycling Guru Award
Best Green and Low Carbon Action Award
Best School Recycling Corner Design Award


  The award ceremony today also featured 21 booths where awarded schools and other participating schools shared their knowledge on waste reduction and recycling, low-carbon living and ecological conservation through interactive exhibitions and booth games, demonstrating how to practise green living in daily life.

  The We-recycle@School Activity was launched on March 1 last year, inviting primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong to participate in the activity which includes various waste reduction and recycling competitions with awards to encourage students and their family members to actively participate in waste reduction and recycling. In the 2024/25 school year, the SGREEN Inter-school Recycling Competition and other We-recycle@School competitions together collected about 132 000 kilograms of recyclables in total."

電影報刊辦表揚中小學生藉創作協助推廣健康使用互聯網信息（附圖）,2025-07-05 16:00,2025-07-05 16:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500276.htm,"電影、報刊及物品管理辦事處（電影報刊辦）今日（七月五日）就「健康學生短片大賽2025」、「《淫褻及不雅物品管制條例》口號創作及填色比賽 2024-25」及「健康貼圖設計大賽」舉行頒獎典禮，表揚獲獎學生及隊伍透過創作協助推廣遠離網上淫褻及不雅資訊的信息。

三項比賽合共吸引約兩萬名中、小學生參與，設有60個主要獎項。評審委員會由電影報刊辦代表和業界的專業人士組成。得獎者分別來自25間小學及20間中學（名單詳見附件），其作品將上載至電影報刊辦網頁供公眾瀏覽。

電影、報刊及物品管理助理專員馮品聰在頒獎典禮上表示，網絡世界包羅萬有，近年各種影片串流或分享平台及社交媒體盛行，兒童及青少年使用網絡時有可能接觸到淫褻及不雅資訊和歪曲的價值觀，影響身心健康。若在互聯網上分享不良資訊，甚或製作相關內容上載至互聯網，更有可能觸犯《淫褻及不雅物品管制條例》（第390章）（《條例》）。為保護兒童及青少年免受網上淫褻及不雅資訊影響，電影報刊辦一直採取多管齊下的策略，在做好監管的同時亦致力加強宣傳和公眾教育，提高公眾尤其是兒童及青少年對《條例》的認識，鼓勵他們遠離不良資訊，並建立正確使用互聯網的觀念。

電影報刊辦在過去一年繼續加強宣傳教育工作，除了舉辦上述比賽外，亦在本學年安排近百場教育短劇巡迴表演，吸引近15 000名中小學生觀看；並在藍田、樂富、天水圍及將軍澳舉辦巡迴展覽，更廣泛地宣傳健康使用互聯網的信息，吸引逾12 000名市民參觀。

電影報刊辦會持續推展上述工作，並會繼續透過舉辦「健康資訊學生大使計劃」、「健康學生演說大賽」及「健康學生戲劇大賽」等不同形式的活動，進一步提高公眾對《條例》的認識和推廣健康上網的觀念。

此外，電影報刊辦亦加強跨部門、跨組織協作，為兒童及青少年、家長、教職員及公眾等不同持份者舉辦多元和具針對性的活動，當中包括聯同民政及青年事務局，通過不同渠道和平台，如家庭議會、青年手機應用程式「HKYouth+」及政府青少年網站（Youth.gov.hk），向兒童及青少年推廣《條例》相關的活動與資訊，以及與香港警務處合作在多區舉辦「善用互聯網」講座，以趣味互動形式向少年警訊會員及學生分享使用互聯網的常見陷阱，協助他們建立正確價值觀，同時加深他們對《條例》的認識。

電影報刊辦亦舉辦多項活動，協助教職員加強在校內的相關工作，包括在二○二四年舉辦逾250場學校講座和三場網上簡介會，向約100間中小學的校長或其代表作簡介，以及於今年參與教育局舉辦的教師專業發展課程研討會，向逾200名小學教師介紹《條例》及相關活動和資源。電影報刊辦並不時舉辦為家長而設的講座、工作坊、網上座談會等活動，與家長和學校攜手協助兒童及青少年建立正確的價值觀，並加強他們拒絕接收不良資訊的能力。

電影報刊辦會繼續致力推動多元化的宣傳及公眾教育工作，與不同持份者攜手合作，積極提高公眾對《條例》的認識和推廣遠離網上淫褻及不雅內容的信息。"
OFNAA commends primary and secondary students for assisting in promoting healthy Internet use through creative works (with photos),2025-07-05 16:00,2025-07-05 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500273.htm," The Office for Film, Newspaper and Article Administration (OFNAA) held a prize presentation ceremony today (July 5) for the ""Healthy Student Video Contest 2025"", the ""'Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance' Slogan and Colouring Competition 2024-25"" and the ""Healthy Mobile App Sticker Design Competition"" in commendation of the winning students and teams for assisting in promoting the message of staying away from obscene and indecent articles online through creative works.

 A total of around 20 000 primary and secondary students participated in the three competitions which offered 60 major awards altogether. The adjudication panel comprised OFNAA representatives and industry professionals. Winners from 25 primary schools and 20 secondary schools (the list is set out in Annex) will have their works uploaded to OFNAA's website for public viewing.

 Speaking at the prize presentation ceremony, the Assistant Director of Film, Newspaper and Article Administration, Mr Chris Fung, said that with the prevalence of various video streaming or video sharing platforms and social media in recent years given rise by the fascinating cyber world, children and young people may be exposed to obscene and indecent materials as well as distorted values while using the Internet, affecting their physical and mental wellbeing. Sharing of harmful materials on the Internet, or even producing and uploading such content on the Internet, may be in breach of the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap. 390) (COIAO). To protect children and young people from the influence of obscene and indecent materials online, OFNAA has been adopting a multi-pronged approach by enhancing publicity and public education in tandem with proper regulation, so as to enhance the understanding of the public, especially children and young people, of the COIAO and to encourage them to stay away from harmful materials and to develop the concept of the proper use of the Internet.

 OFNAA has continued to enhance its publicity and education efforts over the past year. In addition to organising the abovementioned competitions, OFNAA arranged nearly 100 roving drama performances for schools in this academic year, attracting nearly 15 000 primary and secondary students. Roving exhibitions were also held in Lam Tin, Lok Fu, Tin Shui Wai and Tseung Kwan O to promote more widely the message of healthy Internet use, attracting over 12 000 visitors. 

 OFNAA will continue to take forward these efforts and organise various activities including the ""Healthy Information Student Ambassadors Scheme"", the ""Healthy Chinese Public Speaking Competition"" and the ""Healthy Student Drama Contest"" to further enhance the public's understanding of the COIAO and promote the concept of healthy Internet use.

 In addition, OFNAA has strengthened inter-departmental and inter-organisational collaboration to organise diverse and targeted activities for different stakeholders, including children and young people, parents, teaching staff members and the public. These included working with the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau to promote activities and information concerning the COIAO to children and young people through various channels and platforms including the Family Council, the ""HKYouth+"" youth mobile application, and the Government Youth Portal (Youth.gov.hk), as well as partnering with the Hong Kong Police Force to organise ""Wise Use of Internet"" talks at various districts to share common online pitfalls with members of the Junior Police Call and students in an interesting and interactive manner, with a view to helping them develop proper values and deepening their understanding of the COIAO. 

 OFNNA also organised various activities to help teaching staff members strengthen their relevant work in schools, including organising more than 250 school talks and three online briefing sessions for about 100 principals of primary and secondary schools or their representatives in 2024, as well as taking part in the seminars of professional development programme for teachers organised by the Education Bureau this year to introduce the COIAO and relevant activities and resources to over 200 primary school teachers. Additionally, OFNAA organises various activities for parents including talks, workshops, and webinars from time to time, working jointly with parents and schools to help children and young people establish proper values and strengthen their ability to reject harmful materials.

 OFNAA will continue to take forward diverse publicity and public education work and work with various stakeholders to enhance public awareness of the COIAO and promote the message of staying away from obscene and indecent content online."
Speech by CE at Hong Kong Association for External Friendship Inauguration Ceremony (English only) (with photos/video),2025-07-05 15:41,2025-07-05 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500546.htm,"ââFollowing is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship Inauguration Ceremony today (July 5):

Ladies and gentlemen, when I was making preparation for this occasion, my colleagues told me that because we are talking about friendship, I should make three speeches, one in Cantonese, one is Putonghua and one in English. Indeed, Hong Kong focuses on efficiency and good use of time. For your benefit, don't worry, I am going to speak in English because this is an occasion for external friendship.

 Honorable Commissioner Cui Jianchun (Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Secretary General Sun Xueqing (Secretary General of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries), Professor Priscilla Leung (Founding President and Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. I am pleased to join you today to celebrate the inauguration of the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship.

 Today, we will witness not only the beginning of an association, but also the initiation of a new force for global dialogue. A new impetus that facilitates people-to-people exchange, and cultivates friendships.

 Because where better to make friends, and keep them, than in Hong Kong?

 Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage.

 We boast a long tradition of the rule of law, and have a common law system similar to many global financial centres. We are home to five of the world's top 100 universities, and the world's four most international universities – they not only help to nurture a workforce that's bilingual and well-versed with both Mainland and international practices, but also attract a world of students, researchers, and teachers to our city.

 Our simple and transparent tax regime, world-class infrastructure, and the free flow of information, capital, goods and people, make it easy to work, study, or simply live here. To add to all that, our superb location means we're just a five-hour flight from half of the world's population.

 China, our country, supports Hong Kong in deepening international engagement, putting a primacy on co-operation, regionally and globally – in business, trade, finance, education, culture and every other area that governments, companies and peoples can come together for mutually rewarding opportunities.

 The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is dedicated to boosting Hong Kong's relations with different economies. And the results have been recognised by international investors and corporations.

 A week ago, an international newspaper published an article that analysed Hong Kong's thriving stock market, which ranks first, globally, in IPO fundraising so far this year.

 It noted that institutional investors are returning, adding: ""Hong Kong continues to hold appeal as a gateway for Chinese capital and a bridge for international investors seeking exposure to Chinese growth"". Noting that this role of Hong Kong ""remains difficult to replicate"", it added that to dismiss our rebound is ""to overlook the changing dynamics under way"". I think it describes it perfectly.

 Yes, in these times of economic uncertainties, Hong Kong remains a financial harbour wide open to the world, and a world of free and unfettered trade. All thanks to the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and Hong Kong's unique role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" in building bridges among different economies.

 I am delighted to note that the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship is committed to becoming a bridging connector in its own vital way.

 The Association is formed under the guidance of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and focuses on cultivating ""four friendships"" – with cities, associations, organisations and individuals. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of soft power and a critical complement to official diplomatic channels.

 Diplomacy, both public and international, helped inspire the success of last December's Global University Presidents and Leaders Summit – a landmark event organised by the Association that brought together university leaders from around the world in Hong Kong.

 Today's ceremony symbolises a deeper commitment to building bridges between Hong Kong and the world. Creating an organisation, and a way forward, based on dialogue, mutual understanding and collaboration.

 In today's complex and rapidly evolving global landscape, where co-operation is no longer a given, we must unite and remain open to dialogue, to maintaining friendly relations with different places that are eager to pursue development, very much like us. That makes the Association, and its mission, more crucial than ever. For that, I am grateful – grateful to its founder, Professor Priscilla Leung, and all those who have contributed to its establishment.

 The HKSAR Government looks forward to working with you, to empowering the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship to become a dynamic force for international goodwill and co-operation.

 Ladies and gentlemen, for those of you who checked the weather, you may notice a tropical storm is on its way to this part of the globe and could bring us some rainy and windy days.

 To those who ask, ""Can bridges survive storms?"" We always point to our harbour. For centuries, typhoons have battered our shores. But Hong Kong, long a free port, has always provided a safe shelter for ships, seafarers and traders. Even in the harshest of storms and headwinds, Hong Kong will remain a safe and stress-tested harbour. We may not be able to change the global current, but united, we can sail together and chart our common course of co-operation and friendship.

 Together, we will realise a global community of shared future, rooted in economic and cultural harmony and people-to-people connectivity. A flourishing and sustainable future for each and everyone of us.

 Thank you very much."

 The Association is formed under the guidance of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and focuses on cultivating ""four friendships"" – with cities, associations, organisations and individuals. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of soft power and a critical complement to official diplomatic channels.

 Diplomacy, both public and international, helped inspire the success of last December's Global University Presidents and Leaders Summit – a landmark event organised by the Association that brought together university leaders from around the world in Hong Kong.

 Today's ceremony symbolises a deeper commitment to building bridges between Hong Kong and the world. Creating an organisation, and a way forward, based on dialogue, mutual understanding and collaboration.

 In today's complex and rapidly evolving global landscape, where co-operation is no longer a given, we must unite and remain open to dialogue, to maintaining friendly relations with different places that are eager to pursue development, very much like us. That makes the Association, and its mission, more crucial than ever. For that, I am grateful – grateful to its founder, Professor Priscilla Leung, and all those who have contributed to its establishment.

 The HKSAR Government looks forward to working with you, to empowering the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship to become a dynamic force for international goodwill and co-operation.

 Ladies and gentlemen, for those of you who checked the weather, you may notice a tropical storm is on its way to this part of the globe and could bring us some rainy and windy days.

 To those who ask, ""Can bridges survive storms?"" We always point to our harbour. For centuries, typhoons have battered our shores. But Hong Kong, long a free port, has always provided a safe shelter for ships, seafarers and traders. Even in the harshest of storms and headwinds, Hong Kong will remain a safe and stress-tested harbour. We may not be able to change the global current, but united, we can sail together and chart our common course of co-operation and friendship.

 Together, we will realise a global community of shared future, rooted in economic and cultural harmony and people-to-people connectivity. A flourishing and sustainable future for each and everyone of us.

 Thank you very much."
Speech by CE at Hong Kong Association for External Friendship Inauguration Ceremony (English only),2025-07-05 15:41,2025-07-05 16:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500546.htm,"ââFollowing is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship Inauguration Ceremony today (July 5):

Ladies and gentlemen, when I was making preparation for this occasion, my colleagues told me that because we are talking about friendship, I should make three speeches, one in Cantonese, one is Putonghua and one in English. Indeed, Hong Kong focuses on efficiency and good use of time. For your benefit, don't worry, I am going to speak in English because this is an occasion for external friendship.

 Honorable Commissioner Cui Jianchun (Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Secretary General Sun Xueqing (Secretary General of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries), Professor Priscilla Leung (Founding President and Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. I am pleased to join you today to celebrate the inauguration of the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship.

 Today, we will witness not only the beginning of an association, but also the initiation of a new force for global dialogue. A new impetus that facilitates people-to-people exchange, and cultivates friendships.

 Because where better to make friends, and keep them, than in Hong Kong?

 Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle, Hong Kong is the only world city that enjoys both the China advantage and the global advantage.

 We boast a long tradition of the rule of law, and have a common law system similar to many global financial centres. We are home to five of the world's top 100 universities, and the world's four most international universities – they not only help to nurture a workforce that's bilingual and well-versed with both Mainland and international practices, but also attract a world of students, researchers, and teachers to our city.

 Our simple and transparent tax regime, world-class infrastructure, and the free flow of information, capital, goods and people, make it easy to work, study, or simply live here. To add to all that, our superb location means we're just a five-hour flight from half of the world's population.

 China, our country, supports Hong Kong in deepening international engagement, putting a primacy on co-operation, regionally and globally – in business, trade, finance, education, culture and every other area that governments, companies and peoples can come together for mutually rewarding opportunities.

 The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is dedicated to boosting Hong Kong's relations with different economies. And the results have been recognised by international investors and corporations.

 A week ago, an international newspaper published an article that analysed Hong Kong's thriving stock market, which ranks first, globally, in IPO fundraising so far this year.

 It noted that institutional investors are returning, adding: ""Hong Kong continues to hold appeal as a gateway for Chinese capital and a bridge for international investors seeking exposure to Chinese growth"". Noting that this role of Hong Kong ""remains difficult to replicate"", it added that to dismiss our rebound is ""to overlook the changing dynamics under way"". I think it describes it perfectly.

 Yes, in these times of economic uncertainties, Hong Kong remains a financial harbour wide open to the world, and a world of free and unfettered trade. All thanks to the ""one country, two systems"" principle, and Hong Kong's unique role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" in building bridges among different economies.

 I am delighted to note that the Hong Kong Association for External Friendship is committed to becoming a bridging connector in its own vital way.

The two-day course, which covers topics relevant to the rule of law and daily life, provides training to about 120 trainees from district youth committees in the 18 districts and a local university about knowledge on the rule of law in a diversified, interactive, and easy-to-understand manner, encouraging them to become ROLE ambassadors and actively promote the rule of law in their daily lives and work.

The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, and the President of the Education University of Hong Kong, Professor John Lee, delivered opening remarks for the event. Mr Lam expressed the hope that this Programme would enhance the trainees' understanding of the legal system and the rule of law in Hong Kong, as well as their capability in promoting the rule of law as youth leaders and educators in the future, consolidating their role as leaders in the rule of law education.

  On the first day of the course, Mr Lam gave a lecture on the topic of ""Rule of law and our legal system"". He elaborated to the trainees on the essence of the rule of law concept, presented an overview on Hong Kong's legal and judicial systems, and explained to them the relationship between the rule of law and the Constitution, the Basic Law, the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance and ""one country, two systems"".

Member of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) and Member of the Legislative Council, Dr Starry Lee, took part in the Programme as a speaker again to explain to the trainees about the Mainland legal system and the functions of the NPC and state institutions.

The trainees of the third phase of the Programme include members of the District Youth Community Building Committees and District Youth Development and Civic Education Committees in the 18 districts, as well as students of the Education University of Hong Kong. The second day event of the TTL Programme and its graduation ceremony will be held on July 12 and certificates will be presented to trainees who have completed the course.

The third phase of the TTL Programme carries on its legacy and forges ahead with an advanced course and a newly added extended course, with a view to further deepening the understanding of the legal system and the implementation of procedures for trainees who have completed the foundation course. The content of the advanced course includes visits to law enforcement agencies and mock court activities, enabling trainees to gain a first-hand experience of the practice of the rule of law. The new extended course provides thematic talks on specific legal topics, such as a thematic talk on the cyber world which was organised earlier, along with practice activities for promoting the rule of law. This aims to strengthen trainees' legal knowledge and encourage them to organise and participate in various community promotion projects on their own, taking on the roles of promoters and leaders of the rule of law education.

S for Housing visits Barcelona (with photos),2025-07-05 15:05,2025-07-05 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070400495.htm," The Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, commenced her visit to Barcelona, Spain, yesterday (July 4, Barcelona time).

 In the morning, Ms Ho met with Deputy Mayor of Barcelona Mr Jordi Valls Riera, who oversees housing policies, economic affairs and tourism matters. They exchanged views on areas such as housing policies and construction technologies. Ms Ho shared Hong Kong's experience in expeditiously building government-led Light Public Housing (LPH) using Modular Integrated Construction (MiC). For instance, the first LPH project at Yau Pok Road, Yuen Long, took only about one year to complete. As for the Choi Hing Road project in Ngau Tau Kok, which is the first 19-storey LPH project with elevators, its first phase was completed in less than one and a half years, breaking the record for rapid construction of high-rise buildings in Hong Kong. She also shared that the Housing Bureau (HB) and the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) have been continuously optimising Hong Kong's housing ladder to encourage more young people and families to move up the housing ladder. She mentioned that the HB will organise an international symposium to be held in Hong Kong in November this year, to showcase to the world the latest developments of construction technologies in Mainland China and Hong Kong. She expressed hope that friends from around the world could attend the symposium.

 Afterwards, Ms Ho visited a social housing project, Modulus Matrix: 85 Social Housing, which used timber frame construction to reduce carbon emissions and a modular design to shorten construction time.

 In the afternoon, Ms Ho toured a social housing project, APROP-Glòries, which was converted from containers to provide temporary accommodation to people in need. Ms Ho said that both the Hong Kong and Barcelona governments are dedicated to increasing their housing supply with swift and pragmatic approaches, and providing accommodation to families with urgent housing needs. She said she hoped that the two places would continue holding close exchanges on relevant initiatives.

 Ms Ho then paid a courtesy call on the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Barcelona, Ms Meng Yuhong, to share with her various housing initiatives being implemented by the HB, which include promoting the development of housing construction technologies by leveraging the strengths of the Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).

 Ms Ho today (July 5, Barcelona time) visited another social housing project, 72 Social Housing Units, to see its architectural design that creates a simple, livable and energy-efficient living environment.

 Concluding the trip, Ms Ho said, ""Hong Kong enjoys the unique advantage of having the strong support of the motherland while maintaining unparalleled connectivity with the world, as well as the strategic geographical location of being connected to the GBA. This visit demonstrated how Hong Kong gives full play to its important roles as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder'. I look forward to maintaining close exchanges with Portugal and Spain in areas including innovative construction technologies, people-oriented 'Well-being design' concepts and sustainable smart city development, and exploring further collaboration to create more opportunities for the industries and enterprises of the three places.""

 Ms Ho will return to Hong Kong tomorrow morning (July 6)."

何永賢上午與負責房屋政策、經濟及旅遊事務的巴塞羅那副市長Jordi Valls Riera會面，就房屋政策、建屋科技等範疇交流。何永賢分享由香港政府主導的「簡約公屋」以「組裝合成」建築法（MiC）快速興建，其中位於元朗攸壆路的首個「簡約公屋」項目，建築期只需約一年，而首個高至19層有升降機的牛頭角彩興路項目，第一期更以少於一年半的時間便落成，破了香港快速興建高層建築的紀錄。她亦分享了房屋局及香港房屋委員會（房委會）透過不斷優化置業階梯，讓更多年輕人、家庭循房屋階梯上進上流。她表示，房屋局今年十一月在香港舉行國際性研討會，向世界展示內地和香港建築科技的最新發展，希望到時世界各地的朋友都可以參加該研討會。

其後，何永賢參觀了一個社會房屋項目Modulus Matrix: 85 Social Housing。該項目採用木結構興建以減少碳排放，並以模組化設計縮短施工時間。

下午，何永賢參觀一個由貨櫃改裝而成的社會房屋項目APROP-Glòries，為有需要市民提供臨時居所。她表示，香港和巴塞羅那政府均致力以靈活務實的方法增加房屋供應，為有迫切住屋需要的家庭提供安居之所，她期望兩地就相關政策保持緊密交流。

何永賢隨後禮節性拜會中華人民共和國駐巴塞羅那總領事孟宇宏，向她介紹房屋局現正積極推行的各種房屋措施，包括借力粵港澳大灣區內地城市，推進建屋科技發展。

何永賢今日（巴塞羅那時間七月五日）參觀了另一個社會房屋項目72 Social Housing Units，實地了解當地如何透過建築設計打造樸素、宜居，並具能源效益的居住環境。

何永賢在總結訪問行程時表示：「香港擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，具備連繫大灣區的優越地理位置，是次訪問正正發揮香港作為『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的重要功能。我期望能與葡萄牙和西班牙就創新建築科技、以人為本的『幸福設計』及可持續智慧城市發展等領域保持緊密交流，並探討如何進一步加強合作，為三地業界和企業拓展機遇。」

Mr Roden Tong (President of the Law Society of Hong Kong), Mr Liu Chunhua (Director-General of the Department of Law of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Mr Cao Hailei (Deputy Director of the Justice Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality),

Good morning everyone! It is my great pleasure to join you at today's opening ceremony of ""Teen Talk GBA Study Tour 2025"" organised by the Law Society of Hong Kong.

Our youth today are the leaders of tomorrow. I am pleased to note that the Law Society has empowered over 18 000 students through Teen Talk since 2009, fostering essential values such as empathy, team work and respect for the rule of law.

In recent years, the Greater Bay Area (GBA) has emerged as one of the world's most significant economic zones. This dynamic region represents the successful collaboration between Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, leveraging their complementary strengths to create exceptional opportunities for talented individuals like yourselves.

As Asia-Pacific's premier hub for international legal services, Hong Kong's established common law tradition provides distinctive expertise in bridging different legal systems. We should leverage our unique advantages and reinforce our connectivity with both the Mainland and the world, offering our unique contribution as the GBA continues its remarkable development.

It is therefore most timely for the Law Society to organise this second edition of cross-boundary Study Tour to Shenzhen. I would also like to welcome our participants assembled here today. Over the next two days, you will visit leading institutions, as Roden has mentioned, including the Qianhai People's Court and the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration, gaining valuable insights into cross-jurisdictional legal systems. I am sure that the volunteer solicitors who are joining today will be most happy to share their experience and broaden your understanding of legal practice.

I encourage you to approach this unique experience with intellectual curiosity, and embrace this opportunity for learning and meaningful exchanges.

I wish you all a highly successful and fruitful study tour. Enjoy!"

各位朋友，早晨。首先很歡迎大家出席今日的法治教育領袖培訓計劃基礎課程。轉眼間，今日已經是第三年舉辦計劃。三年來都經歷了一些事情，今年可以說是有新有舊、新舊交替。

第一個新舊交替是我們的星級嘉賓陣容，有自從我們成立了法治教育委員會和開展法治教育培訓教育之後的「鐵粉」和忠實支持者——德高望重的陳兆愷法官。第二位，一樣德高望重的當然是Starry李慧琼，她不只支持，一會兒亦會和我一起跟大家分享。第三位就是在大學時讀書比我出色很多的簡慧敏議員。這些是舊朋友。但是今日很榮幸有幾位新朋友，有法治教育督導委員會的新成員何建宗博士Henry，他與我相識多年。今日有教育大學的朋友積極參與，有顧敏康博士，我有拜讀他的著作。

第二個新舊交替就是我們成員的背景，今日大概有120位朋友參加課程，大概有一半是來自18區的青年事務委員會。過去幾年，其實都曾邀請過他們，但似乎都是供不應求，所以希望今年可以補足過去的一些不足，這是舊的部分，或者稱為已經在做的部分，但部分新的東西是今年的新嘗試，很高興得到教育大學的支持，邀請到大約60位不同班級的教育大學朋友參加今日的課程，所以這是一個新的嘗試。

第三個新舊交替，就是內容和講者，關於課程內容，當然大致上是承接過去兩年的經驗，有些我們覺得是值得保留會再繼續做，但我們會與時並進，亦有加入了一些新內容和大家分享。至於講者，今日暫時是舊的，就是我和很有經驗的講者李慧琼Starry，但是下星期就會有新面孔，下星期再和大家說。所以這就是三個方面的新舊交替。

在新舊交替之餘，有一樣東西是三年來都沒有改變的，就是舉辦這個法治教育培訓計劃的目的和理念。我想花一點時間去解釋為甚麼要舉辦這個計劃，為甚麼要花你們兩個周末的時間。目標很簡單，顧名思義，就是希望培養一些法治教育的領袖。法治是甚麼呢？剛才同事也說了，在香港是不會有爭議的，我們都覺得香港是一個法治的社會，這件事很珍貴，亦可以說是我們的金漆招牌。但是法治最重要的不是法律知識，而是法治的概念和意識，是一些價值觀。價值觀的特性是甚麼呢？就等於其他價值觀，就是做人要孝順、要勤勞，是要從小培養的一些事情。

那麼如果要培養尤其是香港下一代有這樣的價值觀，哪些人最適合做這項工作呢？答案一定是最有機會接觸年青人的朋友，這包括今日出席的兩批人——負責青年事務的朋友以及未來的老師。他們自己也是年青人，所以這是很順理成章的事情。大家亦理解，無論是從事青年工作也好，或者是未來的老師也好，今時今日已經有很多相關的責任給了你們，可能大家也耳熟能詳，我們需要教授下一代，或者自己也要認識多一點國家的憲法、《基本法》，甚至是國安法的相關知識。我也很理解大家本身已有自己的工作或專長，法律不是你們很熟悉的事情，也不是你們的專長。我相信你心底也難免會有一定的疑慮或者擔心，覺得自己是否應付得來呢？是否真的可以做到這個責任，將一些相關的知識傳授給學生及其他青年朋友呢？

事實上教育局或其他機構都做了很多功夫，為大家提供了很多書面教材或其他資料幫助大家。這些是很正面的，但是我覺得要警惕一事，這也是為何我要親自跟大家交流一下。千萬不要太過依賴教材，變成一部「人肉錄音機」——就是拿着教材由頭讀到尾，讀完放下便算，這是要避免及盡量不要做的事情。要不當成「人肉錄音機」，我想有兩件事情是要做到和自己也要擁有的，就是兩個「信」字。第一是要有信念，真誠信念。你不相信那事情，你是不會教得好的。例如你不明白、不相信孝順是一種美德的話，你很難解釋給別人聽為何孝順是一件好的事情。所以你要對法治或者整個法治概念有真誠的信念，相信這事情是好的，相信這對香港是很重要的事情。所以第一是真誠的信念。

第二是要有足夠的信心。你有信心才會放膽說，不會有很多避忌，或者怕說錯就盡量少說一點，甚至依書直說便算，所以真誠的信念和足夠的信心是很關鍵的。這些道理說說當然容易，但要有信念和信心，當然不是那麼簡單，也不可以如「清兵」一樣心口寫個「勇」字便行。信念也好，信心也好，都要有一個客觀的基礎，這就是這個課程的目的。我很希望透過這個計劃，用兩個周末的時間，以一個比較全面的方法，嘗試由淺入深、化繁為簡，增加大家對於我們整個法治環境的信念，增加大家向其他人介紹這方面知識的一些信心。

我以前打過一個比喻，這個課程是等於派了一顆「定心丸」給大家，替大家打支「強心針」，讓大家更加有信心和信念去履行將來向其他人傳授法治理念的工作。當然，在座也有老師和其他人，一會兒我也會扮演這個角色，「班門弄斧」一下，但是除了講課之外，我是希望多一點互動的元素。

我鼓勵大家除了聆聽我和Starry講話之外，也可以一邊聆聽一邊思考，如果有甚麼問題的話，稍後有很多機會給大家討論，還有發問及回應問題環節。今日我們也邀請了過去兩年參加課程的學員擔任小組組長，引導大家做小組討論。我認為教學相長是要互動的，所以你們心裏面有甚麼疑問和問題，就算是你平時不敢問的，今日你絕對可以問。你「夠膽」問，我便「夠膽」回答，我是願意回答的。最後，希望經過這兩個周末之後，大家不會認為是浪費了兩個寶貴的周末，是有所得着，讓大家增加對法治的信念，讓大家更加有信心去履行你們將來的一些責任和工作。祝大家有個愉快、充實的周末，多謝大家。"

各位朋友，早晨。首先很歡迎大家出席今日的法治教育領袖培訓計劃基礎課程。轉眼間，今日已經是第三年舉辦計劃。三年來都經歷了一些事情，今年可以說是有新有舊、新舊交替。

第一個新舊交替是我們的星級嘉賓陣容，有自從我們成立了法治教育委員會和開展法治教育培訓教育之後的「鐵粉」和忠實支持者——德高望重的陳兆愷法官。第二位，一樣德高望重的當然是Starry李慧琼，她不只支持，一會兒亦會和我一起跟大家分享。第三位就是在大學時讀書比我出色很多的簡慧敏議員。這些是舊朋友。但是今日很榮幸有幾位新朋友，有法治教育督導委員會的新成員何建宗博士Henry，他與我相識多年。今日有教育大學的朋友積極參與，有顧敏康博士，我有拜讀他的著作。

第二個新舊交替就是我們成員的背景，今日大概有120位朋友參加課程，大概有一半是來自18區的青年事務委員會。過去幾年，其實都曾邀請過他們，但似乎都是供不應求，所以希望今年可以補足過去的一些不足，這是舊的部分，或者稱為已經在做的部分，但部分新的東西是今年的新嘗試，很高興得到教育大學的支持，邀請到大約60位不同班級的教育大學朋友參加今日的課程，所以這是一個新的嘗試。

第三個新舊交替，就是內容和講者，關於課程內容，當然大致上是承接過去兩年的經驗，有些我們覺得是值得保留會再繼續做，但我們會與時並進，亦有加入了一些新內容和大家分享。至於講者，今日暫時是舊的，就是我和很有經驗的講者李慧琼Starry，但是下星期就會有新面孔，下星期再和大家說。所以這就是三個方面的新舊交替。

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-07-05 11:14,2025-07-05 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500323.htm,"  âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.
  
  Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.
  
  The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.
  
  A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.
  
  Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.
  
  The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."

藍國慶主席（香港善德基金會主席）、董吳玲玲主席（香港善德基金會榮譽主席）、各位嘉賓、各位同學：

大家好，我很高興通過視頻參與善德關愛科研青年發展計劃的北京、西安航天科技考察團啟動禮。

今年四月二十四日，是第十個「中國航天日」，亦是國家發射第一顆人造衞星的55周年紀念日。數十年以來，國家航天事業取得了舉世矚目的成就——從「嫦娥」探月、「天問」探火，到「天宮」空間站的建成，都展示了國家建設航天強國的堅實步伐。

香港善德基金會緊扣時代脈搏，除了熱心推動社會公益事業，亦通過舉辦創科和文化交流活動，培養香港年輕一代的家國情懷和創新精神。

基金會自二○一五年起持續舉辦國家航天科技考察團。同學們通過參觀國家級的航天和科研機構、歷史名勝等，親身見證國家航天及創科發展的輝煌成就，同時增進對國家歷史文化的認識。我肯定基金會多年來的工作和努力。

特區政府積極配合國家教育強國建設規劃，持續加強在學校推動STEAM（科學、科技、工程、藝術和數學）及創科教育，從小培養學生對科學和創新科技的興趣和能力。

新開設的小學科學科課程和更新的初中科學科課程，將會加強航天與創新科技元素，提升學生對國家航天事業的了解，激發他們探索浩瀚宇宙的熱情。

在國家的支持下，香港的大學科研團隊多次參與國家的航天任務，為國家的航天事業發展貢獻力量。特區政府在InnoHK創新香港研發平台下成立了香港太空機械人與能源中心，由多所香港和內地大學，以及航天機構合作，為國家的嫦娥八號探月任務作出貢獻。

此外，獲選為國家預備航天員的香港載荷專家，最快於下年首次執行飛行任務。這次是首次有港人獲選為國家預備航天員，不但標誌着國家對香港科研人才實力的肯定，更證明年輕人只要積極裝備自己，以堅毅不屈的精神追求理想，航天夢絕非遙不可及。

同學們，這次考察團不但是一次學習之旅，更是一次為夢想播種的旅程。我期望你們以這次創科考察為起點，將對航天的熱情轉化為不斷學習的動力，自強不息，貢獻國家、造福社會。

最後，我預祝航天科技考察團圓滿成功，各位同學滿載而歸，在座各位身體健康，生活愉快。多謝大家。"
勞工及福利局局長就補充勞工優化計劃以及大班麵包西餅和鴻星海鮮酒家結業事件會見傳媒談話內容,2025-07-05 10:31,2025-07-05 10:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500288.htm,"​以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（七月五日）上午出席電台節目後，就補充勞工優化計劃以及大班麵包西餅和鴻星海鮮酒家結業事件會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：剛才講到有些大企業會一併計算員工總數以符合二比一這比例，勞工處會如何巡查？

勞工及福利局局長：就聘用輸入勞工企業的全職本地僱員與輸入勞工人手比例不得多於二比一這規定，確是以整間公司總人數計算，不僅限於大企業，所有申請補充勞工優化計劃的企業均按這標準處理。這不是新安排，原有補充勞工計劃下的人手比例亦是按這規定來做。

記者：如何預防企業濫用這比例，或以其他方式迴避？

勞工及福利局局長：企業無法濫用，機制下的兩名本地僱員指的是長工，長工有清晰定義，即每星期工時須達35小時或以上，短工、兼職工及散工不會計算在內。

記者：想問大班結業方面，該數千萬元欠款是否通過破欠基金處理？

勞工及福利局局長：就大班麵包西餅的個案，勞工處同事正協助受影響工友通過破產欠薪保障基金（破欠基金）取回被拖欠的薪金、代通知金及未放假期薪酬等，若有拖欠遣散費，亦可通過這途徑申領。

記者：鴻星方面，有否聯絡到僱主，是否知悉他們的意向？

勞工及福利局局長：鴻星海鮮酒家結業方面，已有約50名工友向勞工處登記求助。勞工處正與鴻星管理層商討，提醒其在《僱傭條例》下作為僱主應履行的責任，包括支付薪金及遣散費等。當然，若我們確定僱主無力償還或清付這些款項，我們會協助工友通過破欠基金取回他們應得的款額。

Remarks by SLW on Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme and database on carers,2025-07-05 10:25,2025-07-05 10:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/05/P2025070500280.htm,"Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, on Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme and database on carers at a media session after attending a radio programme today morning (July 5):

Reporter: Secretary, you mentioned that the Government will impose or set strict limits on hiring non-local workers, even in sectors with higher jobless rate, like catering. How can we ensure that the local recruits are getting priority on employment? You mentioned that since mid-June, there is an introduction of the four enhanced measures to prioritise local workers, has there been noticeable increase in the number of rejected applications? Also, I would like to ask about the pilot scheme to reach out to the elderly households, could you disclose more on how exactly the Government would collect those data and implement them to help those in need?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme, the design of the system is based on some important principles, in which the most important one is to ensure that local workers are given the priority to get employed first. This is achieved through the four-week local recruitment exercise. Once an employer put up an application, first of all they have to recruit locally for four weeks. That is a very vigorous process. They have to interview every local worker applied for the job. Even if he or she is not employed, the Labour Department will give them a call to make sure that they have not been mistreated. If we found out during that process that the local workers have the willingness to work and somehow the employer has not been treating him or her in a fair manner, this would possibly result in the rejection of the application for importation of labour for that employer. I just want to assure you that the whole system is a very vigorous one and we are going to make sure that the local workers are fully protected and given the priority to get employed first. It is only after that the employer has proven to us that it is not able to recruit enough workers locally, then we would consider its application for importation of labour.

  As for the pilot scheme to make use of big data to identify earlier on families that are at risk, we are going to roll out in the coming weeks. First of all we will focus on efforts in a smaller scale, starting with beneficiaries of the Scheme on Living Allowance for Low-income Carers of Persons with Disabilities, we are talking about thousands of families who are at higher risks. An example is if the carer has been admitted into hospital, under our new pilot scheme, a message would be given from the Hospital Authority to the Social Welfare Department signaling that the said family is now at risk, so that we can reach out to it to provide necessary respite service or home service to make sure those being taken care of is receiving proper care, to ensure that the risk is properly managed and all the necessary care has been given to them. Thank you very much.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"

""The public should carry and drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration while engaging in outdoor activities,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

""Those engaged in strenuous outdoor activities should avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcohol, as they speed up water loss through the urinary system,"" the spokesman explained.

""Infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, those with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and individuals who are overweight are more vulnerable to heat stroke. They should pay special attention,"" the spokesman added.

The public should adopt the following precautions:


Wear loose and light-coloured clothing to reduce heat absorption and facilitate sweat evaporation and heat dissipation;
Avoid vigorous exercise and prolonged activities like hiking or trekking as heat, sweating and exhaustion can place additional demands on the physique;
Perform outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible;
For indoor activities, open all windows, use a fan or use air-conditioning to maintain good ventilation;
Do not stay inside a parked vehicle; and
Reschedule work to cooler times of the day if feasible. If working in a hot environment is inevitable, introduce shade in the workplace where practicable. Start work slowly and pick up the pace gradually. Move to a cool area for rest at regular intervals to allow the body to recuperate.


âThe public should also note the latest and the forecast Ultraviolet (UV) Index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV Index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct exposure of the skin and the eyes to sunlight;
Apply a broad-spectrum water-resistant sunscreen product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply every two hours if you need to stay outdoors for a prolonged period, or after swimming, sweating or towelling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear long-sleeved and loose-fitting clothes; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

Buildings Department takes enforcement action against illegal domestic units in industrial building,2025-07-04 22:51,2025-07-04 23:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400968.htm,"âRegarding the fire incident in an industrial building at 21 Ma Tau Wai Road, Hung Hom, yesterday (July 3), it was suspected that the unit concerned had been subdivided for illegal domestic use. The Buildings Department (BD) was very concerned about this matter, and launched an investigation immediately. If any unlawful act is found, the BD will consider instigating prosecution against the relevant persons.

  ""The design, approval of building plans and construction of industrial buildings are intended solely for industrial use. Since the units in industrial buildings are used for industrial activities, including the storage of dangerous and flammable items, illegal conversion of industrial buildings to domestic use poses serious safety risks to users. No one should reside in industrial buildings. Persons involved in sales and rental activities, such as prospective buyers and tenants as well as estate agents, should check the approved use of the units. An industrial unit should not be used for domestic purposes,"" a spokesman for the BD said.

Following the fire incident yesterday, the BD has deployed its staff to carry out a site inspection. Officers at the scene found that the unit concerned was subdivided into a number of smaller units, and some of them were illegally used for domestic purposes. The BD has served statutory orders in accordance with section 25 (2) and section 26(1) of the Buildings Ordinance (BO) to order the owner to discontinue the use of the unit for domestic purposes and rectify the dangerous situation. The BD will continue its investigation. If anyone is found in contravention of the BO, the BD will follow up seriously, including considering prosecution against the relevant persons. In addition, the BD will include the building in its large-scale operation against domestic use in industrial buildings and will arrange to inspect the other units of the building in phases.

Failure to comply with a discontinuation order served under section 25(2) or a repair order served under section 26(1) of the BO without reasonable excuse are serious offences. Upon conviction, the offender is liable to a maximum fine at level 5 (currently $50,000) and imprisonment for one year, and a further fine of $5,000 for each day that the offence continues.

To ascertain the approved use of the premises, apart from obtaining independent professional advice, members of the public may obtain relevant information by checking the occupation permit and approved building plans of the building via the Building Records Access and Viewing On-line system of the BD if they are in doubt.

The Government is finalising the proposals to amend the BO and drafting the legislative amendments, including criminalising the subdivision of units in industrial buildings for domestic uses to enhance deterrence. The Government aims to submit the amendment bill to the Legislative Council in the first half of 2026."

委員普遍支持政府透過重新規劃將紅磡站周邊和海濱一帶用地打造成海濱新地標，從而豐富公眾及旅客於維多利亞港的體驗。委員同意於發展內提供例如餐飲零售等商業元素，並提議為土地用途提供最大的彈性，容許日後發展商可以因應將來的市場環境調整不同類型的商業用途分布。

委員欣悉有關建議將優化行人通達性，包括由北至南（即由內陸至海濱）以及東至西（即紅磡與尖沙咀東之間）兩個方向，並建議進一步研究如何加強連接性，例如與紅磡及尖沙咀東其他已發展但不屬於研究範圍內的區域，並加入更多創新的城市設計元素。在水體運用方面，委員支持於前紅磡貨運碼頭用地毗鄰的水體提供遊艇停泊設施，以應對泊位短缺的問題。委員亦建議政府考慮提供更多便利措施的需要，以配合有關的發展建議，以便更好地推廣遊艇旅遊以及推動遊艇業的發展，並確保公眾能夠享用海濱。

政府會考慮委員的建議及將於七月初完結的諮詢期間所收集到的意見，以優化發展計劃及敲定詳細發展參數，目標是在二○二六年下半年開展相關的法定程序。

就政府建議透過拆牆鬆綁鼓勵商廈改裝成學生宿舍，委員歡迎增加宿位供應的擬議便利措施，讓香港更好地把握未來機遇，加強其作為國際專上教育樞紐的地位。這些措施包括擴展城規制度下「酒店」的用途定義以涵蓋擬議計劃下合資格的學生宿舍；以及為由商廈改裝而成的合資格學生宿舍提供地積比、上蓋面積，以及豁免總樓面面積等寬免措施。委員認為擬議的計劃合符時勢，透過拆牆鬆綁善用市場力量，既在短期內增加宿舍供應之餘，亦有助更有效運用現時市場上商廈的空間。

政府會繼續向業界及持份者簡介擬議的計劃，並預計在今年七月中正式推出計劃。

此外，政府在會上向委員匯報了有關地政總署精簡土地交易流程的最新措施，以提高有關契約修訂、換地申請、私人協約批地，以及其他土地交易的審批流程的透明度和確定性。委員歡迎地政總署的措施，以闡明處理土地交易中主要步驟的審批時間目標。"

The case involved a 38-year-old male passenger arriving in Hong Kong from Bangkok, Thailand, today. During customs clearance, Customs officers found the batch of suspected cannabis buds and vapes containing suspected cannabis oil in his two check-in suitcases. The man was subsequently arrested.

The arrested person has been charged with one count of trafficking in a dangerous drug. The case will be brought up at the Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts tomorrow (July 5).

Customs will continue to step up enforcement against drug trafficking activities through intelligence analysis. The department also reminds members of the public to stay alert and not to participate in drug trafficking activities for monetary return. They must not accept hiring or delegation from another party to carry controlled items into and out of Hong Kong. They are also reminded not to carry unknown items for other people.

Customs will continue to apply a risk assessment approach and focus on selecting passengers from high-risk regions for clearance to combat transnational drug trafficking activities.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
HKSAR Government spokesman: statement on HKNSL by former Court of Final Appeal non-permanent judge Brenda Hale far from truth,2025-07-04 20:31,2025-07-04 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400780.htm,"A spokesman of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (July 4) said that the statement made by the former non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), Brenda Hale, on the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the rule of law and independent judicial power in Hong Kong is far from the truth, particularly her assertion that the so-called ""the National Security Law has taken over the Basic Law"" is absolutely incorrect and contrary to the facts.

Brenda Hale was appointed as a non-permanent judge of the CFA in 2018 but has never been involved in the hearing of any cases. She indicated to the Judiciary in June 2021 that, for personal reasons, she would not wish to have her appointment extended for another term upon the expiry of her then appointment, which differs from her current statement.

The HKSAR Government spokesman said that any claims that the HKNSL overrides the Basic Law are incorrect. Article 1 of the HKNSL clearly states that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) enacts the HKNSL in accordance with the Constitution, the Basic Law, and the Decision of the National People's Congress on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanisms for Safeguarding National Security in the HKSAR. The HKNSL was promulgated and implemented in the HKSAR on June 30, 2020, which has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR. The HKNSL and other laws in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR firmly adhere to the principle of the rule of law while protecting the rights and freedoms enjoyed under the Basic Law in accordance with the law.

The judicial system of the HKSAR is protected by the Basic Law. According to Articles 2, 19 and 85 of the Basic Law, the HKSAR shall be vested with independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication; the courts shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. All judges and judicial officers abide by the Judicial Oath and administer justice in full accordance with the law, without fear or favour, self-interest or deceit.When adjudicating cases of offences endangering national security, as in any other cases, judges remain independent and impartial in performing their judicial duties, free from any interference. The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven that the courts have handled all the cases involving the HKNSL strictly in accordance with the above principles.

The authority of the NPCSC to interpret the Basic Law and national laws that apply in the HKSAR is a fundamental aspect of the ""one country, two systems"" principle and has long been recognised in the jurisprudence of the HKSAR.It is therefore entirely in line with the ""one country, two systems"" principle that the general power to interpret the HKNSL being a piece of national law, as stipulated in Article 65 thereof, is also vested in the NPCSC. The interpretation given by the NPCSC on Articles 14 and 47 of the HKNSL in December 2022 does not and did not directly deal with any specific judicial proceedings or cases. Rather, it clarifies the meaning of the relevant legal provisions and the basis for application of the HKNSL. It does not in any way impair the independent judicial power and the power of final adjudication of the HKSAR courts as guaranteed by the Basic Law. It is for the HKSAR to resolve specific cases and issues by itself.

The long-time presence of esteemed judges from overseas appointed or reappointed as non-permanent judges of the CFA participating in hearings of the Court, as well as after the enactment of the HKNSL, has been conducive to the international legal environment and the development of the jurisprudence of common law in Hong Kong. There are currently six non-permanent judges from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand in the CFA."

在典禮上，語常會主席陳黃麗娟博士表示，語常會在語文教育上展現出擁抱科技進步的決心，而這份決心促使語常會組織、撥款支持和主辦是次高峰會。高峰會充當一個創新和探索的協作平台，是香港首批聚焦應用人工智能於教育的國際活動之一。

她指出，人工智能在個性化學習和提升語言習得方面具有轉化潛力。她強調通過有效策略、道德考量和學生為本的方式來引導科技發展的重要性，並鼓勵與會者一同塑造人工智能語言學習的未來，確保人工智能成為教育的促進者而非人際互動的替代品。

香港理工大學校長滕錦光教授在歡迎辭中回應蔡若蓮博士，表示香港在全球人工智能教育和技術驅動學習方面，具有獨特的優勢。他指出，香港擁有世界一流的教育體系、著名的大學，並發展成為國際創新科技中心以及國際專上教育樞紐。

他表示，理大一直致力推動人工智能於教育領域的發展，率先於二○二二年把人工智能納入本科生必修課程，並於今年成立計算機及數學科學學院、理大人工智能高等研究院及語言教學部。這一系列舉措充分展現理大在人工智能賦能教育和研究方面的遠見和領導地位。他期望是次峰會能激發更多具啓發性的想法與協作，重塑香港人工智能教育的發展。

香港教育城董事會主席李漢祥在演講中指，教城致力推動跨界協作，構建完善的人工智能教育生態圈並促進數字教育發展。為加速教育數碼轉型，教城正全力籌備創新電子教學工具超級貨架EdMarket，搜羅包括嶄新人工智能教學工具等全球優質電子教育資源，豐富及啓發創新的學與教模式。

EDB's first Digital Education Week launches International Summit on Use of AI in Learning and Teaching Languages and Other Subjects (with photos),2025-07-04 20:27,2025-07-04 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400769.htm,"âDigital Education Week 2025 (DEW) is a landmark event promoting the development of digital education by the Education Bureau (EDB). A flagship event of the first DEW, the International Summit on the Use of AI in Learning and Teaching Languages and Other Subjects (AIinLT), was officially launched today (July 4). The AIinLT is co-organised by the EDB, the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR), the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) Department of English and Communication and the Hong Kong Education City (EdCity), providing a valuable and practical platform for teachers, researchers, and others in the education sector to learn and share insights regarding the use of AI in their respective fields of education.

Officiating at the opening ceremony, the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, said that the country placed great importance on advancing digital education. The EDB also implements digital education through four major focus areas, namely:

1. enhancing students' digital literacy and skills to prepare them as responsible citizens and lifelong learners;
2. strengthening professional training in digital education for teachers and encouraging schools to leverage innovative technologies;
3. optimising digital education infrastructure and fostering personalized learning; and
4. expanding cross-border and international collaboration to enhance synergy and promote high-quality digital education development.

Dr Choi also called for collaboration among all stakeholders - including the Government, educational institutions, educators, and the community - to optimise resources, share best practices, and maximise the impact of digital education. She also emphasised the irreplaceable role of human connections in learning, encouraging attendees to harness AI wisely to empower individuals, strengthen communities and build a smarter, more connected world of learning.

At the ceremony, the Chairperson of SCOLAR, Dr Anissa Chan, said that SCOLAR is committed to embracing technological advancements in language education. She noted that this commitment was what inspired SCOLAR to organise, finance and host the AIinLT, which is one of the first international events in Hong Kong focusing on the use of AI in education. The AIinLT serves as a collaborative platform for innovation and exploration.

Dr Chan also spoke on the transformative potential of AI in personalising learning and enhancing language acquisition. She stressed the importance of guiding technological development through effective strategies, ethical considerations, and a learner-centred approach. She encouraged participants to shape the future of smart language learning, ensuring that AI serves as an enabler in education rather than a replacement for human interaction.

In his welcome remarks, the President of PolyU, Professor Teng Jinguang, echoed Dr Choi and said that the city of Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to be a global leader in AI-powered education and technology-driven learning, given its world-class education system, renowned universities, and its development into an international innovation and technology centre and international hub for post-secondary education.

He added that PolyU has been promoting the development of AI in education. PolyU was a forerunner university to introduce compulsory AI education for undergraduates back in 2022, and established this year the Faculty of Computer and Mathematical Sciences, the PolyU Academy for Artificial Intelligence as well as the Language Education Institute. All these efforts underscore PolyU's far-sightedness and leadership in AI-empowered education and research. He expects that this event will spark meaningful ideas and collaborations that will help reshape AI in education in Hong Kong.

In his address, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hong Kong Education City, Mr Armstrong Lee, emphasised EdCity's unwavering commitment to fostering cross-sector collaboration aimed at establishing a robust AI education ecosystem that propels the advancement of digital education. To expedite the digital transformation of educational practices, EdCity is developing the ""EdMarket,"" an innovative super-shelf for electronic teaching tools. This platform will feature a diverse array of high-quality global educational resources, including pioneering AI teaching tools designed to enrich and inspire transformative teaching and learning methodologies.

The AIinLT is taking place at PolyU for four consecutive days starting from today. The AIinLT on the first two days feature keynote speeches, a panel discussion, paper presentations, and teaching demonstrations. The following two days will include a post-summit workshop series covering a wide range of topics, along with a technology showcase where leading EdTech providers will demonstrate the latest AI hardware and software solutions, offering educators firsthand exposure to cutting edge-innovations.

The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, and the Secretary for Education, Dr Choi Yuk-lin, officiated at the event. Around 2 000 representatives from school sponsoring bodies, school councils, school head associations, schools and parent-teacher associations attended.

Mr Cheuk said, ""On the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, we have gained a deeper understanding of the importance of safeguarding national security and promoting patriotic education. When you love your country, you will naturally and consciously safeguard its security. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has consistently promoted mainstream values centred on patriotism and love for Hong Kong, which align with the principle of 'one country, two systems'. In April last year, the Working Group on Patriotic Education, chaired by the Chief Secretary for Administration, was established to deepen public understanding and appreciation of our nation and the richness of Chinese culture, and to systematically integrate patriotic education into the national education framework. The 'Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0' joint school national education series is a fine example of how the education sector has responded positively to this initiative and worked together to promote patriotic education.""

He continued, ""Tonight's performance of the 'Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country' gala is not only a showcase of the fruitful achievements over the past year but also a valuable opportunity for our students to demonstrate their confidence and talents on stage. We are fortunate to live in an era of national prosperity and strength, and our country has shown particular care for the HKSAR - the most recent example being the Shandong Naval Taskforce's visit to Hong Kong, marking the country's first-ever open-door naval visit. I hope students will turn the knowledge and experiences gained from the 'Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country' activities into positive values and meaningful actions - actively practising the spirit of patriotism and love for Hong Kong. I also hope they will aspire to become a new generation of idealistic, courageous individuals with a strong Hong Kong spirit and national pride, contributing their youthful passion and strength to the cause of national unity and solidarity.""

Mr Cheuk also expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the school sponsoring bodies, school councils, colleagues in the education sector, co-operating organisations, and community partners for their unwavering efforts in promoting patriotic education.

This school year's ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country"" joint school national education activities were scaled up and more diversified than those of last year, with total attendance exceeding 40 000. Apart from teachers and students, some activities also invited parents, experts from different sectors and members of the public to enhance understanding of national education among different stakeholders. The activities included Chinese cultural experiences, learning of intangible cultural heritage skills, visual arts and innovation exhibitions, competitions, and enquiry-based studies on themes aligned with national policies. These activities allowed students to appreciate the richness of Chinese heritage, cultivate affection for their home and country, and build a strong sense of national pride.

Today's gala marked the grand finale of the ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country 3.0"" series, which also celebrated the fifth anniversary of the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, and the 28th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. About 300 students participated in the performances, including the flag-raising ceremony and Chinese-style foot drill by joint school flag guards, music, dance, dragon and flag dance, as well as Cantonese opera performance, all showcasing students' fruitful learning achievements.

The EDB will continue to promote ""Love Our Home, Treasure Our Country"" joint school national education activities in the 2025/26 school year and organise more diversified learning activities to advance national education. These efforts will nurture young people into quality citizens with a strong sense of social responsibility and national identity, as well as a deep affection for Hong Kong."

屋宇署發言人表示：「工業大廈的設計、圖則審批和建造，只擬作工業用途。由於工業樓宇內的單位會用作工業活動，包括用以儲存危險及易燃物品，把工業樓宇非法改作住用用途會對用戶構成嚴重的安全風險。因此，任何人士均不應在工業樓宇內居住。參與樓宇買賣及租務活動的人士，包括準買家、租戶和地產代理等，亦應查明單位的批准用途，不應把工業用途的單位作住用用途。」

就昨日的火警事故，屋宇署已派員到涉事單位展開調查，發現涉事單位被分間為多個細單位，部分分間單位被非法用作住用用途。署方已根據《建築物條例》（《條例》）第25（2）條及26（1）條向有關業主發出法定命令，着令中止將該單位用作住用用途及糾正危險情況。署方會繼續進行調查，如發現有人違反《條例》，定必嚴肅跟進，包括考慮向相關人士提出檢控。此外，屋宇署會把該幢樓宇納入針對工業大廈被非法用作住用用途的大規模行動，安排分批巡查該樓宇的其他單位。

任何人無合理辯解而沒有遵從根據《條例》第25（2）條發出的中止用途命令或第26（1）條發出的修葺令屬嚴重罪行。一經定罪，最高可處第五級罰款（目前為五萬元）及監禁一年，及可就罪行持續的每一天，另處罰款五千元。

公眾如對樓宇的批准用途有疑問，除可徵詢專業人士的意見外，亦可透過屋宇署的「百樓圖網」系統查閱有關樓宇的佔用許可證及批准建築圖則，以核實有關處所的批准用途。

政府正敲定修訂《條例》的最終建議，並草擬修訂法例，包括將工廈分間單位用作住用用途刑事化，以加強阻嚇力。政府的目標是在二○二六年上半年向立法會提交修訂條例草案。"

Land and Development Advisory Committee holds meeting,2025-07-04 19:56,2025-07-04 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400788.htm,"At its meeting today (July 4), the Land and Development Advisory Committee (LDAC) was briefed by the Government on the preliminary development proposal of sites around Hung Hom Station and its waterfront areas, and the proposed scheme to be launched jointly by the Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Education Bureau (EDB) to encourage the market to convert commercial buildings into student hostels.

Members generally welcomed the Government's proposal to transform the sites around Hung Hom Station and its waterfront areas into a new harbourfront landmark through replanning, thereby enriching the public and tourists' enjoyment of the Victoria Harbour. While agreeing that commercial elements such as retail and dining should be provided in the development, Members suggested that land use flexibility should be maximised to allow the future developer(s) to adjust the mix of different types of commercial use in the future having regard to the prevailing market environment.

Members appreciated that the proposal would improve the pedestrian connectivity in both the north-south (from hinterland to waterfront) and east-west (between Hung Hom and Tsim Sha Tsui East) directions, but suggested further studies be conducted to explore further strengthening connectivity, say with other developed areas of Hung Hom and Tsim Sha Tsui East that were currently outside the scope of the study, and to incorporate innovative urban design elements. On the utilisation of water body, Members were in support of the idea of providing yacht berthing facilities at the water body adjacent to the former Hung Hom Freight Yard site to address the shortage of berths. Members also recommended the Government consider the need for formulating more facilitating measures to complement the development proposal to better promote yacht tourism and facilitate the development of the yacht industry, and to ensure that the general public would be able to enjoy the harborfront.

The Government will take into account Members' recommendations and the feedback received during the consultation period to be ended in early July when refining the proposal and finalising the detailed development parameters. The aim is to commence the relevant statutory procedures in the second half of 2026.

On the Government's proposal to streamline development control procedures to encourage conversion of commercial buildings into student hostels, Members welcomed the proposed facilitation measures to boost the supply of hostel accommodation to enable Hong Kong to better grasp opportunities ahead to reinforce its position as an international post-secondary education hub. These measures include expanding the definition of 'Hotel' use under the planning regime to cover eligible student hostels under the proposed scheme; and providing concessions for eligible student hostels converted from commercial buildings with regard to plot ratio, site coverage, and exempted gross floor area, etc. Members considered the proposed scheme timely and relevant, and would leverage market forces through streamlining development procedures to boost hostel supply in the short run on the one hand, and facilitating more effective use of the commercial building stock currently in the market on the other.

The Government will continue to brief the trade and stakeholders on the proposed scheme, which is expected to be rolled out in mid-July this year.

In addition, Members were briefed by the Lands Department on the latest measures to enhance transparency and provide more certainty with regard to the processing of applications for lease modifications, land exchange, private treaty grant and other land transactions. Members welcomed the Lands Department's initiative to set out time targets for certain key steps in the processing of land transactions."
CFS continues to follow up on imported turkey bacon with possible contamination of Listeria monocytogene,2025-07-04 19:32,2025-07-04 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400787.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department today (July 4) said that subsequent to yesterday's announcement that kinds of prepackaged turkey bacon originated from the United States (US) might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, a follow-up investigation showed that an importer had imported one of the affected products. The CFS urged the public not to consume the product. The trade should stop using or selling the affected batch of the product immediately if they possess it.

Product details are as follows:

Product name: Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original
Place of origin: US
Pack size (Universal Product Code/Lot number) and use-by dates:
(1) 12oz (071871548601/RS40), July 18 to August 2, 2025;
(2) 36oz (071871548748/RS19, RS40 and RS42), July 23 to September 4, 2025; and
(3) 48oz (071871548793/RS19, RS40 and RS42), July 18 to September 4, 2025

  ""The CFS has been closely following up on the notice issued by United States Department of Agriculture indicating that the above-mentioned product might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes and is being recalled. Upon learning of the incident, the CFS immediately followed up on the incident, and learnt during the follow-up investigation that an importer (Etak International Limited) had imported one of the concerned products (pack size: 12oz; use-by date: July 26, 2025).""

The importer concerned has stopped sales and removed from shelves the affected product, and has initiated a recall according to the CFS's instructions. Members of the public may call its hotline at 2526 2371 during office hours for enquiries about the recall of the product concerned.

  ""Listeria monocytogenes can be easily destroyed by cooking but can survive and multiply at refrigerator temperature. Most healthy individuals do not develop symptoms or only have mild symptoms like fever, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea when infected. However, severe complications such as septicaemia, meningitis or even death may occur in newborns, the elderly and those with a weaker immune system. Although infected pregnant women may just experience mild symptoms generally, the infection of Listeria monocytogenes may cause miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, or severe infection in newborns,"" the spokesman said.

""In order to reduce the risk of listeriosis, susceptible populations such as pregnant women should consume freshly prepared hot food where possible, reheat chilled food until it is hot all the way through, and avoid high-risk foods, including ready-to-eat food such as cold cuts, cold smoked seafood, soft cheeses, salads, etc, or cook them thoroughly before consumption, even if they are presented as part of a dish.""

  The CFS will alert the trade to the incident, and will continue to follow up and take appropriate action. The investigation is ongoing."

產品名稱：Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original
來源地：美國
包裝（產品編號／批次編號）及此日期或之前食用：
（一）12安士（071871548601／RS40），二○二五年七月十八日至八月二日；
（二）36安士（071871548748／RS19、RS40和RS42），二○二五年七月二十三日至九月四日；及
（三）48安士（071871548793／RS19、RS40和RS42），二○二五年七月十八日至九月四日

中心發言人說：「中心一直密切跟進美國農業部早前發出通告，指上述產品可能受李斯特菌污染，正進行回收。中心得悉事件後，已即時跟進事件，並於跟進調查發現有進口商（意得國際有限公司）曾進口其中一款受影響產品（包裝：12安士；此日期或之前食用：二○二五年七月二十六日）。」

  有關進口商已按中心指示將該款受影響產品停售和下架，並展開回收。市民可於辦公時間致電其熱線2526 2371，查詢有關產品的回收事宜。

發言人說：「李斯特菌可在一般烹煮溫度下輕易消滅，但能在冷藏低溫下生存和繁殖。大部分身體健康的人在感染這種細菌後不會出現病徵或只出現輕微病徵如發燒、肌肉疼痛、頭痛、噁心、嘔吐及腹瀉等。但對初生嬰兒、長者和免疫力較低的人，則可能出現嚴重的併發症如敗血症及腦膜炎，甚至死亡。孕婦感染李斯特菌一般症狀輕微，但可導致胎兒流產、夭折、早產，或引致新生嬰兒患上嚴重的感染。」

「為減低感染李斯特菌病的風險，高危人士如孕婦應盡量進食剛煮好的熱食，徹底翻熱冷凍食物，並避免進食或在進食前徹底煮熟高風險食物（即食食物例如凍食肉類、冷燻的海產、軟芝士、沙律等），即使有關食物只屬於一道菜色的一部分。」

中心會就事件通知業界，並會繼續跟進事件和採取適當行動。調查仍然繼續。"
政務司副司長出席慶祝《香港國安法》實施5周年暨香港回歸祖國28周年「心繫家國」聯校國民教育活動匯演致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-07-04 19:30,2025-07-04 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400569.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（七月四日）出席慶祝《香港國安法》實施5周年暨香港回歸祖國28周年「心繫家國」聯校國民教育活動匯演的致辭：

王偉明部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部部長）、蔡若蓮局長（教育局局長）、李慧琼議員（愛國主義教育工作小組組長）、馬志民牧師（中華基督教會香港區會執行委員會主席）、李培埡主席（九龍樂善堂主席）、伍怡副主席（東華三院副主席）、譚毓楨副主席（保良局第一副主席兼教育主委）、各辦學團體及議會代表、各位嘉賓、校長、老師、家長和同學：

大家好！很高興出席今天的聯校匯演，和大家一同熱烈慶賀香港回歸祖國28周年，以及《香港國安法》實施五周年，並共同見證「心繫家國3.0」的豐碩成果。「『心繫家國』聯校國民教育活動系列」對我來說別有感覺，因為今次已是我第三年出席這個大型活動，亦足見特區政府相當重視這個系列。

香港自回歸祖國以來，在「一國兩制」的堅實保障下不斷前行。二十八年間，香港與祖國同步發展，在國家的強大支持下，積極參與粵港澳大灣區建設、「一帶一路」倡議等重大發展戰略，展現出蓬勃的發展活力與廣闊的前景。

二○一九年的黑暴事件，相信大家記憶猶新，香港其時被蹂躪得千瘡百孔，「一國兩制」危在旦夕。感謝中央政府果斷出手，在二○二○年六月三十日由全國人民代表大會常務委員會通過制定《香港國安法》，並透過納入《基本法》附件三在香港特區頒布實施。有了《香港國安法》，香港才能抵禦反中亂港分子和外部勢力的攻擊，才有愛國者治港、朗朗乾坤的好局面，讓香港從「由亂到治」走向「由治及興」。《香港國安法》的實施不但回復特區的社會安寧，更為經濟發展提供必須的安定營商環境。近期很多世界排名，都實實在在說明了《香港國安法》令香港的營商和投資環境更勝從前。這些排名包括：「全球最自由經濟體」第一、國際金融中心居世界第三、世界競爭力升至全球第三；以及港股IPO集資額超過800億港元，世界排名第一等。國際高等教育調查機構QS的最新世界大學排名中，本港更有5間大學位列全球百大，足以證明香港在《香港國安法》的保障下，能更安心、更有信心地推動教育。

在《香港國安法》實施5周年的時刻，我們更深刻體會到維護國家安全與推動愛國主義教育的重要性：因為當你愛你的國家，便會自覺、自發地維護國家安全。特區政府一直着力弘揚以愛國愛港為核心、與「一國兩制」方針相契合的主流價值觀。政府去年四月成立由政務司司長出任主席的「愛國主義教育工作小組」，目的就是加強市民對國家及中華優秀文化的認識與認同，並有系統地將愛國主義教育融入國民教育體系。今日「心繫家國3.0」聯校國民教育系列，正正是教育界仝工積極回應這政策、攜手推進愛國主義教育的典範。

「心繫家國」系列自二○二二／二三學年啓動以來，已踏入第三年。隨着多個辦學團體及學校議會的參與，活動規模不斷擴展，至今舉辦的大型聯校活動已超過50項，參與人次累計超過8萬，並透過跨校、跨界別的協作模式，成功在校園營造出濃厚的愛國氛圍。

過去一年，「心繫家國3.0」一共舉辦了28項聯校活動，內容涵蓋中華文化體驗、非遺技藝學習、視藝與創科展覽、與國家政策接軌的主題比賽及專題探究等，讓學生在親身參與中，領略中華文化的底蘊，從中培養家國情懷與民族自豪感。

今晚「心繫家國」的匯演，不僅是過去一年豐碩成果的呈現，更是學生在舞台上展現自信與才華的珍貴時刻。我們很幸運，生處在國家富強的年代，國家也特別關顧香港特區——最近的例子，莫如派遣山東艦編隊來港作全國的首次對外開放參觀。我期望同學們能將從「心繫家國」活動中所獲得的知識與體會，內化為正確的價值觀，再轉化為行動力，積極實踐愛國愛港的精神，立志成為有理想、敢擔當、富香港情懷和國家觀念的新一代，為維護國家統一與民族團結貢獻青春的激情和力量！

最後，我謹衷心感謝各個辦學團體、學校議會、教育界仝工、合作機構及社區夥伴，在推動愛國主義教育上一直不遺餘力的籌辦付出。我亦祝祖國富強昌盛、香港安定繁榮，並預祝今晚匯演圓滿成功，在座各位身心康健、學習愉快！多謝大家。"

反非法勞工行動拘七人（附圖）,2025-07-04 19:07,2025-07-04 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400695.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於六月三十日至昨日（七月三日）在全港多區展開代號「曙光行動」的反非法勞工行動，並聯同勞工處於七月二日執行打擊非法外賣員的「光影行動」。行動中合共拘捕六名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。

於「曙光行動」行動中，入境處特遣隊人員搜查了三十四個目標地點，包括裝修中單位、回收場、餐廳及零售店鋪，共拘捕四名懷疑非法勞工及一名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為兩男兩女，年齡介乎四十三至五十九歲。當中一名男子持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」），一男一女同時涉嫌行使及管有懷疑偽造身份證。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主為一名五十二歲女子。

於「光影行動」行動中，入境處及勞工處執法人員於九龍西區搜查了二十四個目標地點，共拘捕兩名懷疑非法勞工。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為兩名男子，年齡分別為三十二及三十四歲。該兩名男子均持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」

發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。根據《入境條例》第20（1）（a）條規定，如果某入境者在香港被裁定觸犯可以判處不少於兩年監禁刑罰的罪行，則行政長官可以向他發出遞解離境令，禁止該入境者在以後任何時間留在香港。根據現行法例，任何人士使用或管有偽造身份證或他人身份證乃屬違法，違者可被檢控，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款十萬元及監禁十年。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"
Seven persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operations (with photo),2025-07-04 19:07,2025-07-04 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202507/04/P2025070400633.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Twilight"" from June 30 to yesterday (July 3) and a joint operation with the Labour Department codenamed ""Lightshadow"" to combat illegal food delivery couriers, on July 2. A total of six suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested.

 During operations ""Twilight"", ImmD Task Force officers raided 34 target locations including premises under renovation, recycling yards, restaurants and retail stores. Four suspected illegal workers and one suspected employer were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men and two women, aged 43 to 59. Among them, one man was a holder of a recognisance form, which prohibits him from taking any employment. In addition, one man and one woman were suspected of using and being in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card. One woman, aged 52, was suspected of employing the illegal workers and was also arrested.

 During operation ""Lightshadow"", ImmD and Labour Department enforcement officers raided 24 target locations in Kowloon West Region. Two suspected illegal workers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised two men, aged 32 and 34. Both of them were holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment.

 An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

 The spokesman warned, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining in any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment. As stipulated in section 20(1)(a) of the Immigration Ordinance, the Chief Executive may make a deportation order against an immigrant, prohibiting the immigrant from being in Hong Kong at any time thereafter if the immigrant has been found guilty in Hong Kong of an offence punishable by imprisonment for not less than two years. Under the prevailing laws, it is an offence to use or possess a forged Hong Kong identity card or a Hong Kong identity card related to another person. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to 10 years' imprisonment.""

 The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

 According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman reminded all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

 Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter or temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."
