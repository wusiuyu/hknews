Yellow fire danger warning

The fire danger situation today (November 30) is yellow and the risk of fire is high. People are urged to prevent fires breaking out and hikers should also be vigilant."
Hong Kong mourns Tai Po fire victims as government support efforts continue,2025-11-30 01:23,2025-11-30 01:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/30/P2025113000032.htm,"  The Government mourned the victims of the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po and expressed profound condolences at the Central Government Offices yesterday morning (November 29), with national and regional flags at all government buildings flying at half-mast. Members of the public also visited condolence points in various districts to sign condolence books and mourn the victims.

  Meanwhile, multiple government departments under the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements, led respectively by the Chief Secretary for Administration, the Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, and the Deputy Financial Secretary; continue to work tirelessly, pushing forward follow-up support and relief efforts on all fronts. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government wishes to express its sincere gratitude to the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and all relevant departments of Guangdong Province for their staunch support and prompt assistance, including the provision of numerous pieces of necessary equipment to the HKSAR, such as drones, exoskeleton devices, protective gear, and medical supplies. This significantly assisted the relevant departments in their emergency response and the follow-up efforts.

  The Government has been offering an emergency cash subsidy of $10,000 per affected household to provide immediate relief for affected residents. As at 3.30pm yesterday, the Government has registered more than 1 800 households for the subsidy and disbursed the emergency cash subsidies to 929 households. In addition, the Government will provide a token of solidarity of $200,000 to the family members of each deceased victim, and a living allowance of $50,000 will be provided to each affected household starting next week.

   As of yesterday morning, social workers of the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in touch with about 1 300 households, and 3 200 affected residents have been registered for support services under the ""one social worker per household"" arrangement. The SWD will continue to engage other affected households. Residents not yet in touch with the SWD are advised to leave their contact information by calling 182 183.

  In addition, the Government will further strengthen the ""one social worker per household"" service by mobilising civil servants. For each household, in addition to one social worker, two to three civil servants will be assigned to provide voluntary support, such as running errands or collecting supplies, with the aim of delivering more comprehensive assistance.

  Regarding fundraising and relief supplies, the Government has established a Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Apart from the $300 million injection from the Government, as at 3pm yesterday, the support fund has raised around $800 million, bringing the fund’s total to around $1.1 billion. The Government will also set up a central supplies station at the Tai Po Community Centre to co-ordinate and properly manage the donated materials received. Members of the public may also provide their contact information and details of the items they wish to donate via WhatsApp at 9213 2388 for timely follow-up by the Government. In addition, the Government is working with the information technology sector to expedite the development of an online platform to facilitate registration of supplies donations from organisations and members of the public.

  In order to alleviate the financial pressure of affected owners at Wang Fuk Court, the Hong Kong Housing Authority has immediately relaxed the provisions regarding mortgage repayment periods and repayment amounts under the Deed of Guarantee. Such relaxation allows banks and financial institutions concerned to offer special mortgage arrangements to the mortgagors of subsidised sale flats with premium unpaid, including deferred repayment of mortgage instalments or principal.
  
  On emergency accommodation support for residents affected by the fire, as of this afternoon, around 517 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels/camps or hotel rooms. Another 1 038 residents have moved into transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau or the Housing Society. Furthermore, two shelters remain open for residents in need.

   To facilitate the victims staying at transitional housing units, the residents' service connecting Good House (transitional housing project in Tai Po) and MTR Tai Po Market Station commenced operation this morning, while the frequency of the residents' service plying between Trackside Villas (another transitional housing project in Tai Po) and MTR Tai Po Market Station has been strengthened since yesterday. The Transport Department has also steered public transport operators to enhance the service of franchised bus and green minibus routes travelling Ting Kok Road to accommodate the needs of affected residents admitted into Good House and Lok Sin Village (another project).

  As for the funeral-related matters, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will arrange dedicated staff to assist each family of the deceased, enabling them to make arrangements at their preferred time and location. The FEHD has set up a service counter at the Fu Shan Public Mortuary to offer assistance to families.

  Regarding mental health support, the Fire Services Department's (FSD) Psychological Services Unit is also providing emotional support and psychological counselling to the family members of the deceased fireman, as well as to other FSD members engaged in frontline firefighting and rescue, and supporting personnel. The Unit will also conduct post-operational psychological debriefings to help them process their emotions. The FSD also expresses its gratitude to the Police and the Correctional Services Department for promptly deploying their teams of clinical psychologists to assist in providing professional psychological services to FSD personnel.

  To pool strengths from the education sector in a more focused manner, the Education Bureau has initiated the establishment of a territory-wide education sector support group for special incidents, comprising education bodies of primary and secondary schools, kindergartens and special schools; school councils; and various school heads' associations. It serves as an exchange platform for keeping abreast of the situation of all schools in Hong Kong, providing affected students with more tailored assistance, and garnering and unifying support to help students and teachers overcome trauma with a view to facilitating a speedy recovery of the community.

   For the latest updates and information about the support services, please visit the Government's one-stop dedicated website: www.taipofire.gov.hk.

  Regarding the handling of alleged missing persons, the Police deployed over 600 officers of the Disaster Victim Identification Unit to conduct searches at two of the buildings yesterday. The search operation was completed at about 2.30pm yesterday, during which no human remains were found. The Police have arranged sufficient manpower to remain on standby. Once the relevant departments confirm the safety of each building, the Police will immediately deploy officers there to conduct searches. The Police will continue to follow up on the alleged missing persons, aiming to confirm their status and the number of casualties as soon as possible.

  On the investigations and monitoring fronts, the FSD conducted functional tests on the fire alarm systems (including fire alarm bells) at all eight domestic blocks of Wang Fuk Court after the fire. The department found that the fire alarm systems were not in effective working order. The FSD will continue to carry out inspections on other fire service installations and equipment in all domestic blocks of Wang Fuk Court and will collect relevant evidence. Should any person be found to have contravened the provisions of the Fire Services Ordinance, appropriate enforcement action will be taken. If any matters beyond the scope of the Fire Services Ordinance are identified, the case will be referred to the relevant law enforcement authorities for follow-up action.

  The interdepartmental Fire Investigation Task Force, led by the Fire Services Department, held its first meeting on November 28 to investigate the cause of the fire, how it spread, and to determine the factors that led to heavy casualties.

  The three personnel of the construction company who were arrested on November 27 have been released on bail. The Police have accorded top priority to the case and are conducting a thorough and in-depth investigation, gathering evidence through various channels.

   The Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau (ICU), together with professionals from the Housing Department led by two Deputy Directors and five Chief Structural Engineers at directorate level, visited Wang Fuk Court yesterday to inspect the overall structural safety of the damaged buildings. As at 1pm yesterday, the ICU has completed the inspections on the structural safety of the whole blocks of Wang Yan House and Wang Tao House as well as the first two floors of Wang Cheong Court. Based on the visual inspections of the situations on site, the ICU assessed that Wang Yan House and Wang Tao House should have no imminent danger in terms of structural safety. Preliminary observations suggested that the structure of some units may have shown more serious damages, and temporary support may be necessary. Contractors for emergency maintenance have already been mobilised to conduct relevant works.

   The ICU has continued to deploy manpower to conduct on-site sampling at Wang Fuk Court and four other Home Ownership Scheme (HOS) courts that have been issued notices under the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme, including Sui Wo Court in Sha Tin, Ching Lai Court in Sham Shui Po, Yee Kok Court in Sham Shui Po, and On Kay Court in Kwun Tong. Samples collected from different positions of the protective nets have been sent to the Government Laboratory for testing yesterday. In the four HOS courts other than Wang Fuk Court, in case any flammable material is identified on the external walls, the ICU would instruct the contractors to remove it immediately.

  The Buildings Department (BD) announced yesterday that the BD has issued orders under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) requiring the immediate temporary suspension of works on 28 private building projects with Prestige Construction & Engineering Company, Limited (PC&E) as the registered contractor, as well as two other private building maintenance projects in which plastic sheetings were found to be used. The BD has also ordered at once the two registered contractors concerned (Fulam Construction Engineering Company Limited and Yuen Fat Construction Engineering Limited) to remove the plastic sheetings, and will seek legal advice for considering legal penalties. Contractors responsible for the above-mentioned 30 projects are required to conduct independent safety audits for the projects and submit to the BD improvement plans and implement improvement measures before the department considers if and when the works can be resumed.

  Furthermore, the BD will continue its special inspection operation. As of November 29, 250 buildings undergoing external wall maintenance have been inspected and samples have been taken for testing from buildings installed with scaffold nets. If further buildings are found to be using foam or plastic sheeting to block up windows, or if sampling results indicate that the scaffold nets fail to meet fire-retardant standards, follow-up actions will be promptly announced.
  
  The Labour Department (LD) launched a territory-wide special enforcement operation since November 28, targeting the fire protection facilities and fire emergency preparedness of building maintenance work sites with large-scale scaffolding erected. This includes checking if protective screens (also known as scaffold nets) on scaffolds are in compliance with recognised standards for fire-retardant materials to ensure occupational safety of workers. As of November 29, the LD inspected 46 work sites, with a total of 39 written warnings and two improvement notices issued."
Buildings Department ordered temporary suspension of works on 30 private building projects,2025-11-30 01:15,2025-11-30 01:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/30/P2025113000022.htm,"âA spokesman for the Buildings Department (BD) said on November 29 that the BD has issued orders under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) requiring the immediate temporary suspension of works on 28 private building projects with Prestige Construction & Engineering Company, Limited (PC&E) as the registered contractor, as well as on two other private building maintenance projects in which plastic sheeting were found to be used. The BD has also ordered at once the two registered contractors concerned (Fulam Construction Engineering Company Limited and Yuen Fat Construction Engineering Limited) to remove the plastic sheeting, and will seek legal advice for considering legal penalties. Contractors responsible for the above-mentioned 30 projects are required to conduct an independent safety audit for the projects and submit to the BD an improvement plan and implement improvement measures before considering if and when the works could be resumed.

The BD's decision to temporarily suspend the works on the 28 projects managed by PC&E was due to a lack of confidence in its ability to ensure site safety. The No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po exposed serious deficiencies of PC&E in site safety management, including the extensive use of foam boards to block up windows during building repairs. Given the concerns about PC&E's capabilities and awareness on site safety, the BD has issued orders under Section 23(1)(b)(iii) of the BO to suspend the works projects with PC&E as the main contractor with immediate effect. Of these projects where PC&E is the registered contractor, 11 involve repairs of private buildings and 17 involve additions and alterations works.
â
During the special inspection operation, the BD found two building maintenance projects where windows were covered up by plastic sheeting. These included one at Fortress Garden in North Point (the registered contractor for this project is Yuen Fat Construction Engineering Limited, with PC&E as project manager) and another one at China Travel Building in Central (the registered contractor for this project is Fulam Construction Engineering Company Limited). The BD has already asked the registered contractors of the two projects to remove the plastic sheeting, and will seek legal advice for considering legal penalties. For the sake of prudence, the BD has also ordered a temporary suspension of the two projects.

Apart from issuing orders for temporary suspension, the BD has already required the relevant contractors to conduct an independent safety audit to review their safety management system. Taking cognisance of the outcome of the safety audit, the contractors are required to submit an improvement plan and implement improvement measures, with a view to demonstrating that they have an effective safety management system before the resumption of works can be considered.

The temporary suspension of works is to better safeguard the safety of both workers and users. As for the impact on the progress of the relevant projects, it will depend on whether the contractors can promptly implement a site safety plan that the BD will accept.

Furthermore, the BD will continue its special inspection operation. As of November 29, 250 buildings have been inspected and samples have been taken for testing from buildings installed with scaffold nets. If further buildings are found to be using foam or plastic sheeting to block up windows, or if sampling results indicate that the scaffold nets fail to meet fire-retardant standards, follow-up actions will be promptly announced."
全港哀悼大埔火災罹難者　政府應急支援不停歇,2025-11-29 23:25,2025-11-29 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900858.htm,"政府今日（十一月二十九日）早上在政府總部舉行悼念儀式，沉痛哀悼在大埔宏福苑火災不幸罹難的人士，全港所有政府建築物及設施的國旗及區旗下半旗誌哀，市民亦紛紛到各區的弔唁處簽署弔唁冊，留言表達對罹難者的深切悼念。

同時，分別由政務司司長、政務司副司長和財政司副司長領導的調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組下的多個部門繼續馬不停蹄，全方位推進後續支援善後工作。就此，香港特區政府亦衷心感謝中央港澳工作辦公室和廣東省各相關部門的全力支持和迅速協助，包括為香港提供許多所需裝備（例如無人機、外骨骼機械裝備、防護裝備和醫療用品等），對相關部門做好應急處置和善後工作給予大力支持。

政府已陸續向每戶受影響居民提供一萬元現金的應急補助金，以解受影響居民燃眉之急。截至今日下午三時三十分，已為超過1 800戶登記，並向929戶派發相關應急補助金。此外，政府亦會為每位死難者的家屬發放20萬元慰問金，並由下星期開始，為每一戶受影響家庭發放五萬元生活津貼。

社會福利署（社署）社工至今早已接觸約1 300戶，為3 200名受影響居民登記，以提供「一戶一社工」的跟進支援服務。社署會繼續接觸受影響住戶，並呼籲未與社署聯絡的居民，盡快致電182 183提供聯絡方法。

此外，政府亦會進一步加強「一戶一社工」服務，通過動員公務員，針對每一戶除社工外，再配備兩至三名公務員提供義務工作，例如奔走或取物資等，希望把支援服務做得更加到位。

  在募捐及物資支援方面，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」捐款，除政府的三億元外，截至今日下午三時，援助基金已籌募約八億元捐款，即整個基金的總額約為11億元。政府並將於大埔社區中心設立中央物資站，以統籌及妥善管理收到的捐贈物資。市民可透過WhatsApp號碼9213 2388提供其聯絡資料捐獻物資，以便政府適時跟進。政府亦正與資訊科技業界加快建立物資捐獻網上平台，方便團體及市民登記可捐贈物資。

為減輕宏福苑受影響業主的經濟壓力，香港房屋委員會即時放寬按揭貸款保證契據的還款期和還款額規定，允許相關財務機構為未補價單位提供特別按揭安排，如延期償還供款或本金。

就為受火災影響的居民提供應急住宿支援方面，截至今日下午，約517名居民已入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有1 038名居民入住房屋局的過渡性房屋或香港房屋協會的單位。此外，政府繼續開放兩個庇護中心，供有需要的居民使用。

為便利入住過渡性房屋單位的災民，接駁大埔「善樓」與港鐵大埔墟站的居民巴士服務今日上午起運作；接駁區內另一過渡性房屋項目「策誠軒」與港鐵大埔墟站的居民巴士服務今日起亦已加密班次。運輸署亦已督導公共運輸服務營辦商加強途經汀角路的專營巴士和專線小巴服務，支援入住「善樓」和和另一項目「樂善村」的災民。

至於殮葬事宜，食物環境衞生署（食環署）會安排專人協助每一個死難者家庭處理，並讓家屬可以按其屬意的時段及地點安排有關身後事。食環署亦已在富山公眾殮房設立服務櫃位，為家屬提供協助。

在情緒支援方面，消防處心理服務組人員已即時為殉職消防員家屬、參與前線救援及後勤支援的消防處屬員提供情緒支援與心理輔導，亦會為他們進行「行動後心理解說」，協助疏導人員的情緒。消防處亦感謝警務處及懲教署迅速調派臨床心理學家團隊，協助為消防處同事提供專業心理服務。

為更聚焦集結學界力量，教育局已發起成立「全港教育界特別事故支援小組」，涵蓋中學、小學、幼兒及特殊教育團體、學校議會、各大校長會等，創設交流平台，及時了解全港學校的情況，讓受影響同學得到更適切支援，同時凝聚力量，團結一致，攜手幫助師生走出創傷，讓社會盡快復元。

至於處理報稱失聯人士個案方面，警方今日派出逾六百名「災難遇害者辨認組」人員進入其中兩幢大廈進行搜索，並於下午約二時三十分完成。搜索期間，人員並未發現遺骸。警方已安排足夠人手候命，每當相關部門確認一幢大廈安全後，警方會立即派員進入該幢大廈進行搜索。警方亦繼續跟進報稱失聯人士個案，務求盡快確認他們的情況及死傷人數。

至於調查及規管工作方面，消防處於火警後，對宏福苑八座大廈的火警警報系統（包括火警鐘）進行功能性測試，發現該等大廈的火警警報系統未處於有效操作狀態。消防處將繼續檢測屋苑各大廈其他消防裝置及設備，並蒐集證據。如發現任何人士違反消防法例，消防處將採取執法行動。如發現涉及違反《消防條例》以外的事宜，處方會將個案轉介相關執法部門跟進。

由消防處牽頭的跨部門調查專組（調查專組）已於昨日召開首次會議，調查方向為調查火警起因及蔓延原因，以及導致大量死傷者的成因。

  警方於十一月二十七日拘捕的三名建築工程公司人士已獲准保釋候查。警方極度重視此案件，正循多方面搜證，作出全面及深入的調查。

房屋局獨立審查組聯同由房屋署兩位副署長及五位首長級總結構工程師帶領的房屋署專業人員今日到宏福苑視察受損大樓整體結構安全情況。至下午一時，審查組已完成視察全幢宏仁閣、全幢宏道閣，以及宏昌閣首兩層的樓宇整體結構安全情況。經目測視察現場情況，審查組評估宏仁閣和宏道閣樓宇整體結構沒有即時危險，初步發現小量單位結構損壞較嚴重，有需要進行臨時鞏固工程，已動員緊急維修承建商安排相關鞏固工作。

審查組派員繼續於宏福苑及另外四個已發出強制性驗樓通知的居屋屋苑（包括沙田穗禾苑、深水埗清麗苑、深水埗怡閣苑及觀塘安基苑）不同位置就棚網進行現場採樣，樣本今日內送交政府化驗所進行測試。在宏福苑以外的四個屋苑，如在採樣過程中發現外牆覆蓋有易燃保護物料，審查組會指示承辦商立即移除。

屋宇署今日公布，已根據《建築物條例》發出命令，要求由宏業建築工程有限公司作為註冊承建商的28個私人樓宇工程項目立即暫時停工。同時，署方也命令另外兩個在私人樓宇維修中使用塑料膠板的項目暫時停工，屋宇署亦已即時要求該兩個項目的註冊承建商（富林工程營造有限公司及源發建築工程有限公司）移除塑膠板，並會諮詢法律意見考慮法律懲處。負責上述30個項目的承建商要先為項目施工進行獨立安全審核，向屋宇署提交改善方案及完成落實改善措施以證明工程能安全進行，署方才會決定是否和何時容許項目復工。

此外，屋宇署正繼續特別巡查行動，截至今日已巡查250幢進行外牆維修的樓宇，並向有棚網的樓宇取樣檢驗。如發現再有樓宇使用發泡膠或塑膠板遮封窗戶，或抽查檢驗結果顯示棚網不符合阻燃標準，會盡快向外公布跟進行動。

  另外，勞工處昨日起展開全港性特別執法行動，巡查設有大型棚架的樓宇維修工程工地的防火設施及火災應變安排，當中包括檢查棚架上的保護幕（俗稱「棚網」）阻燃性認可標準，以保障工人的職業安全。截至今日，勞工處已巡查46個工地，共發出39份書面警告及兩張敦促改善通知書。"
屋宇署勒令30個私人樓宇工程項目暫時停工,2025-11-29 22:37,2025-11-29 22:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900822.htm,"屋宇署發言人今日（十一月二十九日）表示，已根據《建築物條例》發出命令，要求由宏業建築工程有限公司（宏業）作為註冊承建商的28個私人樓宇工程項目立即暫時停工。同時，署方也命令另外兩個在私人樓宇維修中使用塑料膠板的項目暫時停工，屋宇署亦已即時要求該兩個項目的註冊承建商（富林工程營造有限公司及源發建築工程有限公司）移除塑膠板，並會諮詢法律意見考慮法律懲處。負責上述30個項目的承建商要先為項目施工進行獨立安全審核，向屋宇署提交改善方案及完成落實改善措施以證明工程能安全進行，署方才會決定是否和何時容許項目復工。

針對宏業負責的28個項目作出暫時停工決定，是基於屋宇署對宏業保障工地安全的能力缺乏信心。大埔宏福苑五級火警揭示宏業在地盤安全管理有嚴重缺失，包括使用大量發泡膠板遮封維修樓宇的窗戶。由於屋宇署對宏業的地盤安全管理能力和意識存疑，因此根據《建築物條例》第23（1）（b）（iii）條向宏業發出命令，即時暫時停止由宏業作為項目主事承建商的工程，當中11項是由宏業作為註冊承建商的私人樓宇維修工程，而17項是由宏業作為註冊承建商的加建及改建工程。

此外，屋宇署在特別巡查行動中發現兩項樓宇维修工程以塑膠板遮封窗戶，包括一項位於北角的富澤花園（該項目的註冊承建商為源發建築工程有限公司，宏業以項目經理身份參與），以及一項位於中環中旅大廈的樓宇維修工程（該項目註冊承建商為富林工程營造有限公司）。屋宇署昨日（十一月二十八日）已即時要求該兩個項目的註冊承建商移除塑膠板，並會諮詢法律意見考慮法律懲處。為審慎起見，屋宇署亦命令該兩項目暫時停止工程。

屋宇署除發出暫時停工命令外，已要求上述承建商為項目進行獨立安全審核，以檢視其安全管理系統，並按安全審核結果提交改善方案及完成落實改善措施，待審視及確信其具備有效的安全管理系統，才會考慮讓承建商恢復進行工程。

暫時停工是要更好保障工人和用戶的安全。至於對工程進度的影響，則取決於承建商是否能夠盡快落實令屋宇署信納的工地安全計劃。

此外，屋宇署正繼續特別巡查行動，截至今日已巡查250幢進行外牆維修的樓宇，並向有棚網的樓宇取樣檢驗。如發現再有樓宇使用發泡膠或塑膠板遮封窗戶，或抽查檢驗結果顯示棚網不符合阻燃標準，會盡快向外公布跟進行動。"
Remarks by SHYA at media session (with photo/video),2025-11-29 21:34,2025-11-29 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900770.htm,"  The Deputy Chief Secretary for Administration, Mr Cheuk Wing-hing, together with the Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak; the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun; Police Regional Commander of New Territories North Regional Headquarters, Ms Lam Man-han; and Officer in charge of the Casualty Enquiry Unit, Chief Superintendent, Ms Tsang Shuk-yin, met the media today (November 29) regarding the follow-up work on the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po. Following are the remarks by Miss Mak and Ms Tsang at the media session:

Reporter: Firstly, I just want to clarify on the casualty figures. Can the Government provide a little bit more clarity on the casualty figures, and also whether the new missing persons cases that you mentioned earlier add to the overall tally, just some clarity on that. And the second thing is, could you also talk about the difficulties in identifying the bodies so far, what are the major issues that are facing the identification of bodies, and how long will this process take according to your estimation. Lastly, we would like to ask about the subsidy. Has Government witnessed any cases of the subsidy given to the residents being abused? Could Miss Mak clarify exactly does the subsidy only apply to home owners or does it apply to home owners who live here, or does it apply to tenants, just have a more specific clarity on that. Lastly, if there is a case of abuse, what will the Government do? Will they prosecute the home owners, for example who took the subsidy from the tenants. What is the situation then?

Officer in charge of Casualty Enquiry Unit: Regarding the number of casualties, as of 3pm today, we got 128 deceased persons confirmed. We expect that when our DVIU (Disaster Victims Identification Unit) officers enter other buildings, the number of deaths may be on the rise.

Regarding the missing person reports, as I have reported earlier, we have tried our best to call back some of the informants and also the relatives. And when we called them back, they actually have been in contact with their missing relatives or friends already. But for some other cases, the informants only provided very limited or insufficient information. For example, they could only provide the nicknames (of their friends), or they just guessed their friends might have been living there. So some of the information is really insufficient for us to proceed. But we are still reconnecting with these informants and trying to get more information.

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government understands the feelings of those residents concerned. They will be feeling helpless and unsecured. They need timely support and that is why we provide the $10,000 cash subsidy. We hope that with this cash subsidy, the households living in Wang Fuk Court can get some timely assistance. This subsidy is for those affected residents, households, living in the Court during the mega fire. No matter the tenants or the owners, who are living in the Court during this incident, are eligible for this cash subsidy. So far, we have not received any formal report about any abuse cases. If there are any cases, we will definitely look into the cases. What we want to do is to provide timely and flexible subsidies and assistance to those in need. I also urge all those residents living in Wang Fuk Court to approach us as soon as possible to get assistance and help from us. Thank you.

(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)"

And when we called them back, they actually have been in contact with their missing relatives or friends already. But for some other cases, the informants only provided very limited or insufficient information. For example, they could only provide the nicknames (of their friends), or they just guessed their friends might have been living there. So some of the information is really insufficient for us to proceed. But we are still reconnecting with these informants and trying to get more information.

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government understands the feelings of those residents concerned. They will be feeling helpless and unsecured. They need timely support and that is why we provide the $10,000 cash subsidy. We hope that with this cash subsidy, the households living in Wang Fuk Court can get some timely assistance. This subsidy is for those affected residents, households, living in the Court during the mega fire. No matter the tenants or the owners, who are living in the Court during this incident, are eligible for this cash subsidy. So far, we have not received any formal report about any abuse cases. If there are any cases, we will definitely look into the cases. What we want to do is to provide timely and flexible subsidies and assistance to those in need. I also urge all those residents living in Wang Fuk Court to approach us as soon as possible to get assistance and help from us. Thank you.

​政務司副司長就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒答問內容（附圖／短片）,2025-11-29 20:13,2025-11-29 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900730.htm,"政務司副司長卓永興今日（十一月二十九日）聯同民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟、勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡、警務處新界北總區指揮官林敏嫻及警務處傷亡查詢中心主管曾淑賢總警司就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的答問內容：

記者：現在調查進展是怎樣呢？會不會有更多人被捕？進入那兩幢搜查證據的大廈內找到甚麼？另外波及比較少的大廈，有沒有一個時間或何時可以讓居民回去呢？因為入面可能有些動物，有些居民都希望可以進入大廈。

新界北總區指揮官: 根據警方的調查進度，正如我剛才所說，入內搜證遇到相當的困難，大家都知道範圍非常之大，我們必須要做完搜證工作，作出調查，才能有一個較為確切的評估。現時我們是全方位、多方面、多角度作出調查，現場搜證工作只是我們部分工作，後面我們亦要作出其他方面的調查。在搜證完成，再加上我們背後的一些調查工作之後，如果有確實的進展，我們會聯絡大家。有關在現場搜到甚麼，今天主要都是「災難遇害者辨認組」的同事入內，看看還有沒有一些人類遺體，主要是這些。（大廈）裏面其他搜證的工作是由其他隊伍陸續上去進行的，今日主要都是做尋找死者或者遺體的工作。你可以看到，我們今天是用半日或大半日的時間完成兩幢（大廈），我們希望其餘的樓層或樓宇都能夠迅速地完成。昨日署理處長也說了，我們可能要三、四個星期才完成，但這是我們的評估。我們希望能夠盡快完成我們的調查工作，盡快考慮會否可以解封給市民。

記者：你好，想問警方何時能夠完成搜索全部大廈？會否可以加快進度？有多少人還未登記拿一萬元的應急錢及未向「一戶一社工」登記？政府如何接觸其他沒有拿到錢的災民？特別很多都是老人家。另外想問卓副司長，由你當組長的工作組現時做了甚麼工作？會如何使用市民和機構的捐款？何時可以真正將錢交到災民手上？現時成立的三個工作組都沒有時間表，何時可以有一個交代給遇難者？

政務司副司長：我先回答最後一個問題。由於我們的工作組（做緊急支援的）性質，所以現在向大家匯報工作進度，另外兩個組的工作亦在密切進行，例如另一組是有關住宿，剛才麥局長（民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟）亦已經講述，有好幾百個受影響家庭已經使用我們提供的住宿設施。至於我的工作組為緊急支援及募捐工作組，剛才麥局長已講述募捐情況，到今天為止支援基金有大概11億元。至於其他工作，例如派發慰問金和應急補助金，還有大家都看到，我們找到地鐵公司為每一名受影響居民，而非每個家庭，提供二千元儲值額的八達通，方便他們出行辦事。我們亦細化了孫局長（勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡）的「一戶一社工」工作安排，剛才孫局長亦說過，我們會有加強版，除了社工外，會有兩至三個公務員特別支援每一個家庭。每一個家庭，除了社工，還有兩至三個公務員提供支援服務。另外，麥局長正在進行構建物資捐贈的網上平台。

我們與食物環境衞生署（食環署）同事跟進提供殮葬方面的支援要怎樣做？當中牽涉認領遺體，需要取得相關文件，還有安排火化服務。政府的骨灰龕位原本需要收費，這些服務（現在）全部均免費，我們亦仔細分好崗位，例如認領遺體由哪個部門主要負責，認領遺體之後，接下來在殯葬方面，就主要由食環署負責。我們昨天亦有公布，政府會承擔殯葬費用，我們會向每個家庭提供五萬元的金額，資助殯葬方面的開支。緊急支援及募捐工作組大概的工作就是這樣。

新界北總區指揮官：關於調查進度，剛才說過一些，這搜索的過程，我們預計需要三至四星期。今日的進度，由於那兩幢大廈較遲起火，火亦較早熄滅，相對簡單些，所以我們用了大半日的時間，就已經完成這兩幢大廈的搜查工作，希望能大大縮短我們所預計三至四星期的時間。但至現時為止，因為比較早起火的宏昌閣和宏泰閣都是未搜索的，所以暫時來說，我們都是比較保守，大約三至四個星期可以完成我們的搜查工作，謝謝。

記者：請問圍網方面，警方說符合安全標準，可否有證據提供？

新界北總區指揮官：就着圍網，昨天局長說是合規的，警方亦會在這方面作出調查，我們現時沒有特別補充，謝謝。

記者：局長，為甚麼要趕走義工？為甚麼要關愛隊駐場？

民政及青年事務局局長：我希望大家明白。在事故發生後，民政處（民政事務處）有責任為受影響的居民提供一個即時的地方休息。所以在各區有事故發生時，我們一定會馬上開設庇護中心。在庇護中心內的使用者，他們都是在這次事件中受火災影響的居民。他們已經承受了這麼大的衝擊，家裏有這麼大的轉變。作為民政處，我們一定有責任保護他們的安全和私隱，也要確保每一個庇護中心的秩序、安全和衞生。

正如我昨天也說過，我們在一些庇護中心內已經有一些零星的個案，有些使用者身體不適，我們也安排他們去看醫生。我們有責任要確保庇護中心是有秩序，以保護每一個在庇護中心的使用者。我很感謝社會各界，在這段時間大家都希望出一分力，去幫助每一個住戶以及受影響的居民。我也知道大家可能會不斷送贈物資。正如剛才司長也說了，現在有很多物資送過來，但其實我們現在最需要的，是幫助安置庇護中心使用者到酒店，或者青年宿舍，給他們一個合適的地方，讓他們好好休息。為了確保受影響居民能夠得到良好的休息，我們會安排臨時住宿給他們。這些費用我們全部都不會收取的，無論是交通費，或者住宿費。

另外，在庇護中心內，我們很希望大家都可以尊重使用者的安全和私隱。不過在網上都有很多流傳，甚至一些謠言，說中心、來協助的民政處同事，或關愛隊，對其他使用者不禮貌。我們查證過，正如我今早已經在另一個場合提及，我們是沒有人報警，沒有人報過警，警方也證實了他們沒有收到任何報案紀錄。希望大家不要輕信。在這個時候，大家應該要團結一致，去幫助那些受影響的居民。我們都明白，大家有一份心意去幫助他們，所以我們正在盡快構建一個網上平台。如果大家在網上平台使用之前，可WhatsApp給我們 9213 2388，讓我們可以有序地去安排物資給居民。我希望大家明白，在這次事故受影響的居民，其實他們現在都是承受着很大的壓力。希望我們能夠盡快幫助到他們，讓他們可以到酒店，或者青年宿舍休息。因為他們之後還有很多事情要面對。當然，政府一定會提供一切適切的支援。我要再次感謝社會各界和我們一起努力，幫助市民。

政務司副司長就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2025-11-29 19:36,2025-11-29 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900711.htm,"政務司副司長卓永興今日（十一月二十九日）聯同民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟、勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡、警務處新界北總區指揮官林敏嫻及警務處傷亡查詢中心主管曾淑賢總警司就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的開場發言：

政務司副司長：各位記者朋友，就大埔宏福苑大火，我會講講緊急支援及募捐工作組幾方面的工作，以及警方遺體辨認的工作。

這場大火發生後，很多熱心市民捐贈物資到災場，並在災場派發。我們很多謝市民的捐贈。現時我們收到的物資相當大量且充足。我們建議市民已經可以暫停作這方面的捐獻，以免造成浪費。

為了統整所收到的物資，我們已經在大埔社區中心設立中央物資站，團體和市民如果仍然有意願作出物資捐贈，可以先透過WhatsApp號碼：9213 2388登記他們的資料和可捐獻的物資，以便我們整合這些資源。最後，當所需要的物資送到中央物資站，我們會妥善管理及按實際情況作物資分配。

此外，政府會在大埔社區中心設立服務中心，中心會由公務員管理及提供支援服務，包括查詢及登記接受「一戶一社工」服務，申請應急補助金、慰問金、生活津貼等。另外，我們會在仍然運作的兩個臨時庇護中心加強公務員的支援服務，以更好協助有需要的居民。

以下我交給孫玉菡局長和麥美娟局長講述他們的工作，之後警務處新界北總區指揮官林敏嫻和她的同事會講述死傷情況和遺體辨認的工作。

勞工及福利局局長：各位傳媒朋友，我想更新關於「一戶一社工」的登記狀況，截至現時我們已接觸超過1 300戶，牽涉人數逾3 200人，數字預計會持續增加。自從昨天黃昏我們呼籲居民如果不在臨時庇護中心，或者未跟我們接觸的居民，請他們致電182 183熱線，透過熱線我們已收到很多留言，方便我們去接觸他們，預期這兩天會有更多的戶數，我們陸陸續續盡可能全數為他們登記「一戶一社工」。

除此之外，政府也想再進一步加強「一戶一社工」服務，大家理解「一戶一社工」的最大目的，是方便居民處理和申請一些應急援助和服務安排，為他們提供便利。在此基礎上，政府會動員公務員，針對每一戶除社工外，再配備兩至三名公務員提供義務工作，例如奔走或取物資等，盡量令居民不用自己奔波，通過社工的協調，加上每戶配備兩至三名公務員，希望把支援服務做得更加到位。

民政及青年事務局局長：我更新一下幾項數字，包括一萬元應急錢的發放情況。截至昨晚，即十一月二十八日晚，已有1 290多戶向我們登記領取應急錢。至今日下午三時三十分，我們已向929戶派發一萬元應急錢，今早也陸續有收到登記表。除了向900多戶派發應急錢，我們正陸續聯絡居民，因為有些居民留了電話，但我們還未能聯絡上他們，也有一些居民目前是住在另外一區，我們現正想方法，可能透過其他區的民政事務處將現金交給他們。我們希望在這兩天可以完成這方面的工作，盡快將這一萬元應急錢交予受影響的住戶。

另外，關於支援基金（「大埔宏福苑援助基金」），多謝各位響應和支持。截至今日下午三時，基金已收到外界捐款八億元，連同政府的撥款三億元，這個基金已有11億元。這11億元我們會首先支援和資助有需要的住戶，另一方面更會用在長期工作上，協助受影響居民重建家園，所以這是一個長期和持續的支援。

安置方面，至今日中午，庇護中心內已有481個使用者接受安排，到酒店或青年宿舍，或是過渡屋暫住；另外也有601人去入住過渡屋。我們希望這兩天盡量為在庇護中心內逗留的市民，安排到適當的酒店或青年宿舍，或是啟德的青年驛站，又或是過渡屋，希望他們能夠有較好的空間好好休息。

另外，網上有人提出，究竟領取應急錢的資格是業主還是租戶等問題。我要講清楚，應急錢是用於幫助那些在今次火警中逃生後，沒有金錢旁身的人，所以一定是住在宏福苑的住戶，因此租戶是可以拿到應急錢的。而我們下個星期準備會發放的五萬元生活津貼，也是為受到火災影響的市民去解決生活需要，所以租戶是可以申請五萬元的生活津貼，請他們盡快去聯絡社工登記。

如果有人說，為甚麼好像有人登記了（領取應急錢）等問題。首先，我們一定會令每一個宏福苑的住戶得到應急錢和生活津貼。如果有個別的重複個案，我們會個別處理。如果有人虛報或者是特意瞞騙，他們在申請的時候需要簽收應急錢，簽收即代表他作實了符合資格，如果有虛報的話，我們會交予有關部門去處理。但無論如何，我們一定要說，無論我們提供應急錢或是生活津貼，我們都希望能夠做到快捷、簡單和有彈性的，令有需要的住戶可以及早得到支援。

警務處新界北總區指揮官：大家好，昨日在消防人員撲滅火災的工作後，警方隨即接手現場，全力進行調查及善後工作。我們現正陸續進入每一幢大廈進行搜索遺骸和蒐集證據，希望能了解事件的成因。

今日警方動員超過600名「災難遇害者辨認組」俗稱DVIU（Disaster Victims Identification Unit）的人員。DVIU於本星期四，即十一月二十七日已經開始候命，昨日滅火後，一些主管人員和部分其他人員在現場進行初步勘察和評估。今日早上，DVIU同事已進入兩幢大廈，這兩幢大廈是較遲起火，亦是較早熄滅火種的樓宇，分別是A座宏仁閣和B座宏道閣。因為這兩幢大廈的溫度已大幅下降，而相關部門確定它們的樓宇結構安全後，警方派出DVIU，他們配備頭盔、防護衣和防滑鞋這些安全裝備，陸續進入這兩幢大廈進行搜索。至今日下午二時三十分，這兩幢大廈的搜索工作已經完成。搜索期間，我們並沒有發現任何遺骸，我們在宏仁閣救出三隻貓，以及在宏道閣救出一隻烏龜，這些動物已交由香港愛護動物協會處理。

火災後，大廈內的環境是非常複雜和昏暗，很多單位都是嚴重燒毀，亦有積水，水深至小腿，很多物品倒塌，導致我們的搜查空間非常狹窄，大大增加了我們搜索的難度。正如昨日我們署理處長所指，我們已經安排足夠人手隨時候命，進入這些大廈逐家逐戶進行搜索，在確認（大廈）安全之後，我們會陸續搜索其他大廈。如有進一步消息，警方會通知大家，謝謝。

警務處傷亡查詢中心主管：在火警發生當晚，即十一月二十六日約下午六時，警方已成立傷亡查詢組，並開設共10條熱線，電話號碼是1878999，供市民查詢因今次火警而失聯的親友的情況。截至今日下午三時，今次事件共有128名市民死亡，83名傷者。

警方傷亡查詢組在接獲求助個案後，展開了多方面的排查工作，並結合現場搜救人員取得的死傷者資料後，我們已確認84名死者和37名傷者是被報失聯人士。另外，有44名死者有待遺體辨認，就此，警方正陸續通知家人和報案人，以進行遺體初步辨認程序。而在報稱失聯人士中，我們亦成功聯絡144人，他們是安全的。到目前為止，我們仍有大約150名市民未能取得聯絡。

不過，我想補充一下，在這150個個案中有約100個個案，我們收到的資料較零碎，包括報案人致電熱線時可能不清楚他懷疑失蹤的朋友是否真的居住在宏福苑，又或是他們已多年無聯絡，又或他只知道他懷疑失蹤的朋友的一些暱稱，所以我們現正逐一聯絡這些曾致電熱線的市民，希望取得更多的資料，讓我們可以推進調查進程。警方將繼續全力以赴，務求盡早知道死傷人數和報稱失聯人士的情況。"

此外，政府會在大埔社區中心設立服務中心，中心會由公務員管理及提供支援服務，包括查詢及登記接受「一戶一社工」服務，申請應急補助金、慰問金、生活津貼等。另外，我們會在仍然運作的兩個臨時庇護中心加強公務員的支援服務，以更好協助有需要的居民。

以下我交給孫玉菡局長和麥美娟局長講述他們的工作，之後警務處新界北總區指揮官林敏嫻和她的同事會講述死傷情況和遺體辨認的工作。

勞工及福利局局長：各位傳媒朋友，我想更新關於「一戶一社工」的登記狀況，截至現時我們已接觸超過1 300戶，牽涉人數逾3 200人，數字預計會持續增加。自從昨天黃昏我們呼籲居民如果不在臨時庇護中心，或者未跟我們接觸的居民，請他們致電182 183熱線，透過熱線我們已收到很多留言，方便我們去接觸他們，預期這兩天會有更多的戶數，我們陸陸續續盡可能全數為他們登記「一戶一社工」。

民政及青年事務局局長：我更新一下幾項數字，包括一萬元應急錢的發放情況。截至昨晚，即十一月二十八日晚，已有1 290多戶向我們登記領取應急錢。至今日下午三時三十分，我們已向929戶派發一萬元應急錢，今早也陸續有收到登記表。除了向900多戶派發應急錢，我們正陸續聯絡居民，因為有些居民留了電話，但我們還未能聯絡上他們，也有一些居民目前是住在另外一區，我們現正想方法，可能透過其他區的民政事務處將現金交給他們。我們希望在這兩天可以完成這方面的工作，盡快將這一萬元應急錢交予受影響的住戶。

另外，關於支援基金（「大埔宏福苑援助基金」），多謝各位響應和支持。截至今日下午三時，基金已收到外界捐款八億元，連同政府的撥款三億元，這個基金已有11億元。這11億元我們會首先支援和資助有需要的住戶，另一方面更會用在長期工作上，協助受影響居民重建家園，所以這是一個長期和持續的支援。

安置方面，至今日中午，庇護中心內已有481個使用者接受安排，到酒店或青年宿舍，或是過渡屋暫住；另外也有601人去入住過渡屋。我們希望這兩天盡量為在庇護中心內逗留的市民，安排到適當的酒店或青年宿舍，或是啟德的青年驛站，又或是過渡屋，希望他們能夠有較好的空間好好休息。

另外，網上有人提出，究竟領取應急錢的資格是業主還是租戶等問題。我要講清楚，應急錢是用於幫助那些在今次火警中逃生後，沒有金錢旁身的人，所以一定是住在宏福苑的住戶，因此租戶是可以拿到應急錢的。而我們下個星期準備會發放的五萬元生活津貼，也是為受到火災影響的市民去解決生活需要，所以租戶是可以申請五萬元的生活津貼，請他們盡快去聯絡社工登記。

如果有人說，為甚麼好像有人登記了（領取應急錢）等問題。首先，我們一定會令每一個宏福苑的住戶得到應急錢和生活津貼。如果有個別的重複個案，我們會個別處理。如果有人虛報或者是特意瞞騙，他們在申請的時候需要簽收應急錢，簽收即代表他作實了符合資格，如果有虛報的話，我們會交予有關部門去處理。但無論如何，我們一定要說，無論我們提供應急錢或是生活津貼，我們都希望能夠做到快捷、簡單和有彈性的，令有需要的住戶可以及早得到支援。

警務處新界北總區指揮官：大家好，昨日在消防人員撲滅火災的工作後，警方隨即接手現場，全力進行調查及善後工作。我們現正陸續進入每一幢大廈進行搜索遺骸和蒐集證據，希望能了解事件的成因。

今日警方動員超過600名「災難遇害者辨認組」俗稱DVIU（Disaster Victims Identification Unit）的人員。DVIU於本星期四，即十一月二十七日已經開始候命，昨日滅火後，一些主管人員和部分其他人員在現場進行初步勘察和評估。今日早上，DVIU同事已進入兩幢大廈，這兩幢大廈是較遲起火，亦是較早熄滅火種的樓宇，分別是A座宏仁閣和B座宏道閣。因為這兩幢大廈的溫度已大幅下降，而相關部門確定它們的樓宇結構安全後，警方派出DVIU，他們配備頭盔、防護衣和防滑鞋這些安全裝備，陸續進入這兩幢大廈進行搜索。至今日下午二時三十分，這兩幢大廈的搜索工作已經完成。搜索期間，我們並沒有發現任何遺骸，我們在宏仁閣救出三隻貓，以及在宏道閣救出一隻烏龜，這些動物已交由香港愛護動物協會處理。

火災後，大廈內的環境是非常複雜和昏暗，很多單位都是嚴重燒毀，亦有積水，水深至小腿，很多物品倒塌，導致我們的搜查空間非常狹窄，大大增加了我們搜索的難度。正如昨日我們署理處長所指，我們已經安排足夠人手隨時候命，進入這些大廈逐家逐戶進行搜索，在確認（大廈）安全之後，我們會陸續搜索其他大廈。如有進一步消息，警方會通知大家，謝謝。

警務處傷亡查詢中心主管：在火警發生當晚，即十一月二十六日約下午六時，警方已成立傷亡查詢組，並開設共10條熱線，電話號碼是1878999，供市民查詢因今次火警而失聯的親友的情況。截至今日下午三時，今次事件共有128名市民死亡，83名傷者。

警方傷亡查詢組在接獲求助個案後，展開了多方面的排查工作，並結合現場搜救人員取得的死傷者資料後，我們已確認84名死者和37名傷者是被報失聯人士。另外，有44名死者有待遺體辨認，就此，警方正陸續通知家人和報案人，以進行遺體初步辨認程序。而在報稱失聯人士中，我們亦成功聯絡144人，他們是安全的。到目前為止，我們仍有大約150名市民未能取得聯絡。

不過，我想補充一下，在這150個個案中有約100個個案，我們收到的資料較零碎，包括報案人致電熱線時可能不清楚他懷疑失蹤的朋友是否真的居住在宏福苑，又或是他們已多年無聯絡，又或他只知道他懷疑失蹤的朋友的一些暱稱，所以我們現正逐一聯絡這些曾致電熱線的市民，希望取得更多的資料，讓我們可以推進調查進程。警方將繼續全力以赴，務求盡早知道死傷人數和報稱失聯人士的情況。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-11-29 18:30,2025-11-29 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900651.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (November 29), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
--------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 73 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, six were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

For the recent imported and local cases residing in Tsing Yi, the CHP initiated immediate epidemiological investigations upon notification and notified the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) of the patients' activity locations for mosquito control operations. As some confirmed cases have reportedly been bitten by mosquitoes while hiking along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails, the CHP considers the trails to be a higher-risk area. As a precautionary measure, the CHP urged individuals who have recently been in the vicinity of Tsing Yi North or hiking in the Tsing Yi Nature Trails since November 23 to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the CHP's enquiry hotline (2125 2373). The hotline operates daily from 9am to 8pm. The CHP received enquiries from two individuals with mild symptoms and has arranged blood tests for them. Both blood samples tested negative for the chikungunya virus. The CHP has also informed approximately 130 primary care doctors in Kwai Tsing District through the Primary Healthcare Commission, urging them to closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing. In view of the strengthened mosquito-borne disease control measures already implemented by the relevant government departments for all imported cases, and active case tracing was conducted in the district, the occurrence of two local cases in Tsing Yi recently have no substantial impacts on the current overall risk assessment.

The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-11-29 17:30,2025-11-29 18:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900605.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十一月二十九日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年累計錄得73宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，六宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府全方位跟進
———————

就近日在青衣居住的輸入及本地個案，中心在接獲通報後已即時進行流行病學調查及把他們的活動地點通知食物環境衞生署（食環署），以進行控蚊滅蚊行動。鑑於部分確診個案報稱曾在青衣自然徑行山期間被蚊叮咬，中心評估該徑風險較高。為審慎起見，中心自十一月二十三日起呼籲近日曾在青衣北一帶活動或在青衣自然徑行山的人士，若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電中心早前設立的查詢熱線2125 2373。熱線每日上午九時至下午八時運作。中心接獲兩名有輕微病徵的人士致電查詢，並已安排他們進行抽血檢查，兩人的樣本均對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。中心本周亦已透過基層醫療署通知葵青區內約130名基層醫療醫生，呼籲他們留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。中心的流行病學調查仍然繼續。政府各相關部門已經針對所有輸入個案加強蚊媒防控措施，以及在當區進行個案主動追蹤工作，因此近日青衣的兩宗本地個案對現時整體的風險評估沒有太大影響。

此外，食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

Remarks by SHYA and SLW at media session regarding follow-up work on No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po,2025-11-29 13:40,2025-11-29 13:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900394.htm,"  The Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs, Miss Alice Mak, and the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, met the media today (November 29) regarding the follow-up work on the No. 5 alarm fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, after attending a radio programme. Following are their remarks at the media session:

Reporter: Miss Mak, you earlier mentioned that the Government is planning to roll out an e-platform for people who are willing to donate supplies to those in need to register on the platform. Could you tell us maybe how soon the public can expect the platform to be set up? Would the Government consider adding more services? Given that we can see a lot of volunteers at Tai Po, apart from offering supplies, some of them are offering like counselling services.

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: Definitely, the e-platform is going to be launched in these few days, the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry has talked to me that the platform can be rolled out in these few days. Before the rolling out of the platform, the public can reach us through our WhatsApp hotline, 9213 2388. If anybody wants to offer voluntary services or resources that can be offered to our residents, please do register through this Whatsapp platform. Moreover, the Information Services Department has already launched a website for this incident, the website address is www.taipofire.gov.hk. We have provided all the relevant information, including government hotlines and services available by the NGOs. The public can find the appropriate information through this website, thank you.

Reporter: Mr Sun, you earlier mentioned that a notice was issued last week on the fire prevention because there are reports saying that workers were seen smoking at the site. In your point of view, what can the Government do more to ensure that, contractors in similar cases really take action to avoid violating rules and regulations or even possibly leading to incidents like this? Also, we know that a number of domestic helpers were still missing in the incident and many of the Filipinos or Indonesians are still looking for them. Will the Government help them, and does the Government have any idea on how to assist these people?

Secretary for Labour and Welfare: Thank you. Since July last year, the Labour Department (LD) has conducted six rounds of inspections to the Wang Fuk Court site. Over the 16 inspections, the LD has issued six improvement notices and also carried out three prosecutions, mainly concerning safety of workers. The major concern at that time was the safety of working at height. This is the major concern. During the inspections, the LD has also issued written warning to the contractors over the importance of fire safety. The last inspection was conducted on November 20. At that inspection, the LD also issued a written warning to the contractor, reminding it of the importance of fire safety. It is because one of the complaints received was about smoking of workers at the site. The LD have taken a precautionary measure of warning the contractors.

As for the foreign domestic helpers, the LD is also working together with the two Consulates in Hong Kong. That includes a visit on-site to Tai Po so that they could look for, and also help the foreign domestic helpers on site. We are receiving more information from the two Consulates, including confirmed death of at least two Indonesian foreign domestic helpers and also a number of them are still missing. I have to thank the foreign domestic helpers at Wang Fuk Court. We understand many of them took care of elderly people and children at the Court. We know, many of them stayed inside together with their employers, taking care of them even at the height of the fire. You can be rest assured, we will provide all the necessary assistance to all the foreign domestic workers and make sure their stay in Hong Kong is safe, and to cater to their needs.

Reporter: How would the condolence money be distributed to domestic helpers?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: The Government will offer $200,000 condolence donation to those families with deceased. Social workers from the Social Welfare Department will contact these families and facilitate the distribution of the money.

民政及青年事務局局長和勞工及福利局局長會見傳媒答問內容,2025-11-29 13:38,2025-11-29 13:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202511/29/P2025112900386.htm,"民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十一月二十九日）出席電台節目後就大埔宏福苑五級火警跟進工作會見傳媒。以下是他們的答問內容：

記者：有消息指關愛隊報警要求義工離開現場，由他們接手。可否說說有沒有這件事？

民政及青年事務局局長：民政處（民政事務處）有責任協助所有受影響的居民，提供安置服務，所以我們開放臨時庇護中心。這些臨時庇護中心一向是由民政處負責管理，因為要確保中心內的秩序，保護每一個中心使用者的安全和私隱。最近某些中心已經有零星個案，有使用者身體不適，需要安排醫療服務，所以中心內的秩序、衞生，以及能確保每一位中心使用者的安全和私隱，是我們要盡的責任。

至於網上流傳稱有報警或是其他情況，其實警方已經作出澄清。首先，我們沒有人報警，警方亦沒有收到有人報案。希望大家認清事實，一起團結一致，不分彼此，為受影響的居民提供適切的服務。大家要將心比己想想，受影響居民的家園經過這麼大改變，他們要到庇護中心暫住，大家是否都希望給他們一個比較好的環境，私隱度高一點和安全的環境，讓他們可以在那裏休息呢？所以我們所做的一切都是希望讓受影響居民，可以在庇護中心有一個地方稍作休息。

現在我們最迫切要做的，是希望可以安排他們到酒店或青年宿舍，讓他們有更好的環境休息，因為他們現在無論在心理上或精神上都承受很大壓力，當然在物資和支援上我們都會繼續提供協助。

記者：想請問就事件中有外籍家庭傭工（外傭）離世，接下來政府會如何協助他們和其家屬？之後有否陸續收到其他外傭的求助？

勞工及福利局局長：有關在宏福苑工作的外傭，勞工處已聯同兩個領事館──印尼駐港領事館及菲律賓駐港領事館，進行了一次現場視察，亦已通過兩個領事館聯合提供必要的協助。我們理解，最少有兩名印尼籍外傭證實在今次的大火中不幸身故。另外，有幾名外傭的下落尚在尋找當中，他們都有「登記簿」，若他們登記的居住地址是在宏福苑，兩個領事館都會嘗試聯絡他們，現時有一部分還未聯絡到。就外傭而言，如果是不幸身故，現在的標準僱傭合約已有相關安排。香港有三十多萬名外傭，一年之中都有些不幸身故，一直都可以通過我們的標準合約作安排，包括將他們的遺體運回其家鄉，以及經外傭的保險安排適當的賠償，這個大家可以放心，我們可以循現有的辦法處理得到。另外，我們亦會特事特辦，外傭是有個指定居所並需要住在其報稱的僱主居所。自宏福苑火警後，他們固然沒辦法繼續入住該居所。因此，我們會在這方面特事特辦，為他們安排好，確保他們在香港這段期間不會違反任何有關外傭逗留條件的要求。

民政及青年事務局局長：想補充一點，剛才提及的外傭問題，政府會為每一個不幸過世死者的家屬提供20萬元的慰問金，不幸過世的外傭的家屬都可以領取20萬元慰問金。

至於網上平台，首先我要再次感謝大家都很關心宏福苑受影響的居民，所以大家都有很多物資，或者有一些學會提供一些專業的服務。為了讓居民更好、更方便，在適當的時候得到適當的物資，我們希望大家可以通知我們，向我們登記，讓我們能做配對，尤其是現在我們的物資在庇護中心已經足夠了。反而可能稍後，當我們安排了居民到長期的居所，那些長期的居所包括我們找到一千八百個單位，來自過渡性房屋和房協（香港房屋協會）的專用屋邨，屆時可能需要為他們添置一些家居設施，我們便需要再有其他物資，所以希望大家屆時可以幫忙。

我們希望大家可以在平台登記。現在，創新科技及工業局和一些創科界的朋友正在為我們製作這個平台。我相信這一兩天便可以完成。這個平台設立之前，大家也可以透過一個WhatsApp電話登記，就是9213 2388。大家可以在WhatsApp登記你的資料，或者你可以提供的物資；又或者如果你是一個專業組織，你可以提供一些義工服務，你可以登記，讓我們知道有甚麼朋友能幫忙。如果你是專業學會，想為居民提供一些情緒上的支援，你們有熱線，便可以把這些資料給我們。

政府新聞處也成立了一個網站，就是大埔宏福苑支援服務的專題網站，英文網址是www.taipofire.gov.hk。網站列出了所有政府的查詢熱線，還有專業組織提供的服務熱線，希望我們可以好好安排，令受影響的居民能夠有序地得到物資支援，資金上的支援，甚至是服務上的支援。
