Speech by FS at Biotechnology Investment Forum of BIOHK2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-11 12:03,2025-09-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100350.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Biotechnology Investment Forum of BIOHK2025 today (September 11):

Albert (Chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization and President of BIOHK2025, Professor Albert Yu), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the opening of the Biotechnology Investment Forum, here on Day 2 of BIOHK 2025. A warm welcome to all participants joining us from Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and around the world.

This Forum brings together a global community of pioneers, including scientists, entrepreneurs, investors and policymakers, who are leading the way in biotech development. It offers a valuable platform to exchange insights, foster collaboration, and explore opportunities to drive the next wave of growth in this rapidly evolving sector.

We meet at a time of rapid advancement in biotechnology, especially as it converges with artificial intelligence. Yet alongside advances and breakthroughs, the sector is grappling with a number of critical issues. How can we accelerate R&D (research and development) efficiency and clinical translation? How do we strengthen supply chain resilience and overcome technological barriers? How can we ensure access and inclusivity in biomedicine? And how do we equip biomed talent in an AI-driven world?

At the same time, the rise of China as a biotechnology leader is reshaping the global innovation landscape. The Mainland is now the world's second-largest biopharmaceutical market. Its biotech enterprises account for nearly 30 per cent of global innovative drug assets, up from just 10 per cent in 2019. This remarkable shift reflects not only our country's growing capability and capacity, but also its long-term strategic commitment and sustained investment in the sector.

In this context, there is no better place than Hong Kong to host this important discussion. Our city welcomes ideas, talent and capital from around the world. We serve as a gateway to the fast-expanding Mainland market, and as a launch pad for Mainland innovations to go global.

Indeed, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong enjoys the best of both worlds. We uphold the rule of law and continue to practise the common law system. With the free flow of capital, information and talent, Hong Kong remains deeply connected to the international community. Our intellectual property protections align with the best international standards, and our financial institutions and professional services are world-class. These qualities make Hong Kong a reliable and trusted partner for technology development and investment.

More specifically, allow me to highlight four key areas where Hong Kong can make a difference for global biotech development.

A dynamic I&T ecosystem

First, our innovation and technology (I&T) ecosystem is growing in depth and breadth. It supports the full biotech value chain, from upstream research and product design to downstream commercialisation and market expansion.

At the upstream level, Hong Kong's universities are world leading. Five of them rank among the world’s top 100, with two medical schools among the global top 25. We have also established 14 dedicated healthcare research centres led by eminent academic and clinical researchers. Their work spans genomics, regenerative medicine, organoid models, cell therapy and beyond.

In the midstream, we are stepping up efforts to translate research into real-world applications. Government schemes such as the RAISe+ Programme are helping to bridge the gap between laboratories and market, facilitating the growth of new biotech ventures.

Downstream, we are nurturing targeted industries where Hong Kong holds strategic advantages, in particular biotech and AI. Today, Hong Kong is home to over 4 700 start-ups and nearly 20 unicorns, many of which are nurtured and supported by the Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport. 

We continue to attract strategic enterprises from around the world. Over the past two years, more than 80 such enterprises have established a presence in Hong Kong, investing over US$6.5 billion and creating some 20 000 quality jobs. A new batch of enterprises, including several world-leading pharmaceutical companies, will soon join their ranks.

One of Hong Kong's unique advantages is its role as a convergence point for international and Mainland data. This is particularly valuable for biotech enterprises engaged in clinical trials as well as drug discovery and development.

Artificial intelligence is central to the next wave of biotech innovation. Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry and a key enabler to transform other sectors. We are building our AI capabilities across five pillars: data, algorithms, computing power, capital and talent. In Hong Kong, a number of homegrown start-ups and foreign enterprises are actively engaged in AI-driven drug discovery, diagnostic tools and personalised medicine.

Access to capital

Second, Hong Kong offers biotech firms access to deep and diversified capital pools.

Our stock market is a prime example. In the first seven months of 2025, US$16 billion was raised through IPOs (initial public offerings) in Hong Kong, a six-fold increase compared to the same period last year. The biotech sector was a key beneficiary, with 15 IPOs raising nearly US$3 billion. The Hang Seng Biotech Index has surged more than 85 per cent, outperforming regional and global peers.

This growth builds on our capital market reforms. In 2018, we introduced a listing regime for pre-revenue biotech companies and companies with weighted voting rights structures. These reforms have transformed the Hong Kong stock market.

As of July, more than 75 biotech firms had listed under the reformed regime, raising over US$30 billion. This makes Hong Kong the second-largest biotech fundraising centre globally.

We are also enhancing our listing process. In line with this year's Budget, a dedicated channel for technology enterprises has been launched to provide tailored support to biotech and deep-tech firms preparing for IPOs. This initiative helps companies navigate the process with greater clarity and confidence.

Beyond public markets, we offer a robust private capital ecosystem. Hong Kong is home to over 650 private equity and venture capital firms, with US$230 billion in assets under management, second only to the Chinese Mainland in Asia.

We understand that some of the most cutting-edge biotech segments - such as novel proteins, frontier diagnostics and surgical robotics - require long-term investment. This is where patient capital comes into play. The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC), which was established in 2022 with US$8 billion initial capital, invests and co-invests in biotech and hardtech companies, among others. To date, it has deployed about 20 per cent of its invested capital in biotech projects.

The HKIC also plays a crucial role in connecting Hong Kong and Mainland innovations with global capital, enabling cross-border partnerships and supporting their effort to go global.

Supportive Government policies

Third, Hong Kong's policy and regulatory environment is supportive of biotech innovation.

In addition to the finance side mentioned earlier, we are working to establish a primary evaluation mechanism for drug approvals. This will allow Hong Kong to independently review and approve medical products and devices, aligning them with international standards and accelerating their time to the market.

To this end, we are establishing the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation. We have joined the International Council for Harmonisation as an observer and are investing in the needed infrastructure, systems and talent to support this transition. Our target is to begin phased implementation of the new framework in 2026, with full rollout by 2030.

This initiative will enhance Hong Kong's role as a base for R&D, clinical trials and regional co-operation. Indeed, for international pharmaceutical firms, approval in Hong Kong may serve as a strategic pathway to get faster access to the Mainland market, especially within the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

Our collaboration across the GBA continues to deepen. With 87 million residents, the GBA is a vast market for health products and a key resource for clinical research. In the Hetao Innovation and Technology Park, also known as the Loop Area, Hong Kong and Shenzhen have established cross-boundary clinical trial institutions that support studies complying with the standards and requirements of both jurisdictions.

We are also working to enable the seamless flow of data, capital, talent and other factors of production with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, creating an innovation corridor for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.

Welcoming global talent

Finally, talent is a cornerstone of our biotech strategy. Since late 2022, Hong Kong has received over 510 000 applications under various talent admission schemes, with more than 340 000 approvals and nearly 230 000 arrivals to date. And under one of the schemes - the Top Talent Pass Scheme, around 20 per cent of the talent are engaged in innovation and technology.

We continue to attract top researchers, scientists and professionals from around the world. There is a growing number of ethnic Chinese scientists looking to Hong Kong as a globally connected and friendly base to work.

Closing

Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities in biotechnology are enormous. With our institutional strengths, deep financial resources, research excellence, supportive government policies and world-class talent, Hong Kong has what it takes to shine in the next wave of biotech breakthroughs.

Whether you are an innovator seeking capital, an investor looking for promising projects, or an organisation seeking biotech solutions - Hong Kong welcomes you.

Let us work together to turn today's ideas into tomorrow's innovations.

Thank you, and I wish you all a successful and rewarding Forum."

​財政司司長出席中金公司2025粵港澳大灣區財富管理峰會致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-11 11:45,2025-09-11 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100337.htm,"以下是財政司司長陳茂波今日（九月十一日）出席中金公司2025粵港澳大灣區財富管理峰會的致辭：

徐衞剛部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部部長徐衞剛）、陳董事長（中金公司董事長、管理委員會主席陳亮）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好！很高興出席2025粵港澳大灣區財富管理峰會。適逢今年是中金公司成立30周年，並在香港交易所上市10周年，讓我們先對中金公司表示最熱烈的祝賀！也為中金舉辦此次峰會，匯聚各方智慧，共商香港和大灣區財富管理的未來發展，衷心點讚！

地緣政治的變化

當前世界百年變局正加速演進，地緣政治正在深刻重塑經濟體之間的關係，國際金融市場也因此出現了新的局面。對香港這個國際金融中心來說，確實面臨一些挑戰，但更多的是看到了機遇。

今年以來，國際政經格局緊隨着美國新政府的上場而變得緊張，單邊主義、保護主義的政策為全球經濟帶來了陰霾和不確定性。國際投資者越來越意識到必須通過多元化配置資産來分散風險，並更好捕捉全球不同地區的增長機遇。

但不管外圍環境怎樣變化，在中央的英明領導下，我國經濟一直平穩增長，投資價值正被國際投資者重新重視。如果說去年下半年國際投資者本來就有加大在這個地區投資的意願，年初DeepSeek的驚艷登場，可以說是點燃了全球對投資中國的熱情。許多投資者意識到此前低配了在中國市場的投資，並馬上積極調整配置。香港作為連接中外資本市場的「超級聯繫人」，在這一波的變化中可以說是受惠者。

一系列的數據說明，香港正在吸引更多全球資金匯聚。以股市為例，去年恒生指數上升18%，今年以來再上升了接近30%，IPO（首次公開招股）募資額已經超過1,300億元，再融資額超過3,400億元，都比去年同期大幅上升。銀行存款也上升接近8%，接近18.7萬億元。

資管業務的機遇

資金流入很自然帶動資產管理業務的增長。證監會（證券及期貨事務監察委員會）最新發布的調查指出，去年香港管理的資產總值按年增加13%至超過35萬億港元，是本地生產總值的11倍，淨資金流入更達7,050億港元，按年上升超過八成。與此同時，不少從事資產管理業務的金融機構都在香港擴充業務、增聘人手、租用更多商業樓面。金管局（香港金融管理局）的數據顯示，多家國際銀行和資産管理公司預計未來數年增聘的人手從10%至100%不等。事實上，根據業界估算，香港將在兩、三年內成為全球規模最大的跨境財富管理中心。

一直以來，在香港管理的資產，來自內地與香港投資者的跟來自海外的約各佔一半。隨着內地經濟持續發展和亞洲的富裕人口不斷增加，香港未來在資產及財富管理領域的發展更大有可為。

粵港澳大灣區將會是增長的重要動力源之一。二○二四年，大灣區的總人口已經超過8 700萬，地區生產總值超過14.5萬億元人民幣。區內居民自然希望有更多元的資產配置選擇。「跨境理財通」的推出和在其後的優化，讓更多大灣區的民眾可以接觸到香港多元和優質的財管產品與服務。截至二○二五年七月底，參與「跨境理財通」的個人投資者超過16萬人，總跨境匯劃金額超過1,200億元人民幣。

我們會繼續做好服務、優化產品，在中央有關部委的支持下，適時、適度擴大「跨境理財通」覆蓋的地域範圍、產品種類和參與群體。

「跨境理財通」以外，在中央的大力支持下，特區政府會繼續致力深化與內地金融市場的互聯互通，積極探索各項擴容增量方案，以穩妥和循序漸進的方式擴大互聯互通機制下的產品種類和涵蓋範圍，豐富內地投資者的選擇。

就吸引海外資金方面，我們也是多管齊下。例如，我們推出了多項政策措施，包括稅務優惠，吸引家族辦公室落戶香港。特區政府每年舉辦的「裕澤香江」高峰論壇，參加者來自東南亞、中東、歐美等地，展示了香港國際家族辦公室樞紐的地位。

在產品方面，我們也努力不斷創新，交易所買賣產品就是一個例子。它是一個正在蓬勃發展的市場，目前，在港交所（香港交易及結算所有限公司）上市的ETP（交易所買賣產品）超過210隻，種類非常多元化，包括投資不同地域的證券、衍生產品，以至數字資產等，佔股市成交量超過15%。我們會繼續把這個市場發展好，並進一步提升它在互聯互通機制內的貢獻。

此外，香港私募基金、風投基金的生態也十分蓬勃，管理資產規模接近2,300億美元，在亞洲僅次於內地。我們正穩慎推動開放更多私募基金給予零售投資者，豐富他們的選擇，也助力業界發展。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，一直以來，中金公司是國家金融市場的重要參與者與建設者，在國家金融改革與開放進程，以至金融強國建設中，擔當重要的角色，貢獻良多。我衷心感謝中金公司利用香港作為境外業務的樞紐，並推動內地企業通過香港「走出去」，又把優質國際資本「引進來」。我深信中金公司會繼續積極發揮資本市場投融資領頭羊的功能，助力香港提升金融市場的活力與競爭力，為國家金融強國建設作出新的、更大的貢獻。

最後，祝願今日的峰會圓滿成功，中金公司業務竿頭猛進，各位嘉賓、各位朋友身體健康、事業宏達！謝謝大家！"
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-11 06:48,2025-09-11 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100168.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 11) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

唐英年主席（西九文化區管理局董事局主席）、陳卓智主席（香港話劇團署理主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家好。我簡單講幾句。今晚非常高興——甚至有點小興奮——出席《大狀王》香港第三度公演閉幕酒會，與各位一同欣賞這部載譽歸來音樂劇的精彩演出。

《大狀王》自二○二二年首演以來，叫好叫座、越做越爆紅，不但在香港一票難求，在上海及北京巡演時亦大受好評，創下香港音樂劇在內地演出場次及觀眾人次的紀錄。《大狀王》至今已斬獲近30個重要獎項，是香港原創粵語音樂劇的神級里程碑之作，擦亮香港表演藝術的金漆招牌。

《大狀王》的成功，是「十年磨一劍」的成果。團隊以「一班人、一條心、講好一個故事」的信念，從構思、籌備和創作，千錘百煉，精雕細琢出一套細膩、充滿香港特色的音樂劇，融匯粵劇、古典、搖滾等多種音樂風格，舞台設計亦結合古今美學，充分展現香港文化中西合璧的特性，和創意蓬勃、多元共生的文化實力。

我祝賀《大狀王》團隊獲得空前的成功，希望你們日後能夠為我們帶來更多精彩的演出。我亦感謝西九文化區與香港話劇團合作，推動本地藝術發展，不但為觀眾帶來驚豔的視聽體驗，更成就了一批出色的演藝人才，推動本地文化藝術創意項目走向更廣闊的舞台。

最後，我期待香港繼續湧現更多優秀的原創作品，向世界弘揚中華文化，說好中國故事、香港故事。

多謝大家！"

10th Belt and Road Summit explores new opportunities and drives collaboration for a shared future (with photos),2025-09-10 20:56,2025-09-10 22:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000749.htm,"ããThe 10th Belt and Road Summit which opened today (September 10) and runs for two days brought together over 6 000 participants, including more than 90 government and business speakers, as well as over 100 delegations, to explore the opportunities arising from areas such as trade and commerce, investment, innovation and technology and green development, and yielded a record high of about 50 government and enterprise memorandums of understanding (MOUs), highlighting Hong Kong’s role as the functional platform for the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI).

ããHosted by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government since 2016, the Summit is a flagship event for Hong Kong’s participation in and contribution to the B&RI, and has become the premier B&R business and investment platform for local, Mainland and overseas enterprises. Under the theme ""Collaborate for change • Shape a shared future"", the 10th Summit featured new elements such as market spotlights, signature projects and collaborative capacity for sustainable development, exploring further collaboration opportunities for enterprises, the local professional services sectors and people-to-people exchanges.

  Speaking at the opening session, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said the Belt and Road Summit has united governments, businesses, peoples and cultures in collaboration for change. He said that over the past 10 years, more than 45 000 people from some 120 countries and regions have participated in the summit, with over 2 800 projects presented, shaping a shared vision through collaboration and connectivity, which are the fundamental values of the B&RI.

  Mr Lee said, ""The HKSAR Government is rapidly expanding Hong Kong's global trade networks. I have visited 12 Belt and Road countries in the past three years, leading high-level business delegations from Hong Kong to most of them and witnessing some 160 MOUs, and co-operation agreements and deliverables with the respective economies. We have signed free trade agreements with 14 Belt and Road countries, and investment agreements with about 20 Belt and Road economies, as well as Comprehensive Avoidence of Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions. Our external trade with Belt and Road countries exceeded US$276 billion last year, up about 80 per cent since 2013 and three times the average growth rate of Hong Kong's external merchandise trade over the same period. ""

  Mr Lee also introduced Hong Kong's advantages and developments in such areas as trade and investment, competitiveness, talent, connectivity, green and sustainable development and the legal system, highlighting that Hong Kong is an ideal B&R hub. He remarked that as the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage, Hong Kong stands as the premier gateway for co-operation, bridging people, trade, business, education, culture and values across the region, connecting Asia and the world. He said that Hong Kong's ""dual superpower"" as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" injects vigour, innovation, sustainability and strategic value to capital and projects, and will continue to drive high-quality development along the B&R.

  Also addressing the opening session were Vice Minister of Commerce Mr Yan Dong; Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council Mr Li Zhen; and Deputy Secretary General of the National Development and Reform Commission Mr Xiao Weiming. Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia Mr Sun Chanthol delivered a keynote speech at the opening session.

  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, gave welcome remarks at the Keynote Luncheon titled ""Fostering Regional Co-operation through Concrete Business Partnerships"". He shared with the audience how Hong Kong is fostering more partnerships and contributing to regional connectivity through leveraging on two important global trends - green and sustainable development, and digital innovation.

  On green and sustainable development, Mr Chan highlighted the Government’s vision for Hong Kong to become an international centre for green technology and green finance, playing its pivotal role in driving global green transition. In the area of green finance, the Government is actively promoting the development of transition finance, while also addressing the diverse needs of emerging economies through innovative financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds and the securitisation of infrastructure debt. At the same time, Hong Kong is accelerating its development into a green technology hub, contributing to regional decarbonisation efforts through cutting-edge innovation.

  Turning to digital innovation, Mr Chan said that for Belt and Road economies and the Global South, Hong Kong and the Mainland offers a wide spectrum of digital solutions, from fintech and smart health to cloud computing, 6G, and digital city management. Hong Kong has made AI one of our key strategic priorities, and is committed to building an open, collaborative and inclusive AI community. Meanwhile, it is embracing blockchain technology at the heart of financial innovation, leveraging on its potential to make cross-border transactions more efficient.

  The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, gave welcome remarks at the thematic breakout session titled ""Synergy in Legal Solutions: Co-creating a Shared Silk Road Vision"". He stated that the conclusion and execution of Belt and Road projects are bound to involve transboundary legal issues, in which international legal services are inevitable. Noting that Hong Kong international civil and commercial law and practice under its common law system are highly recognised by the international business community, Mr Lam highlighted Hong Kong’s advantages in various areas including the abundant legal professionals with rich experiences in international business law, credible and high-quality legal and dispute resolution services, and close legal collaborations with Belt and Road countries.

  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, chaired the policy dialogue on ""Embracing emerging opportunities in times of economic uncertainty"" at which he discussed with overseas government officials on forging economic co-operation with innovation, such as green economy and digitalisation, amid the uncertain geopolitical situation. Mr Yau also highlighted that the B&RI provides a readily available platform for international co-operation in facilitating trade and economic integration. Citing infrastructure development as one of the key strengths of the B&RI, he said that it helps enhance market access and reduce trade barriers, thereby generating investment, creating jobs and improving living standards.

  The Summit featured nine MOUs between the HKSAR Government and related organisations and their overseas counterparts to promote bilateral co-operation and exchanges, covering the Department of Justice, the Financial Services Development Council, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong Customs, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Invest Hong Kong and the Securities and Futures Commission, and Pakistan, Indonesia, Hungary, Qatar, Cambodia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The Summit also led to some 36 other MOUs in various areas. The total value of these MOUs, together with new projects and deals finalised before the summit, is close to US$1 billion.

  Under the themes of ""ASEAN: Unveiling new opportunities for growth and collaboration"" and ""Exploring frontiers in new markets and industries"", the plenary sessions gathered business leaders to discuss Hong Kong's role in facilitating trade and business co-operation under the B&RI. A number of thematic breakout sessions covering areas such as legal services, trade and commerce, insurance, architecture, green finance and logistics were also held to focus on fostering a more prosperous, green and interconnected future for B&R countries and regions.

  The HKSAR Government is proactively expanding overseas markets, especially the markets of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Middle East which present great potentials. The new B&R signature projects sessions at the Summit introduced tenders of urban development projects in Thailand and Saudi Arabia. The Belt and Road Office (BRO), together with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, launched an information sharing mechanism to assist Hong Kong enterprises and professional services in tapping the business opportunities in projects in ASEAN and the Middle East.

  The Summit was attended by over 200 Belt and Road Scholarship recipients, local university students, Youth Link members and Youth Development Commission Youth Ambassadors. A Youth Chapter will be held tomorrow (September 11) for young business leaders from Hong Kong, the Mainland and B&R countries to share their experience. The chapter’s new feature to foster exchanges among the participants will enable them to learn more about the latest B&R developments and opportunities.

  For enhanced synergies, the Government has encouraged various groups and organisations to host more than 20 B&R-related activities in the months around the Summit period, covering areas such as trade and business, arts and culture, music, sports and academia, for the business and professional sectors as well as the general public to take part and experience in person the achievements of global collaboration under the B&RI. The BRO also published a booklet on Hong Kong as a participant, contributor and beneficiary of the B&RI. Details of the activities and the booklet are available on the BRO’s website www.beltandroad.gov.hk."

10th Belt and Road Summit explores new opportunities and drives collaboration for a shared future,2025-09-10 20:56,2025-09-10 21:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000749.htm,"ããThe 10th Belt and Road Summit which opened today (September 10) and runs for two days brought together over 6 000 participants, including more than 90 government and business speakers, as well as over 100 delegations, to explore the opportunities arising from areas such as trade and commerce, investment, innovation and technology and green development, and yielded a record high of about 50 government and enterprise memorandums of understanding (MOUs), highlighting Hong Kong’s role as the functional platform for the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI).

ããHosted by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government since 2016, the Summit is a flagship event for Hong Kong’s participation in and contribution to the B&RI, and has become the premier B&R business and investment platform for local, Mainland and overseas enterprises. Under the theme ""Collaborate for change • Shape a shared future"", the 10th Summit featured new elements such as market spotlights, signature projects and collaborative capacity for sustainable development, exploring further collaboration opportunities for enterprises, the local professional services sectors and people-to-people exchanges.

  Speaking at the opening session, the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, said the Belt and Road Summit has united governments, businesses, peoples and cultures in collaboration for change. He said that over the past 10 years, more than 45 000 people from some 120 countries and regions have participated in the summit, with over 2 800 projects presented, shaping a shared vision through collaboration and connectivity, which are the fundamental values of the B&RI.

  Mr Lee said, ""The HKSAR Government is rapidly expanding Hong Kong's global trade networks. I have visited 12 Belt and Road countries in the past three years, leading high-level business delegations from Hong Kong to most of them and witnessing some 160 MOUs, and co-operation agreements and deliverables with the respective economies. We have signed free trade agreements with 14 Belt and Road countries, and investment agreements with about 20 Belt and Road economies, as well as Comprehensive Avoidence of Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions. Our external trade with Belt and Road countries exceeded US$276 billion last year, up about 80 per cent since 2013 and three times the average growth rate of Hong Kong's external merchandise trade over the same period. ""

  Mr Lee also introduced Hong Kong's advantages and developments in such areas as trade and investment, competitiveness, talent, connectivity, green and sustainable development and the legal system, highlighting that Hong Kong is an ideal B&R hub. He remarked that as the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage, Hong Kong stands as the premier gateway for co-operation, bridging people, trade, business, education, culture and values across the region, connecting Asia and the world. He said that Hong Kong's ""dual superpower"" as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" injects vigour, innovation, sustainability and strategic value to capital and projects, and will continue to drive high-quality development along the B&R.

  Also addressing the opening session were Vice Minister of Commerce Mr Yan Dong; Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council Mr Li Zhen; and Deputy Secretary General of the National Development and Reform Commission Mr Xiao Weiming. Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia Mr Sun Chanthol delivered a keynote speech at the opening session.

  The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, gave welcome remarks at the Keynote Luncheon titled ""Fostering Regional Co-operation through Concrete Business Partnerships"". He shared with the audience how Hong Kong is fostering more partnerships and contributing to regional connectivity through leveraging on two important global trends - green and sustainable development, and digital innovation.

  On green and sustainable development, Mr Chan highlighted the Government’s vision for Hong Kong to become an international centre for green technology and green finance, playing its pivotal role in driving global green transition. In the area of green finance, the Government is actively promoting the development of transition finance, while also addressing the diverse needs of emerging economies through innovative financial instruments such as catastrophe bonds and the securitisation of infrastructure debt. At the same time, Hong Kong is accelerating its development into a green technology hub, contributing to regional decarbonisation efforts through cutting-edge innovation.

  Turning to digital innovation, Mr Chan said that for Belt and Road economies and the Global South, Hong Kong and the Mainland offers a wide spectrum of digital solutions, from fintech and smart health to cloud computing, 6G, and digital city management. Hong Kong has made AI one of our key strategic priorities, and is committed to building an open, collaborative and inclusive AI community. Meanwhile, it is embracing blockchain technology at the heart of financial innovation, leveraging on its potential to make cross-border transactions more efficient.

  The Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, gave welcome remarks at the thematic breakout session titled ""Synergy in Legal Solutions: Co-creating a Shared Silk Road Vision"". He stated that the conclusion and execution of Belt and Road projects are bound to involve transboundary legal issues, in which international legal services are inevitable. Noting that Hong Kong international civil and commercial law and practice under its common law system are highly recognised by the international business community, Mr Lam highlighted Hong Kong’s advantages in various areas including the abundant legal professionals with rich experiences in international business law, credible and high-quality legal and dispute resolution services, and close legal collaborations with Belt and Road countries.

  The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, chaired the policy dialogue on ""Embracing emerging opportunities in times of economic uncertainty"" at which he discussed with overseas government officials on forging economic co-operation with innovation, such as green economy and digitalisation, amid the uncertain geopolitical situation. Mr Yau also highlighted that the B&RI provides a readily available platform for international co-operation in facilitating trade and economic integration. Citing infrastructure development as one of the key strengths of the B&RI, he said that it helps enhance market access and reduce trade barriers, thereby generating investment, creating jobs and improving living standards.

  The Summit featured nine MOUs between the HKSAR Government and related organisations and their overseas counterparts to promote bilateral co-operation and exchanges, covering the Department of Justice, the Financial Services Development Council, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong Customs, the Hong Kong Observatory, the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Invest Hong Kong and the Securities and Futures Commission, and Pakistan, Indonesia, Hungary, Qatar, Cambodia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The Summit also led to some 36 other MOUs in various areas. The total value of these MOUs, together with new projects and deals finalised before the summit, is close to US$1 billion.

  Under the themes of ""ASEAN: Unveiling new opportunities for growth and collaboration"" and ""Exploring frontiers in new markets and industries"", the plenary sessions gathered business leaders to discuss Hong Kong's role in facilitating trade and business co-operation under the B&RI. A number of thematic breakout sessions covering areas such as legal services, trade and commerce, insurance, architecture, green finance and logistics were also held to focus on fostering a more prosperous, green and interconnected future for B&R countries and regions.

  The HKSAR Government is proactively expanding overseas markets, especially the markets of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Middle East which present great potentials. The new B&R signature projects sessions at the Summit introduced tenders of urban development projects in Thailand and Saudi Arabia. The Belt and Road Office (BRO), together with the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, launched an information sharing mechanism to assist Hong Kong enterprises and professional services in tapping the business opportunities in projects in ASEAN and the Middle East.

  The Summit was attended by over 200 Belt and Road Scholarship recipients, local university students, Youth Link members and Youth Development Commission Youth Ambassadors. A Youth Chapter will be held tomorrow (September 11) for young business leaders from Hong Kong, the Mainland and B&R countries to share their experience. The chapter’s new feature to foster exchanges among the participants will enable them to learn more about the latest B&R developments and opportunities.

  For enhanced synergies, the Government has encouraged various groups and organisations to host more than 20 B&R-related activities in the months around the Summit period, covering areas such as trade and business, arts and culture, music, sports and academia, for the business and professional sectors as well as the general public to take part and experience in person the achievements of global collaboration under the B&RI. The BRO also published a booklet on Hong Kong as a participant, contributor and beneficiary of the B&RI. Details of the activities and the booklet are available on the BRO’s website www.beltandroad.gov.hk."

大家晚上好！歡迎出席「中國內地電影展2025」開幕典禮。

中國電影歷史經歷百年精彩，從黑白到高清，從稚嫩到成熟，近年更在世界舞台大放異彩。大家應該還記得今年農曆新年，《哪吒之魔童鬧海》以高超的製作技術和精彩的敍事手法取得全球電影票房榜第五名的佳績、動畫電影更是全球票房榜第一名。目前，中國已穩居全球第二大電影市場，為世界電影產業發展注入了強勁的動能、多元的創意和無窮的活力。

在國家「十四五」規劃的明確支持下，香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心，可持續發揮獨特的優勢，協助國家將電影業的影響力擴展至全世界。舉辦中國內地電影展，正正是為國家打開面向世界的窗口，以電影作為橋樑，跨越國界，連接心靈，促進文明互鑑。

今年電影展的開幕電影、大家待會會觀賞的《天堂旅行團》，由同名的暢銷小說改編而成，延續書中對生命意義的探討。講述兩位主人翁，一大一小，踏上未知的旅程，追尋生命的曙光，縱使面對逆境亦不放棄，以歡笑與淚水互相治癒的故事，再一次印證電影如何讓觀眾從中獲得勇氣與力量，克服生活中的困難，稍後請大家細心欣賞。

除了開幕電影外，正如司儀剛才介紹，電影展亦精選了11部由年輕導演執導的作品。這些電影涵蓋不同類型，以敏銳的視角、嶄新的手法和不斷求索的精神，從不同角度反映內地的社會現況，商業和藝術元素兼備，充分體現內地電影業的多彩、蓬勃發展。本屆中國內地電影展亦特別舉辦映後談、社區及大專院校免費放映會等一連串活動，希望通過互動交流，讓市民從更多角度欣賞百花齊放的內地電影業。

康樂及文化事務署一直致力推廣中國歷史和文化，「中國內地電影展」是弘揚中華文化系列活動之一，希望透過電影讓市民大眾認識博大精深的中華文化。今年二月，特區政府通過電影發展基金推出弘揚中華文化電影製作資助計劃，鼓勵香港導演將中華文化元素融入電影作品中，宣揚中華文化的魅力和多樣性，向觀眾展示中華文化的優秀傳統。

歷屆電影展能夠順利舉行，全賴各方緊密合作。在此，我衷心感謝湖南電影代表來港出席今晚的開幕典禮。此外，我謹代表香港特別行政區政府，向紫荊文化集團致以誠摯的謝意，並向南方電影文化基金會、銀都機構有限公司、華南電影工作者聯合會和中國電影基金會等合作夥伴一一致謝。

我祝願本屆電影展圓滿成功，並祝在座各位身體安康，謝謝大家。"
政制及內地事務局局長會見傳媒談話內容,2025-09-10 20:17,2025-09-10 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000762.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（九月十日）在立法會會議二讀辯論《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》後會見傳媒的談話內容：

政制及內地事務局局長：各位傳媒朋友，大家好。相信大家都知道，立法會剛剛完成投票，以大比數反對二讀《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》）。今次《條例草案》未獲通過，政府當然會感到失望，但這畢竟是立法會行使《基本法》下負責審議、制定法案的職能和權力，立法會議員是反映社會各界和市民意見的代議士，既然議員認為《條例草案》未能反映現時香港社會的主流意見，未能凝聚共識，政府會尊重立法會的決定和投票結果。我再次感謝各位議員在審議期間盡責履職，認真審議今次《條例草案》，這亦反映立法會的認真專業態度和對法庭裁決的尊重。

政府亦再次重申，政府尊重法治，尊重法院的裁決。今次推出《條例草案》的目的正是履行終審法院就岑子杰案宣告政府根據《香港人權法案》第十四條須履行的積極義務，即透過立法制定替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律的承認，並制定伴隨的適當權利和責任。政府的立法建議充分考慮了法院的裁決要求、香港的實際情況、傳統價值觀、社會的和諧穩定以及整體利益，並在當中取得適當平衡，以形成社會上的「最大公約數」。事實上，即使在世界各地，不同地方亦會按照其憲制傳統、法律程序和社會價值觀去制定合適的法律。

而在整個推進立法的過程中，政府已盡最大努力，爭取社會和立法會的支持，在終審法院定下的暫緩限期內履行有關積極義務。雖然今次立法會的表決結果並未能與政府的立法建議一致，但就行政、立法、司法機關各自按照《基本法》履行其憲制責任和職能而言，卻起了積極的示範作用，充分顯示其各司其職，相互尊重，並有效發揮其功能，共同致力維護香港整體利益和社會和諧穩定。

政府亦明白，關注同性伴侶權益的人士和團體或者會對今次立法會的表決結果感到失望。然而，香港作為一個多元包容的社會，社會存在不同的聲音和意見是十分正常的事情，政府亦希望大家能以理性的態度對待今次的結果。雖然大家的價值觀和觀點有所不同，但我們必須珍惜和維護我們得來不易的社會團結及和諧穩定。

對香港同性伴侶而言，即使今日《條例草案》未獲通過，但他們的權利在不同方面亦受到保障，包括經法庭裁決而確認在不同範疇上可享有的權利和保障，例如申請受養人簽證來港居留、評稅安排、申請公屋以及繼承遺產等。

政府已經按照法庭的裁決，向立法會提交一個替代框架的建議，而《條例草案》被否決，政府亦不會向法院申請延長暫緩令的期限。下一步，我們會與律政司就議題作進一步商討和研究。

記者：政府早前表示提出《條例草案》是為了維護法治，現時立法會否決《條例草案》，是否表示特區的法治會受到嚴重影響？

政制及內地事務局局長：政府一向強調，我們十分尊重法治，尊重法庭的裁決。正因如此，我們因應法庭的裁決，推出今次的《條例草案》，以履行我們在《人權法》下的積極義務。而整個立法過程中，大家都有目共睹，由條例草擬、方案制訂，以至推出條例、種種向立法會和公眾的解說和游說工作，都證明我們盡最大努力，希望達致方案完成，獲得立法會支持通過。至於立法會方面，大家亦留意到，立法會議員自方案推出以來，都盡責履職，專業認真地審議法案，同時亦收取不同的公眾意見，在會議上如實反映。這些都反映大家對香港的法治，以至法庭的裁決十分尊重。因此，我們不認為香港的法治會因為這樣而受到任何衝擊或影響。相反地，在目前的政治架構安排上，行政、立法和司法各司其職，相互尊重下，在法治的前提下進行各方面工作。

記者：立法會現在已經否決了《條例草案》，政府下一步的工作是甚麽？剛才局長說政府在現階段不會申請延期，即如何履行持續的積極義務以遵守法院的命令？

政制及內地事務局局長：正如我剛才所說，我們下一步會與律政司進一步商討，研究下一步的工作怎樣進行。至於延期方面，目前我們不會向法院申請延期。主要來說，因為大家看到，今次推出的法案，以至法案未獲通過，無論立法會各議員、政黨，以至市民各方面都存在很大的分歧，暫時仍未形成共識，這正正反映問題的複雜性和敏感性。我們相信政府需要時間進一步進行研究。目前，在未有具體的工作計劃和時間表的情況下，我們暫時沒有基礎向法庭申請延期。

記者：政府推出《條例草案》的目的是履行法院的裁決，但現時《條例草案》得不到立法會的支持，這情況會否造成行政、立法、司法不協調甚至憲制上的危機呢？

政制及內地事務局局長：今次行政機關是按照司法機關的裁決實施立法建議，亦一直很努力推進立法工作；至於立法會方面，亦見到他們因應立法建議，作出認真的審議，盡責履職地進行審議工作，其間亦提出很多寶貴意見，聽取很多市民意見，在議會上作出如實反映。這次無論在行政、立法及司法，三方面都相互很有效地運作，在各司其職、互相尊重的情況下，我不認為存在所謂的不協調情況，甚至憲制危機。我完全看不到這個情況。

The agreement aims to enhance bilateral economic and investment co-operation, further solidifying Hong Kong's role as a global business hub and a gateway to the Mainland and beyond.

  The MOU was signed by the Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, with the Chief Executive Officer of Invest Oman, Mr Nasser Al Kindi. The agreement underscores the commitment of both parties to fostering both inward and outward investment and exploring new opportunities for collaboration in trade, investment, and technology.
  
  Ms Lau said, ""Oman is a key player in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The signing of this MOU with Invest Oman during the Belt and Road Summit today marks a significant milestone in Hong Kong's efforts to strengthen its economic ties with the Middle East. Hong Kong's world-class financial services, professional expertise, and strategic location make it an ideal partner for businesses looking to expand their global footprint. We look forward to working closely with our counterpart in Oman to unlock new opportunities for mutual growth, particularly in the context of the BRI.""

Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs: As I just said, the Government is not going to apply for any extension of time from the Court for the moment but we will further discuss with the DoJ (Department of Justice) to see how to take forward the matter.

As regards the rule of law of Hong Kong, the Government has all along fully respected the rule of law of Hong Kong as well as the Court's ruling. And that's why we introduced the Bill this time to discharge our positive obligations under the Hong Kong BoR (Bill of Rights) as ruled by the court. And throughout the whole legislative process, you can see that from our detailed analysis of the judgement to see how to fulfil the requirements as set out by the court, to the drafting of the Bill, the introduction of the Bill, and also all the explanatory and lobbying work that we have done to solicit support from the Legislative Council as well as the public. You can see that we have tried our best to pursue the legislative process as well as to fulfil our obligations. As regards of the Legislative Council, you can see that they have dutifully and effectively discharged their functions and obligations under the Basic Law to closely scrutinise the Bill, and to render advice to the Government, and also to reflect the views of the public to us.

立法會十八題：預防蚊傳疾病,2025-09-10 19:06,2025-09-10 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000674.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上梁文廣議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

衞生署衞生防護中心指出，隨着夏季氣溫及雨量上升，蚊傳疾病（包括基孔肯雅熱及登革熱）的傳播風險增加。據報香港鄰近地區已出現基孔肯亞熱的疫情，而登革熱在過往夏季亦曾出現本地爆發。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年本港每年錄得的基孔肯雅熱及登革熱個案數目分別為何，以及當中分別有多少宗屬本地及輸入個案；

（二）過去三個月，在各口岸的健康篩檢工作中發現多少宗發燒個案，以及當中有多少宗最終確診為蚊傳疾病；

（三）衞生署如何在各口岸（包括各陸路口岸及機場）加強對來自蚊傳疾病高風險地區旅客的健康篩檢工作，例如會否考慮為出現相關病徵的旅客和相關航班乘客進行快速檢測，以縮短確診蚊傳疾病時間；

（四）食物環境衞生署及相關政府部門如何加強本港蚊患嚴重地區的滅蚊工作，以及今年至今的滅蚊工作詳情為何；及

（五）政府會否考慮引入新技術以提升滅蚊效率？

答覆：

主席：

衞生署衞生防護中心一直密切監察世界各地蚊傳疾病（包括問題提及的登革熱和基孔肯雅熱）的情況。

就登革熱，世界衞生組織（世衞）資料顯示，全球發病率在過去二十年顯著上升，構成重大公共衞生挑戰。登革熱患者可能會出現高燒、嚴重頭痛、眼窩後疼痛、肌肉及關節痛、噁心、嘔吐、淋巴結腫脹及出疹。有些人在感染後沒有明顯病徵，有些則只有發熱及出疹等輕微及不明確病徵。第一次感染的病情一般較輕，病癒後對該血清型病毒會產生終生免疫能力，但對其他三種血清型病毒只有部分和短暫的交叉免疫能力。若隨後感染其他血清型的登革熱病毒，出現重症登革熱的機會則較高，可導致死亡。在二○二三年，全球80多個國家／地區曾經錄得本地傳播個案，共呈報了逾650萬宗病例（包括7 300多宗死亡個案），而二○二四年更錄得超過1 400萬宗病例，創歷史新高。

就基孔肯雅熱而言，世衞資料顯示全球超過110個國家／地區曾經錄得本地傳播個案。患者可能會出現發燒和嚴重關節痛。由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，並多數與其他已存在的健康問題有關。大部分患者可以完全痊癒。今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。廣東省（尤其佛山市）自七月起錄得超過10 000宗基孔肯雅熱病例，病情一般輕微而當中沒有死亡個案，情況在八月下旬已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案。自七月開始本港亦錄得從世界各地有病例地區的零星輸入個案，顯示爆發風險依然存在，市民不應掉以輕心。

另外，日本腦炎也是一種經蚊子傳播的疾病，而香港亦曾錄得輸入個案。日本腦炎主要流行於亞洲及西太平洋地區的郊外及農村，尤其在氣候炎熱的季節。大部分病人均病情輕微，除發燒及頭痛外，一般不會有其他顯著病徵，但每250宗感染中便大約有一宗會出現嚴重病情，病徵包括迅速出現高燒、頭痛、頸部僵硬、喪失方向知覺、昏迷、抽搐、痙攣性癱瘓，甚至死亡。

白紋伊蚊是登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的傳播媒介，而日本腦炎的主要病媒蚊是庫蚊。針對蚊傳疾病的防控，防蚊滅蚊工作至為重要。在環境及生態局主持的跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會下，相關政府政策局及部門已實施多項預防及控制蚊傳疾病的措施。

就梁文廣議員的提問，經諮詢環境及生態局和衞生署後，本局現回覆如下：

（一）登革熱方面，本港於過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）每年錄得2至161宗個案，大部分為輸入個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年累計錄得44宗登革熱個案，全部為輸入個案，來自印度、印度尼西亞、菲律賓、泰國、馬來西亞、柬埔寨、斐濟、斯里蘭卡、孟加拉國及新加坡。詳細數字載於下表。

基孔肯雅熱方面，本港於過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）未有錄得任何個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱個案，全部屬輸入個案，七宗來自中國內地（廣東省佛山市）、四宗來自孟加拉國、一宗來自印度尼西亞及一宗來自斯里蘭卡。

日本腦炎方面，本港過去五年（二○二○至二○二四年）沒有錄得個案。截至二○二五年九月四日，本港今年錄得一宗輸入個案，來自菲律賓。

（二）於二○二五年六月至八月期間，衞生署於口岸健康篩查中，發現991宗入境旅客發燒個案，當中沒有確診蚊傳疾病的個案。

（三）衞生署在所有跨境口岸（即香港國際機場及連接廣東省的各個陸路及水路口岸）執行對入境人士的健康篩檢措施，包括進行體溫檢測及按機制為發燒個案或有病徵的旅客（例如自行申報不適的旅客）作進一步健康評估，並透過填寫健康評估表，了解其病徵、旅遊史及接觸史等，以便作出適切轉介及跟進。

自廣東省衞生當局於今年七月中報告基孔肯雅熱疫情，衞生署港口衞生科跟深圳海關保持緊密聯繫，並深化雙方通報機制，確保兩地口岸的防控措施能順利執行。若有發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客經港口衞生科人員評估後被懷疑患有基孔肯雅熱，會立即被安排轉送至香港公立醫院作跟進處理。至今未在口岸發現懷疑基孔肯雅熱個案。

衞生署港口衞生科會繼續與相關持份者（如航空公司及旅遊業界等）保持緊密聯繫，適時更新疾病資訊和健康建議；港口衞生科人員亦會嚴格監控各口岸的環境衞生，加強巡查，全面落實口岸防蚊及控蚊措施，確保良好環境衞生及病媒控制工作到位。

蚊傳疾病（包括登革熱、基孔肯雅熱和日本腦炎）的潛伏期較長，甚至可達約兩星期，單靠入境時的港口衞生措施偵測感染個案的效用並不顯著。與此同時，登革熱和基孔肯雅熱感染者血液內的病毒含量一般而言在發病後首數日最高，因此在病發初期的準確診斷需要通過對患者血液進行病毒核酸測試。登革熱和基孔肯雅熱核酸檢測產品亦需在實驗室由專業人員使用，目前市面上並沒有獲國際衞生當局認證可供實驗室以外自行使用的相關快速核酸測試產品。至於市面上的基孔肯雅熱快速檢測，是針對患者體內的抗體作測試。由於身體感染基孔肯雅熱後一般需要大約一星期才會對基孔肯雅病毒產生抗體，因此相關快速檢測不適合用於病發初期，會出現假陰性情況，亦不能縮短確診時間。

（四）各政府部門一直積極採取防蚊滅蚊措施。環境及生態局分別在今年三月和七月召開跨部門防治蟲鼠督導委員會會議，檢視蚊患最新情況和各部門的防治蚊患工作。在跨部門協調機制下，食物環境衞生署（食環署）和各相關部門已進行一系列防治蚊患工作，並因應鄰近地區出現基孔肯亞熱個案的情況採取多項加強措施，詳情如下︰

病媒監測

食環署持續在全港不同地點放置誘蚊器，以監察可傳播登革熱和基孔肯雅熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生情況，並通過部門網頁及政府地理空間信息樞紐平台，定期公布各分區誘蚊器指數，讓各部門和持份者可因應監察結果採取針對性滅蚊措施。為進一步加強防控，食環署自今年八月起將原先在分區誘蚊器指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

減少蚊子滋生地點及滅蚊

食環署防治蚊患的工作以環境防治為核心，着重減少蚊子滋生地點，並運用生物或化學方法，包括施放殺幼蟲劑和進行霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，從而控制蚊子數量。今年一月至八月期間，食環署各分區共進行逾22 000次霧化處理殺滅成蚊行動。

另外，食環署亦加強巡查建築地盤及工地等高危地點。今年一月至八月期間，食環署共提出103宗檢控，包括95宗涉及建築地盤，8宗涉及其他處所。自今年八月，食環署已向建築地盤及工地發出逾200張法定通知，指示其清理積水。

跨部門及跨界別協作

食環署在全港各分區均召開「跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組」特別會議，協調相關部門和持份者聯手採取針對性及持久性的防蚊滅蚊措施，包括積極在轄下處所和場地採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

食環署並已發信予物業管理及防治蟲鼠業界，呼籲向其負責管理屋苑的業戶或工作單位宣傳和落實滅蚊措施。此外，食環署已與物業管理業監管局和衞生防護中心合作舉辦大型講座，向約3 000名物管業界人員介紹基孔肯雅熱防控資訊。

食環署亦聯同發展局，透過建造業議會向200多個地盤及相關人員發出《給建築地盤的防蚊指引》，提醒從業員做好防治蚊患工作及個人防護；及在新學年開始前，透過教育局向全港逾2 000所學校（包括幼稚園、中小學）發出《給學校的防蚊指引》，協助校方防範蚊傳疾病傳播的風險。

（五）食環署會持續應用科技以加強滅蚊成效，例如引入2 000多個新型捕蚊器，即利用成蚊作為載體，把生長調節劑帶到不同水體，使水體中的孑孓不能發育為成蚊，以抑制成蚊的密度。此外，食環署正聯同機電工程署實地試驗利用機械狗在叢林等較難進入的地方進行霧化工作，提升控蚊效果。

食環署會密切留意世衞和各地在滅蚊方面的最新資訊，並研究各種新技術及產品在本港應用的可行性。如有合適的新技術及產品，食環署會積極考慮引入及應用。"
LCQ18: Prevention of mosquito-borne diseases,2025-09-10 19:06,2025-09-10 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000677.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Leung Man-kwong and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health (DH) has pointed out that, with the increase in temperature and rainfall in summer, the risk of transmission of mosquito-borne diseases (including chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF)) increases. It has been reported that outbreaks of CF have occurred in neighbouring areas of Hong Kong, and local outbreaks of DF were seen in past summers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the respective numbers of CF and DF cases recorded in Hong Kong in each of the past five years, and among them, the respective numbers of local and imported cases;

(2) of the number of fever cases detected in the health screening work at various boundary control points (BCPs) in the past three months, and among them, the number of cases eventually confirmed to be mosquito-borne diseases;

(3) how DH will strengthen the health screening work for travellers from areas with high risk of mosquito-borne diseases at various BCPs (including all land BCPs and the airport), for example, whether it will consider conducting rapid tests on travellers showing relevant symptoms and passengers on relevant flights, so as to shorten the time required for confirming mosquito-borne diseases;

(4) how the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and relevant government departments will step up mosquito control efforts in areas with serious mosquito infestation in Hong Kong, and of the details of such mosquito control work so far this year; and

(5) whether the Government will consider introducing new technologies to enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control work?

Reply:

President,

  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) has all along been closely monitoring the global situation of mosquito-borne diseases (including dengue fever (DF) and chikungunya fever (CF) mentioned in the question).

  Regarding DF, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global incidence of DF has markedly increased over the past two decades, posing a substantial public health challenge. DF patients may have high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, swollen lymph nodes and rash. Some infected people may not develop apparent symptoms, while some may only have mild and non-specific symptoms such as fever and rash. The symptoms of first infection are usually mild. Once recovered, lifelong immunity to that serotype of dengue virus will develop. However, cross-immunity to the other three serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. Subsequent infections with other serotypes of dengue virus are more likely to result in severe dengue or even progress to death. In 2023, over 6.5 million cases (including more than 7 300 deaths) were reported in over 80 countries/regions. In 2024, over 14 million cases were recorded, which was a record high.

  Regarding CF, according to the WHO, CF cases with local transmission have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Patient may suffer from fever and debilitating joint pain. Severe symptoms and deaths from CF are rare and usually related to other coexisting health problems. Most patients recover fully. From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Guangdong Province (especially Foshan City) has recorded more than 10 000 CF cases since July. The illness was generally mild with no deaths reported. The situation was under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day. Since July, Hong Kong has also recorded sporadic imported cases from different places around the world where there are confirmed cases, indicating that the risk of an outbreak still exists and the public should stay vigilant.

  In addition, Japanese encephalitis (JE) is also a mosquito-borne disease and imported cases have also been recorded in Hong Kong. JE occurs mainly in the rural and agricultural areas of Asia and the Western Pacific Region, especially during hot seasons. Most infections occur without apparent symptoms or with mild symptoms such as fever and headache. However, approximately one in every 250 infections is associated with severe illness characterised by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, and even death.

  Aedes albopictus is the vector for both DF and CF; and the Culex species is the principal vector for JE. For the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito prevention and control work is of paramount importance. Under the interdepartmental Pest Control Steering Committee (PCSC) convened by the Environment and Ecology Bureau (EEB), relevant government bureaux and departments have implemented various prevention and control measures against mosquito-borne diseases.

  In response to the Hon Leung Man-kwong's enquiry, our reply in consultation with the EEB and the DH is as follows:

(1) On DF, Hong Kong recorded two to 161 DF cases annually in the past five years (2020 to 2024), with the majority being imported cases. As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded 44 DF cases this year, all being imported cases from India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Fiji, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Singapore. Detailed figures are in the following table.

  On CF, no local case has been recorded in Hong Kong in the past five years (2020 to 2024). As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded 13 CF cases this year, all being imported cases, with seven cases from the Mainland China (Foshan City of Guangdong Province), four cases from Bangladesh, one case from Indonesia and one case from Sri Lanka.

  On JE, Hong Kong has not recorded any cases in the past five years (2020 to 2024). As of September 4, 2025, Hong Kong has recorded one imported case from the Philippines in 2025.

(2) From June to August 2025, the DH detected 991 fever cases among inbound travellers during health screenings at the boundary control points (BCPs). None of these cases was confirmed to have mosquito-borne diseases.

(3) The DH implements health screening measures for inbound travellers at all cross-border ports (including the Hong Kong International Airport and land and sea ports connecting to the Guangdong Province). These measures involve temperature checks and, when necessary, further health assessments for individuals with fever or those reporting symptoms (e.g. those self-reporting discomfort) according to the established mechanism. A health assessment form is used to gather information on symptoms, travel history and contact history, which enables appropriate referrals and follow-up actions.

  Since reporting of a CF outbreak by the heath authorities of the Guangdong Province in mid-July this year, the Port Health Division (PHD) of the DH has maintained close liaison with Shenzhen Customs and enhanced mutual notification mechanisms to ensure smooth implementation of port control measures. If travellers with fever or related symptoms are suspected of having CF after assessment by PHD staff, they will be immediately referred to public hospitals in Hong Kong for follow-up. No suspected CF cases have been found at the BCPs so far.

  The PHD of the DH continues to maintain close communication with relevant stakeholders (e.g. airlines and tourism industry) to update disease information and health advice promptly. PHD staff will also closely monitor environmental hygiene at all BCPs, strengthen inspections, fully implement mosquito prevention and control work at BCPs, and ensure good environmental hygiene and vector control measures are in place.

  Mosquito-borne diseases (including DF, CF and JE) have a long incubation period, potentially up to about two weeks. Port health measures alone are therefore insufficient to detect infected cases at the place of entry. At the same time, for DF and CF, the viral load in an infected person's blood is the highest in the first few days after symptom onset. Therefore, the diagnosis during the early stage of the diseases is accurate only through viral nucleic acid testing of the patient's blood. DF and CF nucleic acid testing products must be used by professional personnel in laboratory settings. Currently, there are no rapid nucleic acid test products on the market that have been certified by international health authorities for self-testing outside laboratory settings. As for the existing rapid test kits for CF on the market, they target antibodies in patient's body. Since the body typically takes about a week to produce antibodies against the chikungunya virus, such rapid tests are not suitable for use in the early stage of the diseases and may result in false negatives, thereby unable to shorten the time for diagnosis.

(4) All departments concerned have been actively implementing anti-mosquito measures. The EEB held interdepartmental PCSC meetings in March and July this year respectively to review the latest situation of the mosquito problem and the mosquito prevention and control work carried out by various departments. Under the inter-departmental coordination mechanism, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have carried out a series of mosquito prevention and control work, as well as strengthened the related measures in response to CF cases reported in neighbouring regions. The details of the enhanced measures are as follows:

Vector surveillance

  The FEHD continues to place gravidtraps in different areas across Hong Kong for monitoring the infestation of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit DF and CF. The FEHD publishes the Area Gravidtrap Indices (AGI) on its departmental webpage and the Government's Geospatial Information Hub platform on a regular basis, so that government departments and stakeholders can adopt targeted mosquito control measures with respect to the surveillance results. To further step up mosquito prevention and control, since August this year, the FEHD has extended its strengthened mosquito control work, which was originally initiated when the AGI of an area has reached 20 per cent, to also cover areas with AGI between 10 per cent and 20 per cent. The FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessment for the areas concerned to identify locations with more severe mosquito infestation, so as to carry out intensive and targeted mosquito control work jointly with other departments and stakeholders. The FEHD will also notify the nearby housing estates, advising their property management companies and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking anti-mosquito measures.

Minimising mosquito breeding grounds and eliminating mosquitoes

  With the primary focus on environmental control, the FEHD's mosquito prevention and control work focuses on minimising mosquito breeding grounds. Biological or chemical methods, including applying larvicides and conducting fogging operations, are carried out to eliminate adult mosquitoes so as to control their population. From January to August 2025, the FEHD conducted over 22 000 fogging operations across the territory to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

  In addition, the FEHD has stepped up inspections of high-risk locations such as construction sites and works sites. From January to August 2025, the FEHD instituted a total of 103 prosecutions, including 95 cases involving construction sites and eight cases involving other premises. Since August 2025, the FEHD has issued over 200 statutory notices to construction sites and works sites, instructing them to clear stagnant water.

Inter-departmental and cross-sectoral collaboration

  The FEHD has convened special meetings of the inter-departmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to coordinate with relevant departments and stakeholders in implementing targeted and sustained mosquito prevention and control measures, including actively implementing anti-mosquito measures in their respective premises and venues.

  The FEHD issued letters to the property management sector and the pest control sector, calling on them to promote and implement anti-mosquito measures among the residents or work units of the housing estates under their management. Moreover, the FEHD, the Property Management Services Authority and the CHP jointly held a large-scale seminar providing information on the prevention and control measures against CF for about 3 000 practitioners of the property management sector.

  The FEHD has also collaborated with the Development Bureau to issue the ""Guidelines on Mosquito Prevention in Construction Sites"" to over 200 construction sites and relevant personnel through the Construction Industry Council, reminding the practitioners to take appropriate anti-mosquito and personal protective measures. In addition, prior to the start of the new school year, the FEHD issued the ""Guidelines on Mosquito Prevention in Schools"" through the Education Bureau to over 2 000 schools across the territory, including kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools, so as to facilitate preventing the risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission in schools.

(5) The FEHD has been applying technologies to enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control. For example, the FEHD has adopted over 2 000 new mosquito trapping devices, using adult mosquitoes as carriers to carry growth regulators to different water bodies so that larvae in the water bodies cannot develop into adult mosquitoes, to suppress the density of adult mosquitoes. Moreover, the FEHD is working with the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department to conduct on-site trials on robot dogs carrying out fogging operations at inaccessible places such as shrubby areas to enhance the anti-mosquito effectiveness.

  The FEHD will closely monitor the latest information from the WHO and other places concerning mosquito control measures. The FEHD will also study the feasibility of introducing the new technologies and products to Hong Kong. Should any suitable new technologies and products be identified, the FEHD will actively consider their introduction and application."

阮家儀對香港城市文化有著獨特的情感連結及觀察。她喜愛利用收集充滿懷舊韻味的舊物創作藝術裝置，並借助燈光投影技術，喚起觀眾的集體回憶，以及對城市變遷的關注和反思。

兩組作品於香港視覺藝術中心三樓至五樓公共空間展出。《幻影》靈感源自一九九○年代在商場公共區域流行的音樂噴泉。阮家儀巧妙地融合動態光影與承載集體記憶的現成物，例如快餐店兒童餐的玩具、室內遊樂場的揼蟹機等，創作出有趣的立體雕塑。在光影的律動變化中，喚起人們對昔日商場公共空間的記憶，並引發觀眾對消費文化與童年記憶的深刻思考。

另一組作品《城市穿搭指南》則延續阮家儀的標誌性創作風格，在輸送帶上排列了各地名勝的紀念擺設，在光影投射下拼湊出一個世界地圖的縮影。

展覽由康樂及文化事務署主辦、香港視覺藝術中心籌劃。展覽於九月十日至明年二月九日在中區堅尼地道7A香港視覺藝術中心舉行，免費入場。有關展覽詳情，可瀏覽網頁www.apo.hk/tc/web/apo/va_mirage.html，或致電2521 3008查詢。"
Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre showcases large-scale lighting installations by artist Angela Yuen (with photos),2025-09-10 19:05,2025-09-10 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025090900666.htm,"  The Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre of the Art Promotion Office is staging the new exhibition ""Mirage"" from today (September 10), featuring two sets of new large-scale site-specific art installation works created by Hong Kong artist Angela Yuen.

Yuen has a unique emotional connection and artistic perspective on Hong Kong's urban culture. She utilises collected nostalgic found objects to create artworks. With the support of light projection techniques, her works evoke collective memories in the audience and prompt viewers to reflect on the evolving pace of urban society.

The two sets of installation works are on display in the public areas from the third to the fifth floor of the centre. The work ""Mirage"" is inspired by the musical fountains that were popular in mall public spaces during the 1990s. Yuen skilfully integrates dynamic light and shadow with ready-made objects that embody shared recollections, such as toys from children's meals from fast food restaurants and the crab-claw machines from indoor playgrounds, to create captivating sculptures. Through the rhythmic interplay of light and movement, the work prompts viewers to evoke memories of malls as public spaces and invites deeper reflection on consumer culture and childhood memories.

  Another artwork, ""City Styling Manual"", on display continues Yuen's signature creative approach.Souvenirs depicting iconic landmarks from around the world are arranged on a conveyor belt, interplaying with light and shadow to create a miniature world map.

The exhibition is presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and is organised by the Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre. The exhibition will run from September 10 to February 9 next year at the centre (7A Kennedy Road, Central). Admission is free.

立法會：政制及內地事務局局長動議恢復二讀辯論《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-09-10 18:54,2025-09-10 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000736.htm,"以下是政制及內地事務局局長曾國衞今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上動議恢復二讀辯論《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》）的發言全文：

代主席：

首先，我衷心感謝《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》法案委員會主席陳勇議員，以及各位委員、秘書處以及法律顧問所作的努力，令《條例草案》的審議工作得以順利高效完成。

我亦感謝立法會以及不同團體和社會人士透過不同渠道就《條例草案》向我們表達各種寶貴意見。特區政府對這些意見十分重視，並會在我們制訂相關安排時予以適當考慮。

正如政府一再強調，今次推出《條例草案》的目的，是履行終審法院在岑子杰對律政司司長案中宣告政府根據《香港人權法案》第十四條須履行的積極義務，即透過立法機制替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認，並制訂伴隨的適當權利和責任。

而在整個推動立法的過程中，政府一直秉持着尊重法治、尊重終審法院裁決的精神，致力認真研究判詞的內容以及如何達致法院的裁決要求，並充分考慮香港的實際情況、傳統價值觀以及社會和諧穩定因素，從而作出適當平衡，形成社會「最大公約數」，以確保在適當維護同性伴侶人士權益的同時，亦符合香港的整體利益。而在推進有關法案時，政府亦不遺餘力地向立法會及公眾作出清晰詳細解說和游說，盡最大努力希望法案獲得立法會支持通過。這是政府對法院裁決的負責任行為，亦是積極維護社會整體利益和和諧穩定的務實做法。

而在立法會方面，我們亦樂見從法案推出以來，議員們都盡責履職地認真就法案進行審議並提出不同意見。作為社會民意代表的代議士，當遇上這類富爭議性而社會上又確實存在不同聲音和意見的議題，議員們有不同看法和意見實屬正常。關鍵是大家都能夠明白到這是終審法院的最終裁決而又為社會所高度關注，因此都格外審慎進行審議和提出意見，同時亦不斷收集聽取市民的各種不同意見，實事求是地在議會上作出反映。這本身亦是對法治以至法院裁決的尊重表現，亦充分反映在現行特區政治架構中，行政、立法、司法機關各司其職、相互尊重，有效發揮着各自的職能和責任，共同維護促進特區的穩定和諧發展。

在法案審議過程中，議員都提出不少務實的意見和建議，當中包括有議員擔心法案一旦獲得通過，會對傳統婚姻制度造成嚴重衝擊。政府亦一再鄭重強調，必定會堅決維護本港「一夫一妻、一男一女」的傳統婚姻制度。在岑子杰案中，終審法院的判詞亦明確確認，香港居民根據《基本法》及《香港人權法案》所保證和保障的婚姻憲法自由只限於異性婚姻，並把同性婚姻排除在外。這是香港社會傳承已久的核心家庭價值觀念，亦是構成社會穩定的重要基石，政府對此立場堅定，而建議的同性伴侶登記制度絕對不等同承認有關關係在香港擁有與婚姻相同的法律地位。

另外，亦有意見認為政府要求同性伴侶須在外地註冊後才可在本港進行登記，會為有關人士帶來不便和不公。這點我們在法案委員會會議上已作出多次詳細解說。制訂這項要求的主要原因，是政府在登記時須確認有關關係為已作出承諾及穩定的關係，而建議的做法可提供客觀的準則和清晰的驗證，在行政執行上較為可行；而對登記人而言，亦可減少在核實過程中可能帶來的不便。因此，我們認為有關做法是合適的，亦不會對登記人造成太大困難。

此外，亦有意見認為，政府給予同性伴侶的權利不足，甚至有違終審法院的裁決。我們亦多次強調，法院的要求是我們須履行積極義務，讓同性伴侶受到法律保障，免其私生活受到侵擾。而我們目前的方案，一方面設立法律承認機制，讓同性伴侶在透露其同性關係時免卻其私人生活受到干擾，同時亦給予核心權利，讓同性伴侶可滿足「基本的社會需求」。這已經是符合法庭的要求，至於具體權利的制訂，法院已明確表明行政及立法機關是有彈性的酌情空間，而我們按照香港的實際情況和整體利益作出考量和制訂，是絕對合理和合法的。

至於在《條例草案》審議過程中議員和各界所提出的其他意見，我們在法案委員會上已作出詳細回應，在此就不再費時重複了。

主席，政府深切明白同性伴侶獲法律承認和保障在社會上是具敏感和爭議性的議題。但在終審法院已作出最終裁決的前提下，政府亦遇事不避難，堅決承擔責任，履行法院判定的積極義務。惟在制訂方案和草擬法案過程中，我們亦充分考量了香港的實際情況和各相關因素，並致力取得平衡，一方面保障同性伴侶的合法權益，同時致力維持香港社會和諧穩定，並尊重傳統價值觀念。現法案已獲法案委員會審議，而各位議員亦在剛才的二讀辯論中發表了不同的意見，我懇請各位議員支持通過二讀《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》，以及我稍後動議的修正案。

我謹此陳辭。多謝代主席。"

Raymond（新鴻基地產主席兼董事總經理郭炳聯）、Fred（香港機場管理局主席林天福）、Henry（全國政協常委及西九文化區管理局董事局主席唐英年）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位傳媒：

大家好！今日我很高興並期待已久，因為早前Raymond已跟我預告HKBAC（香港商用航空中心）會有一個新猷，就是擴建大樓，今日終於等到。我剛才也跟Raymond主席說，他的眼光真是很好，時間剛好──現在香港經濟起飛、盛事活動做出很好的成績、世界上也有不同的商務和旅遊人士來香港，能夠目睹HKBAC新大樓竣工，我認為對於香港未來的經濟、旅遊和商業的發展有很大的幫助。

今日來到香港國際機場，一定要幫它再一次「賣告白」，多講也不怕。香港國際機場作為香港的金漆招牌，無可置疑。香港作為國際航空樞紐，無論客運、貨運的成績都一直在世界領先，若套用體育的術語，我們在全能、十項鐵人賽中成績彪炳。HKBAC在整個香港國際航空樞紐的發展裏，我會稱之為是一個最佳球員，Most Valuable Player，即MVP，當之無愧。HKBAC一直在香港國際機場裏打拼，吸引一些高端旅客。在我們整體的航空發展中，不單是客運、貨運，還有航班服務都一直提升。HKBAC連續18年獲商用航空雜誌《Professional Pilot》PRASE意見調查評為亞洲最佳公務機營運基地，是亞洲首屈一指的商務客機中心，值得我們引以為傲。

今日來到HKBAC擴建後的大樓，相信大家都很有印象，讓人感覺耳目一新。不單設計令人感到舒適，亦很實用。這標誌着HKBAC將來拓展更大業務的時候，是一個很重要的里程碑，亦給大家看到打了一支強心針。我期盼藉這個擴建計劃，能吸引更多國際商務客和旅客多來香港及選用HKBAC。

我知道在這個擴建的大樓裏可以享用一站式的服務，包括安檢、海關，還有一些辦公室，或接待傳媒的設施，有一條龍服務，客戶可因應個人需要而選取不同的服務。雖然聽聞收費不菲，但是價錢不是最重要，五星級的服務才是最重要。

說完硬件，軟件都很重要。除擴建大樓外，我知道HKBAC去年已率先提升服務。當客人坐私人飛機來到HKBAC，透過與香港機場管理局的協調和對接，可以轉乘民航客機，將轉機時間大大縮減了多達三分之一。這是相當重要的，因為作為商務客，他們對於私隱、方便會有要求，而時間亦是金錢。這個在軟件方面的提升，正正能幫助不少。

說到吸引旅客，大家可能都會感受得到，不單香港國際機場越來越繁忙，其實在市面上每周都有不同的項目。譬如今日的「一帶一路高峰論壇」，我從灣仔過來，那邊的交通都很繁忙，大家可以想像得到，香港國際機場要接待不同的國際旅客，同樣要用高效和方便的服務去吸引他們。接下來，特區政府銳意舉辦經濟相關的國際會議，以及盛事經濟等。剛才聊天的時候，我很高興得知HKBAC除了能吸引商務旅客，其實都接待了不少國際足球勁旅。在二○二五年上半年，商用航空中心處理超過30班商務航班，當中的商務客是來港處理上市事宜，成績令人鼓舞。

運動方面，香港的足球盛事一浪接一浪。足球勁旅訪港時都會選用HKBAC，配合其出行需要，並且接待傳媒或球迷。希望透過你們這個招牌，幫助我們的盛事經濟，吸引多些類似的體育活動明星來港。

航空方面，本月底會在香港舉辦一個世界航線發展大會2025，屆時將匯聚逾3 000名來自世界各地的航空業領袖及團隊。HKBAC將會發揮一個很重要的關鍵角色，亦可展示香港在這方面所提供的服務。除了這個HKBAC客運大樓，我相信slot（升降時刻）是很重要的。我聽到民航處處長說，正正因為現時三跑道系統已經落成，香港國際機場的整體運力提升了五成。我們暫時都應該還有slot，希望Vivien（香港商用航空中心行政總裁劉敏儀）你們着力吸引更多客人。民航航班數量都一直上升，所以HKBAC要盡快去爭取和不同地方的商務協作，希望可以盡量利用我們現在所增加的一些班次時刻。

今日在活動上見到Fred和Vivian（香港機場管理局行政總裁張李佳蕙），都想和大家宣傳一下機管局的SKYTOPIA，現時正默默招商引資。這個地標正正是一個香港做招商引資的縮影，SKYTOPIA當中的元素就如香港，匯集商務、經濟、文化、旅遊、餐飲、藝術、展覽場地和演唱會。其實在香港能想得到的活動，Fred和Vivian都想好了，最重要是要吸引客人，當中不少是高端客戶，希望這個計劃可以給予大家多一個契機，拓展HKBAC的業務。我們也很希望透過SKYTOPIA，吸引多些內地或國際的旅客來港，促進香港作為內地與國際一個「超級聯繫人」的角色。

最後我衷心期盼HKBAC今日這個里程碑可以幫助我們，帶領香港國際機場的業務蒸蒸日上，繼續把我們這個金漆招牌擦得更光、更亮。多謝大家。"

​立法會主席就《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》會見傳媒的發言（只有中文）,2025-09-10 18:20,2025-09-10 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000726.htm,"下稿代立法會秘書處發出：

以下是立法會主席梁君彥議員今日（九月十日）於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言：

各位傳媒朋友，立法會剛剛審議了《同性伴侶關係登記條例草案》（《條例草案》），法案未獲出席議員過半數贊成，未能通過二讀。就此，我想同大家分享幾點。

《條例草案》源於二○二三年九月五日終審法院在一案中裁定，根據《香港人權法案》第十四條所保障的私生活權利，政府有積極義務立法確立替代框架，讓同性伴侶關係獲得法律承認。政府向立法會提出《條例草案》。

立法會向來支持行政長官和特區政府施政。政府提出《條例草案》時，社會各界已有很多爭論。議員成立了法案委員會，與政府當局舉行了四次會議，認真討論了《條例草案》的政策理念，並細心逐條審議法案條文，正反意見互相交鋒，同時邀請公眾人士提出意見。法案委員會共收到超過一萬份公眾意見書，當中大概超過八成表示反對《條例草案》，而表示支持的意見書只有大約百分之十九。

根據《基本法》，立法會的職權包括制定、修改和廢除法律，以及監察政府工作。無論立法會通過或不通過政府的法案；議員對法案投贊成抑或反對票，只要權力行使得恰當，便符合憲制秩序。

在審議《條例草案》的整個過程中，立法會一直嚴謹、依法履行職責。在今日的會議上，經過大約四小時的充分辯論，議員各抒己見，立法會最終投票否決《條例草案》二讀。這完全符合《基本法》規定，不會影響香港特區憲制秩序。

事實上，《條例草案》涉及極具爭議性的道德議題。香港是一個很開放的社會，但同時仍然是恪守一男一女婚姻制度的社會。今日的投票結果，可說是實際反映了今日香港社會的主流民意和價值觀。

我要強調，立法會一如既往尊重法庭判決、堅守法治原則，但鑑於《條例草案》涉及重大道德議題，立法會議員必須兼顧香港社會的實際情況，包括傳統價值觀、社會整體利益、公眾意見和期望。議員綜合考慮各項因素後，憑良心投票。這正正體現了在行政主導下，行政、立法和司法機關各司其職、互相尊重、互相制衡，而大家都是本着同一理念、同一目標，就是為香港做事、為香港好。

今次《條例草案》雖然未獲通過，但我認為「立法」並不是唯一解決方法。香港是一個很包容的城市，一直都很尊重不同性取向人士的生活方式。立法會期望（與）政府及社會各界繼續坦誠交流，促進共識，為將來有序推動相關議題和解決方案創造更有利的條件。立法會亦會繼續依法支持行政長官和特區政府施政。"

立法會五題：為罕見病復發及惡化的患者提供治療,2025-09-10 17:58,2025-09-10 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000561.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳凱欣議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

據悉醫院管理局（下稱「醫管局」）正參考涵蓋207種罕見病的國家罕見病目錄，建立罕見病資料庫，以便識別有關患者和檢索應診紀錄。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）是否知悉，根據醫管局罕見病資料庫定義，過去五年每年公立醫院急症室的罕見病患者求診宗數；當中有多少宗屬病情復發或惡化個案，以及該等個案所涉及的患者人數和當中求診次數最多的五種罕見病為何；有否統計該等患者由抵達急症室至接受治療的最長和中位數時間為何；

（二）是否知悉，醫管局醫護人員如何利用罕見病資料庫，在臨床應用層面協助診治罕見病患者，尤其是該等因病情復發或惡化而於非預約時間求診的患者；及

（三）鑑於一些復發率高的罕見病（例如視神經脊髓炎），若無適時用藥會造成不可逆轉的損傷，政府是否知悉，醫管局會否就該等罕見病成立跨專科專家小組，定期檢討治療方案及急症室處理有關病人的流程，並制訂相關臨床指引和黃金治療時間，以加快對該等病人的診治？

答覆：

主席：

就陳凱欣議員的提問，經諮詢醫管局（醫院管理局）後，現綜合回覆如下：

醫管局很重視為所有病人（包括罕見病患者）提供適切的治療。

國際間對於罕見疾病並沒有一致的定義。為強化對罕見病患者的臨床支援及提升診斷治療的能力，醫管局參考涵蓋207種罕見病的國家罕見病目錄，建立罕見病資料庫。醫管局臨床醫療管理系統備存所有病人（包括罕見病患者）的臨床數據和不同疾病類別的資料，醫生會在為目錄內涵蓋的罕見病患者提供治療時，於臨床醫療管理系統的應診紀錄中輸入相關診斷編碼，以識別罕見病患者，並相應提供適切治療。隨着醫管局累積更多治療罕見病的本地經驗及臨床數據，臨床醫療管理系統內罕見病患者的資料庫將得以擴充，為醫療服務規劃和臨床診斷治療提供很重要的參考。截至今年六月三十日，醫管局臨床醫療管理系統已全數收錄了國家罕見病目錄中所涵蓋的207種罕見病，總個案數目約為63 600宗。

根據醫管局的統計數字，全港一些較不罕見的五類罕見病患者依次為：胃腸間質瘤、全身型重症肌無力、早產兒視網膜病、遺傳性低鎂血症及真性紅血球增多症。當中大部分罕見病患者確診後都可在門診跟進，只有少數患者需要入院接受治療。病人若因病情需要前往急症室求診，醫護人員會根據其臨床情況提供適切的治療。

應對罕見病方面的主要挑戰在於病例很少，令診斷和治療比較困難。罕見病的症狀很多時候並不典型及缺乏一些特定性，亦往往與常見不適很相似，同時有機會影響多個器官系統，導致患者在不同的專科診室之間求診，未能全面了解疾病的狀況。除臨床檢查外，確診亦可能需要一些高技術的測試，例如基因檢測，延長診斷過程。

針對遺傳性罕見病，例如成骨不全症及性聯遺傳型低磷酸鹽症，配合基因組醫學在香港的最新發展，醫管局的醫學遺傳服務為遺傳病（包括罕見病）患者及其家庭提供一站式的跨專業支援。患有或懷疑受各種遺傳病及其他罕見病影響的病人及其家庭會獲轉介至香港兒童醫院醫學遺傳科，接受評估、檢驗、診斷、治療、輔導，以及預防的一站式服務。本着「全人醫治」的宗旨，醫管局透過跨專業及跨部門團隊，包括醫生、護士、藥劑師、臨床心理學家、康復專科護士、物理治療師、營養師、職業治療師、語言治療師、義肢矯形師和醫務社工等，以綜合服務模式為罕見病患者提供全人醫療和復康服務。

此外，香港基因組中心自二○二一年開始展開香港基因組計劃，在公立醫院招募合資格病人及其家屬自願參與全基因組測序，涵蓋個別與基因組學及精準醫學有關的罕見病，如黏多醣症、馬凡氏綜合症等。測序結果有助精準診斷，並為預後評估及治療決策提供關鍵依據。政府未來會繼續推進落實二○二四年《施政報告》中的措施，發展精準醫療。

就題述的視神經脊髓炎（Neuromyelitis Optica），該疾病是一種極為罕見的自身免疫疾病。患者的免疫系統會攻擊自己的視神經和脊髓，造成視神經炎和脊髓炎的損傷，因此，患者一般由眼科醫生或腦神經科醫生診治，並視乎需要作出會診，及安排有關檢查。

有關病人如因病情復發，出現病徵，而須到急症室求診，會於現行的急症室分流制度下由分流護士進行評估及分流，並且根據病情的嚴重程度，決定治理的先後次序。醫管局的服務目標訂明，所有危殆的病人（即一類）會即時得到診治，即百分之一百獲即時診治。而危急及緊急，即二類和三類的病人，在抵達急症室後亦會得到優先治理，目標是絕大部分的危急病人和緊急病人分別會在15分鐘或30分鐘內獲處理。一般而言，病人若出現急性視力下降或局部神經障礙的症狀，將被分流為緊急，即是三類類別。急症室的目標是安排緊急類別的病人於30分鐘內接受診治。如病人有臨床需要，急症室會安排眼科跟進，由眼科專科醫生即時評估情況，作出臨床檢查、抽血，以及電腦掃描等檢查，以排除其他有可能導致相關病徵的情況。病人經評估後，會按病情需要，作住院或轉介到相關專科門診治療及跟進。多謝主席。"
LCQ5: Providing treatment for patients experiencing relapses or deterioration of rare diseases,2025-09-10 17:58,2025-09-10 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000562.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It is learnt that the Hospital Authority (HA) is developing the Rare Diseases Database by referencing the Mainland's National Lists of Rare Diseases which contains 207 rare disease entries, with a view to facilitating the identification of the relevant patients and retrieval of their clinical records. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it knows, according to the definitions under HA's Rare Diseases Database, the number of cases in which rare disease patients attend the accident and emergency (A&E) departments of public hospitals for treatment in each of the past five years, and among those cases, the number involving relapses or deterioration of the diseases and the number of patients concerned, as well as the top five rare diseases with the highest number of attendances; whether it has compiled statistics on the longest and median time taken from patients arriving at the A&E departments to receiving treatment;

(2) whether it knows how HA's healthcare staff make use of the Rare Diseases Database to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of rare disease patients in terms of clinical applications, in particular those patients seeking treatment without scheduled appointments due to relapses or deterioration of the diseases; and

(3) given that irreversible damage could be caused to patients suffering from certain rare diseases with high relapse rates (such as neuromyelitis optica) if timely medical treatment is not administered, whether the Government knows if HA will set up a multi-specialty expert panel in respect of such rare diseases to regularly review treatment protocols and the procedures for handling the patients concerned by the A&E departments, as well as to formulate the relevant clinical guidelines and define the golden hours for treatment so as to expedite diagnosis and treatment for such patients?

Reply:

President,

  In consultation with the Hospital Authority (HA), the consolidated reply to the question raised by the Hon Chan Hoi-yan is as follows:

  The HA attaches high importance to providing optimal care for all patients, including those with rare diseases.

  There is no common definition of rare diseases worldwide. To enhance clinical support for patients with rare diseases and improve diagnostic and treatment capabilities, the HA has developed the Rare Diseases Database by referencing the National Lists of Rare Diseases which contains 207 rare disease entities. The HA's Clinical Management System (CMS) maintains clinical data for all patients, including those with rare diseases, alongside information on various disease categories. When providing treatment for patients with rare diseases covered under the lists, doctors will input the relevant diagnosis codes in the consultation records in the HA's CMS to identify patients with rare diseases and provide appropriate care accordingly. As the HA accumulates more local experience in treating rare diseases and clinical data, the database of rare disease patients in the CMS will become more extensive, providing important reference for healthcare service planning as well as clinical diagnosis and treatment. As at June 30 this year, the HA's CMS has recorded all 207 diseases listed in the National Lists of Rare Diseases, with a total of about 63 600 cases.

  According to statistics from the HA, the five types of rare diseases that are relatively less uncommon in Hong Kong are, in order of prevalence: gastrointestinal stromal tumor, generalised myasthenia gravis, retinopathy of prematurity, hereditary hypomagnesemia, and polycythemia vera. After diagnosis, most of these rare disease patients can be managed through out-patient follow-ups, with only a small number requiring hospitalisation for treatment. Where patients are required to attend the accident and emergency (A&E) department due to medical needs, healthcare staff will provide appropriate treatment based on their clinical conditions.

  The primary challenge in dealing with rare diseases lies in the small number of cases, resulting in difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. Symptoms of rare diseases are often atypical and non-specific, frequently resembling common ailments. Additionally, these symptoms may affect multiple organ systems, leading patients to consult various medical specialties without obtaining a comprehensive understanding of their condition. Apart from clinical examinations, diagnosis may also require some high technology testings, such as genetic testings, thereby prolonging the diagnostic process.

  For hereditary rare diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta and X-linked hypophosphataemia, the clinical genetics service of the HA provides one-stop cross-disciplinary support for patients with genetic disorders (including rare diseases) and their families, in line with the latest developments in genomic medicine in Hong Kong. Patients who are affected or suspected to be affected by various genetic diseases and other rare diseases as well as their families will be referred to the Department of Clinical Genetics of Hong Kong Children's Hospital for one-stop services, including assessment, testing, diagnosis, treatment, counselling and prevention services. Adhering to the principle of ""providing holistic care for patients"", the HA adopts an integrated service model in providing holistic medical and rehabilitation services to patients with rare diseases through multi-disciplinary and inter-departmental teams, comprising doctors, nurses, pharmacists, clinical psychologists, rehabilitation specialty nurses, physiotherapists, dietitians, occupational therapists, speech therapists, prosthetist-orthotists, medical social workers, etc.

  In addition, the Hong Kong Genome Institute launched the Hong Kong Genome Project since 2021, covering rare diseases associated with genomics and precision medicine, such as mucopolysaccharidosis and Marfan syndrome. Eligible patients and their family members are recruited through public hospitals to undergo whole genome sequencing on a voluntary basis. The sequencing results assist precise diagnoses and provide key basis for prognosis assessment and treatment decisions. The Government will continue to advance the implementation of the initiative under the 2024 Policy Address in developing precision medicine.

  Regarding Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO) as mentioned in the question, it is an extremely rare autoimmune disorder in which the immune system of the patient attacks his/her own optic nerves and spinal cord, causing damages to optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. As a result, patients are typically managed by ophthalmologists or neurologists. Joint consultations will be arranged as needed, along with relevant investigations.

  In cases where these patients need to attend the A&E department due to relapses and presentation of symptoms, they will undergo assessment and triage by nurses under the prevailing triage system at the A&E department. The treatment priority is determined based on the severity of their condition. The HA's service targets stipulate that all critical patients (Triage 1) are to receive immediate treatment (i.e. 100 per cent immediate treatment), while emergency (Triage 2) patients and urgent (Triage 3) patients will be prioritised for treatment upon arrival at the A&E department, the targets being that most of the emergency and urgent patients are to be treated within 15 minutes and 30 minutes respectively. Generally speaking, patients experiencing symptoms such as acute vision loss or focal neurological deficits will be triaged as urgent cases (i.e. Triage 3). The A&E department aims to arrange these urgent patients for treatment within 30 minutes. In case the patient concerned has clinical needs, the A&E department will refer him/her to the Department of Ophthalmology for follow-up. The ophthalmology specialist will forthwith assess the condition of the patient and conduct clinical examinations, blood tests and computerised tomography (CT) scans etc, to rule out other conditions that may cause the relevant symptoms. After assessment, patients may be arranged for hospitalisation or referred to the relevant specialist out-patient clinics for treatment and follow-up subject to their conditions. Thank you, President."
SFST's keynote speech at Forum on Sustainability Disclosures (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 17:42,2025-09-10 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000625.htm,"  Following is the keynote speech by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the Forum on Sustainability Disclosures today (September 10):

Kelvin (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Dr Kelvin Wong), Julia (Chief Executive Officer of the Securities and Futures Commission, Ms Julia Leung), Emmanuel (Chief Executive Officer of the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority, Mr Emmanuel Givanakis), Mark (Chief Executive of the Dubai Financial Services Authority, Mr Mark Steward), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to join you all at the Forum on Sustainability Disclosures today to exchange views on this topic with growing importance globally. First of all, I would like to thank the Securities and Futures Commission, our co-organiser of today's event, and the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), our event partner, for joining hands with our bureau (Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau) to promote the development of a comprehensive sustainability disclosure ecosystem in Hong Kong. Today's Forum is one of the fruits of our joint effort, providing a platform for vibrant exchanges of expertise, ideas and global collaboration to foster sustainability disclosures in the global capital market. Also, amid the current complicated geopolitical environment, we are also here to reaffirm our commitment in driving the sustainability agenda together with our partners.

  Having accurate, comparable and consistent information on sustainability-related topics, as highlighted by Kelvin just now, is vital for making informed decisions, evaluating climate-related risks, and fostering innovation in sustainable financing. This is why sustainability disclosures are attracting fast-growing global awareness. Today we will explore together the path ahead for the global and local adoption of the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) - Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB Standards). We will also discuss how disclosures can drive significant progress in sustainability development and facilitating financing and investments for real economy transition, climate adaption and mitigation in Hong Kong, the region, and beyond.

  Hong Kong is a leading international financial centre and a hub for green and sustainable finance. Last year, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to around US$43 billion, capturing around 45 per cent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018. Besides, as of June 2025, the number of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds authorised by the SFC was over 200 with assets under management reaching HK$1.1 trillion and more. The number of ESG funds and assets under management recorded an increase of 51 per cent and 18 per cent respectively from three years ago. At the same time, we are committed to enhancing our competitiveness by adhering to the international standards and best practices, and have taken big steps in achieving this goal.

Sustainability disclosures

  Following the release of the first set of the ISSB Standards back in 2023, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government published a vision statement in March last year, outlining our vision and approach in building a comprehensive ecosystem for sustainability disclosure in Hong Kong. Since then, listed companies, financial institutions, investors and industry organisations have been engaged in the consultation to identify Hong Kong-specific circumstances that should be taken into account when developing the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards (Hong Kong Standards) which is in full alignment with the ISSB Standards. We are happy that the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), as the sustainability reporting standard setter in Hong Kong, published last December the Hong Kong Standards, which are fully aligned with the ISSB Standards.

  After the release of our vision statement, we continued to work closely with financial regulators and stakeholders in ironing out the steps and timeline for Hong Kong's full adoption of the ISSB Standards. We launched in December last year the Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong, detailing the approach to require publicly accountable entities (PAEs) to adopt the ISSB Standards. This roadmap provides a clear pathway for large PAEs to adopt fully the ISSB Standards no later than 2028.

  Since the launch of the Roadmap, we have made progressive moves towards our target. For listed issuers, the HKEX has implemented in phases since January this year new climate-related disclosures requirements under its Listing Rules (New Climate Requirements), which are developed based on IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures. The New Climate Requirements aim to prepare companies to start climate reporting early in accordance with provisions of the ISSB Standards. The HKEX will consult the market in 2027 on mandating sustainability reporting against the Hong Kong Standards for listed PAEs, with an expected effective date of January 2028 under a proportionate approach. For the financial industry, our financial regulators will conduct sector-specific engagements to determine the approach and timing of adopting the Hong Kong Standards for different financial sectors. Subject to stakeholders' comments and feedback, relevant financial regulators will require non-listed financial institutions carrying a significant weight (i.e. non-listed PAEs) to apply the Hong Kong Standards no later than 2028.

  We are proud that the IFRS Foundation, in its publication of the jurisdictional profiles on adoption of the ISSB Standards this June, confirms Hong Kong as among the initial set of jurisdictions having set a target of fully adopting the ISSB Standards. This underscores our commitment to enhancing the transparency of information on sustainable development in the capital markets, enabling investors to make informed investment decisions and promoting global capital flows.

  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the ISSB for its support and continuous engagements with relevant stakeholders in Hong Kong during our journey on the full adoption of ISSB Standards.

Sustainability assurance

  To support smooth and practical implementation of sustainability disclosure requirements, a comprehensive and robust ecosystem encompassing aspects such as sustainability assurance, data and technology, as well as skills and competencies is vital. For sustainability assurance, the HKICPA issued in March this year the Hong Kong Standard on Sustainability Assurance 5000 which fully converges with the International Standard on Sustainability Assurance 5000 published by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. It will develop the local ethics standards for sustainability assurance, which will be on a full convergence basis with the International Ethics Standards for Sustainability Assurance published by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, for publication within this year. The Accounting and Financial Reporting Council is also working with relevant financial regulators and stakeholders with a view to releasing a proposed local regulatory framework for sustainability assurance for public consultation within this year.

Data and technology

  Promoting data and technology is one of our key priorities to promote the availability and accessibility of sustainability-related information. We have launched a number of tools to support enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in sustainability reporting. For example, a Climate and Environmental Risk Questionnaire for non-listed companies/SMEs was launched three years ago to provide a free and easy-to-use sustainability reporting template to corporates in need, facilitating their understanding of their sustainability performance and raising their sustainability profiles to lenders, investors and supply chain clients. We are now enhancing the Questionnaire to make it more accessible and inclusive.

  Another example is the greenhouse gas emissions calculation and estimation tools we launched in February last year. The tools are free for public use and aim to help corporations manage their environmental footprint while encouraging market participants to improve their sustainable development practices. The tools also clearly disclose the methodology and data sources, and incorporate Hong Kong and Mainland elements into the calculation and estimation models. Going forward, we will continue to enhance the tools and collaborate with different stakeholders to facilitating better sustainability disclosures with the use of these tools.

Skills and competencies

  Last but not least, we are committed to strengthening capacity building to assist the industry and companies in their journey towards sustainability disclosures. The HKSAR Government will continue to support industry capacity building through our Pilot Green and Sustainable Finance Capacity Building Support Scheme launched three years ago, and the Scheme will be extended to 2028. Besides, financial regulators, the HKEX and the HKICPA, have been organising conferences, seminars and other stakeholder exchange activities to promote alignment with the ISSB Standards and support capacity building efforts locally, regionally and internationally. These engagement activities and relevant training programmes help to nurture skilled sustainable finance professionals including preparers, reporting and assurance professionals, and sustainability-related service providers.

  By collaborating and working together, we can definitely build a sustainable and resilient future. Before I wish all of you a fruitful day, normally these days, forums can't finish without mentioning AI. Just before I came to this stage, I checked on my app in terms of what word it would use to describe Hong Kong and also sustainability disclosure. There are a number of choices, of course it depends on which app you use and also what time of the day that you use it. One of the key words is actually ""ecosystem"".

  I think the app describes what I just described, basically it's about who to provide, what to provide and how to provide the information. I'm sure in the coming days and also this forum, you will be having a lot of insightful discussions and exchanges, in particular how Hong Kong can be a better ecosystem on sustainability disclosures for not just Hong Kong but also for the region and the world. Thank you."
醫務衞生局局長會見傳媒談流感疫苗（只有中文）,2025-09-10 17:34,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000644.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十日）出席立法會會議後會見傳媒的談話內容：

記者：（有關政府採購流感疫苗時的考慮）另外，政府有「先入先出」原則，但對於一些學校學生來說，家長不能選擇疫苗的品牌，會否擔心家長會選擇到私營機構打針，或者索性不安排小朋友打針，會否擔心令流感爆發﹖

醫務衞生局局長：滅活疫苗在全球已使用超過50年，是一個非常成熟的疫苗技術。在新冠疫情期間，我們都知道滅活疫苗，特別是科興疫苗，在香港廣泛應用達900萬劑，足以證明其質量安全和效力，這對抗疫非常重要。我們在考慮疫苗的註冊時，一貫採用非常高的標準，根據其質量安全，以及效能，並根據藥廠提供的數據作註冊，所以所有符合審批註冊標準的，我們都會列入考慮方案中。關於疫苗採購，我們一直都堅持多元化，因為疫苗的供應，特別是季節性流感，其供應會受到許多因素影響。我們為了要確保這些疫苗的供應不會受到某些因素影響，必須多元化，從不同的途徑去採購疫苗，整個過程都是根據最高標準。

科興疫苗方面，它確實是沒有一些有關孕婦應用的臨床研究數據，但是不表示孕婦不適合用，科興疫苗沒有對孕婦列為禁忌症，故此，是可以使用的。不過，因為它沒有針對孕婦而做的臨床數據，雖然滅活疫苗本身對孕婦是安全的，對嬰兒亦沒有影響，但在藥廠提供的指引中，就列出應與醫生商量以作判斷和風險評估後才採用。

至於本港，每年流感疫苗，例如上年接種超過200萬劑。孕婦方面，我們計算大概每年有6 000名孕婦接種流感疫苗，佔總數量比較少。如果孕婦與醫生評估後，決定不用科興疫苗，她亦可以選擇其他的一些選擇。我們採購的賽諾菲三價滅活疫苗，都是滅活疫苗，不過是三價，有孕婦使用的臨床數據，所以她們可以使用的。賽諾菲三價滅活疫苗我們購買超過90萬劑，對於那幾千名孕婦的需求，是絕對沒有問題的。

至於在學校的疫苗接種方面，我一定要強調，所有我們現在採購的兩種滅活疫苗，都是安全的，亦是適合給所有的市民使用，包括兒童。在對抗流感方面，大家都很清晰，最近很不幸有幾宗嚴重個案，我們對抗流感必須做好準備工作，而流感疫苗接種是最重要的一環。我在此重申，兒童、他們的家長，最重要是要接種流感疫苗。學校外展計劃可以提供噴鼻式疫苗，也可以混合，某些同學希望用噴鼻式，亦有一些用注射的滅活疫苗，都可以給他們一個選擇。如果有些非常少數的學校不參與外展，家長亦可以選擇到私營醫療診所接受接種。"

李家超歡迎孫占托率團來港，出席第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」和擔任演講嘉賓。李家超說，特區政府積極開拓東南亞國家聯盟和「一帶一路」國家等新興市場；柬埔寨市場發展迅速、經濟潛力龐大，兩地合作空間廣闊。香港與柬埔寨去年共達成13份合作備忘錄，涵蓋經貿、航空和金融服務等範疇，他很高興今日論壇上見證雙方政府部門達成更多合作備忘錄，進一步加強雙方交流合作。

李家超表示，柬埔寨是國家推動「一帶一路」的戰略夥伴；香港擁有高度國際化、市場化和便利的營商環境，具有資金、技術和市場資源的優勢，會充分發揮「一帶一路」功能平台角色，與柬埔寨共同抓緊「一帶一路」機遇，促進兩地經貿發展，互惠共贏。他歡迎柬埔寨企業善用香港的「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，開拓海外和內地市場。

李家超感謝柬埔寨支持建立國際調解院。他表示，國際調解院總部設於香港，展現香港在國際調解方面的獨特優勢和實力，進一步促進香港的國際交往合作。香港會繼續發揮背靠祖國、聯通世界的優勢，為推動共建「一帶一路」貢獻力量。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-10 17:30,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000620.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月十日）下午五時，中心錄得一宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案。

最新個案資料

新增個案涉及一名居於深水埗區的五歲男童，他於七月十五日至八月三十一日與家人到訪廣東省鶴山市和鄰近的佛山市。病人於九月五日出現發燒、九月七日出現皮疹，翌日到明愛醫院急症室求診，獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。他的三名家居接觸者（包括兩名一同到鶴山市的人士）現時沒有出現病徵，並正接受醫學監察。

由於病人於潛伏期身處鶴山市，中心認為他是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得14宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案（八宗來自廣東省、四宗孟加拉國、一宗印度尼西亞及一宗斯里蘭卡）。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三十一日至九月六日）廣東省新增178宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-10 17:30,2025-09-10 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000616.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 10), onenew imported case of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

 The new case involves a five-year-old boy living in Sham Shui Po District. He visited Heshan City and the neighboring Foshan City in Guangdong Province with his family between July 15 and August 31. The patient developed a fever on September 5 and a rash on September 7. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Centre the next day and was admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. He is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. His three household contacts, including two persons who travelled to Heshan with the boy,are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the patient stayed in Heshan during the incubation period, the CHP considered that he was infected during travel. The case was classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the case to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 14 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases (eight from Guangdong Province, four from Bangladesh, one from Indonesia and one from Sri Lanka). From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Also attending the meeting was the Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong.

ããMr Lee welcomed Mr Sun and his delegation to Hong Kong to attend the 10th Belt and Road Summit and to serve as a keynote speaker. Noting that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government is actively exploring emerging markets in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Belt and Road countries, Mr Lee said that Cambodia, with its rapid market development and vast economic potential, offers broad opportunities for co-operation between the two places. Hong Kong and Cambodia reached 13 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) last year, covering areas such as economics and trade, aviation, and financial services. Mr Lee said he was pleased to witness more MOUs between government departments of the two places at today's Summit, which will further enhance bilateral exchanges and co-operation.

ããMr Lee said that Cambodia is a strategic partner in the country's promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative, while Hong Kong possesses a highly internationalised, market-oriented and business-friendly environment with strengths in capital, technology and market resources that enable it to fully serve as a functional platform to help both places seize the opportunities from the Belt and Road Initiative, fostering economic and trade development and achieving mutual benefits and win-win outcomes. He welcomed enterprises from Cambodia to leverage Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" to explore overseas and Mainland markets.

ããMr Lee thanked Cambodia for its support in establishing the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed). He said that the establishment of the IOMed headquarters in Hong Kong demonstrates the city's unique advantages and strengths in international mediation to further promote international exchanges and co-operation. Hong Kong will continue to leverage its advantages of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world, thereby contributing to the promotion of the development of the Belt and Road Initiative."
立法會：運輸及物流局局長動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》發言全文（只有中文）,2025-09-10 17:28,2025-09-10 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000639.htm,"​以下是運輸及物流局局長陳美寶今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》的發言全文：

主席：

我謹動議二讀《2025年道路交通（修訂）（網約車服務）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。

隨着科技進步和出行模式改變，透過網絡預約個人化點對點交通服務在世界各地已相當普及，香港作為一個國際大都會，情況亦不例外。今屆特區政府抱着破局的決心，引入清晰的法律框架規管網約車服務解決這個多年的爭議。政府提出的規管框架，將市民利益放在首位，目標是讓市民有更多安全、合法合規和多元化的出行選擇。同時，我們亦會兼顧司機的生意，吸引新血入行，促進點對點行業的健康和有序發展，希望為行業帶來全新景象。

網約車的議題複雜，牽涉多方面的因素和不同持份者，各界就着規管細節意見紛陳。不過，不論是市民、的士業界，還是網約車平台公司，他們都有一個非常清晰明確的共識，就是政府應該早日規管網約車服務，一方面保障乘客安全，滿足市民的出行需要，另一方面也為整體個人化點對點交通服務締造一個良性的競爭環境。

我們就有關議題在今年七月諮詢立法會交通事務委員會時，議員一致支持政府就提供網約車服務的平台、車輛及司機作出規管，亦同時支持政府全速推進立法工作，以期能夠讓規管制度早日「落地」，回應社會各界的訴求。在此，我衷心感謝各個議員的支持，以及他們就規管框架所提出的寶貴意見。

在過去一段時間，我們一直密鑼緊鼓籌劃規管框架和草擬有關法律條文，並繼續虛心聆聽各界意見，理性務實調整立法建議，希望有關規管框架在保障市民出行安全的同時，亦能鼓勵行業發展。今日，我向立法會提交《條例草案》，踏出立法方案的第一步，透過修訂《道路交通條例》，先就規管框架確立原則性的事宜，並為下一階段的工作提供法律基礎。我們會在下一屆立法會會期開展後，透過附屬法例進一步訂定規管的技術細節。視乎立法和其他準備工作的進度，我期望首批持牌的網約車平台可於二○二六年第四季內開始營運。

為了保障乘客的出行安全和權益，我們在《條例草案》中要求提供網約車服務的平台、私家車和司機三方都需要領有合適的牌證。日後，合法的網約車服務必須符合三大條件，包括（1）通過持牌平台預約和安排；（2）提供服務的私家車領有網約車車輛許可證；以及（3）駕駛有關車輛的司機領有網約車車輛駕駛許可證。違反上述條件提供網約車服務屬於非法載客取酬，須負上刑責。

在建議的規管框架下，任何提供網約車平台服務的電子或電訊平台都需要領取網約車服務牌照。持牌平台必須為在香港註冊的公司，並符合指定的入場門檻，包括在營運經驗、財力證明、資本投入、董事資格等各方面，以確保持牌平台具備足夠的營運能力提供優質的網約車服務。

持牌平台須維持適當且具效率的服務，並對旗下車輛和司機進行盡職審查，確保他們領有合適的許可證。此外，平台亦須並備存妥善的營運紀錄並向運輸署署長提交。運輸署會監察平台的營運，並就牌照施加條件。如果日後平台違反牌照條件或法定要求，視乎嚴重程度，運輸署署長可以施加罰款，更改或暫時吊銷牌照，甚至取消牌照。

提供網約車服務的私家車必須持有車輛許可證，並購買合適的第三者風險保險；在申請或每年續領許可證時，車齡須低於12年並符合有關驗車的要求。此外，車輛須由個人名義登記並只能由登記車主提供服務，在營運時亦須按規定展示標識以供識別。「人車綁定」的安排有助吸引真正有意提供有質素網約車服務的人士加入行業，亦避免衍生網約車租賃市場，令車輛許可證淪為具炒賣價值的資產或出現黑工司機的情況。

至於司機方面，司機須領有網約車車輛駕駛許可證才可提供網約車服務，並須符合指定的條件，包括年滿21歲、持有香港永久性居民身份證、五年內沒有嚴重交通定罪紀錄，並完成指定考核等。

我們建議將來申請的士及網約車駕駛資格的人士可參與同一個簡化的筆試，而已持有的士駕駛執照的人士，可無須再次考試便可向運輸署申請駕駛許可證。當然日後考的士執照的人士，參與筆試後，他們亦可以申請駕駛網約車，並領取網約車司機許可證。有關措施可有助改善司機短缺以及老化的情況，壯大香港現時的司機供應、吸引新血入行，最重要是推動整個點對點行業的持續發展。

上述各項的牌證要求既可保障乘客安全和利益，亦有助提升和締造良性競爭的環境，讓的士和網約車發揮各自的優勢，為市民提供優質服務。的士與網約車絕對不是零和博弈，而是共存互補。在引入規範化的網約車後，的士獨特和固有的優勢，包括他們可以在街上截乘乘客、可使用遍布全港各區的的士站、禁區上落客等，這些一一的優勢以及獨特性將維持不變；而網約車亦可透過共享經濟的模式釋放閒置運力，為市民提供更多元化的選擇。我們相信透過引入規管制度，可達致的士、網約車、市民多方共贏。

在考慮車輛許可證的數目時，我們必須顧及香港獨特的實際情況。香港城市發展密度高，每日有接近九成市民使用高效的公交系統出行，如果無限制地發出車輛許可證很可能會引發負面效果，例如交通擠塞，影響公交系統生態；或導致市場惡性競爭，令整體司機生意和行業發展受到影響。因此，政府有需要對網約車的數目實施總量控制，並會在下一階段透過附屬法例訂明有關數目。在訂定限額時，我們會小心審慎地考慮多個因素，包括市民的召車經驗、平台營運需要，公共交通系統生態，以及道路承載力等。

引入網約車規管制度有助大幅提升對乘客的保障。不過，考慮到可能仍有少數不法分子以私家車非法取酬載客，《條例草案》除了是就我剛才所說，對平台車輛以及司機都有作出明確的規管以及罰則外，我們藉着今次的《條例草案》亦加強罰則，以更有效打擊「白牌車」，保障乘客和合法合規的個人化點對點交通服務。根據現時法例，因非法取酬載客而被定罪的司機可被處監禁和罰款，亦可被停牌一段時間。為加強阻嚇力，《條例草案》訂明停牌時間須不少於12個月，並可長達三年。《條例草案》亦訂明若持牌平台安排沒有持有許可證的車輛或司機提供網約車服務，除了相關車主和司機可被處監禁和罰款外，持牌平台亦須負上刑責。

另外，根據現行法例，當司機因非法取酬載客被定罪後，運輸署可暫時吊銷涉事車輛的牌照，並扣押有關車輛一段期間。我們會藉着這次修改主體法例時引入這條《條例草案》內，建議強化暫時吊銷相關車輛牌照及扣押車輛的安排：當車輛涉嫌干犯非法取酬載客的罪行時，就算未能識辨涉事司機而作出刑事檢控，仍有機制暫時吊銷車輛牌照和扣押車輛。政府正敲定具體程序的細節，並積極進行相關的法律草擬工作。

主席，政府在推動網約車服務的規管框架時，一直秉持「以民為本、良性競爭、共存互補」的宗旨。我相信引入規管制度可有助重塑在香港個人化點對點公共交通服務，讓服務邁向現代化、司機年輕化和市民選擇多元化。政府會全力配合立法會的審議工作，我亦理解有關的立法工作相當緊迫和緊湊，我在此承諾我以及我的團隊會全力配合，並以高效回覆各議員以及在法案委員會提出的提問，我在此懇請議員支持《條例草案》，讓《條例草案》可趕及在今屆立法會會期完結前通過。

主席，我謹此陳辭。"

Immigration Department arrests 11 persons during operations targeting foreign domestic helpers who breach conditions of stay (with photo),2025-09-10 17:17,2025-09-10 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000635.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations codenamed ""Swordfish"", for five consecutive days from September 5 to 9, targeting foreign domestic helpers who breached their conditions of stay. A total of 11 persons, including six suspected illegal workers and five suspected employers, were arrested.

  During the operation, ImmD investigators raided 28 target locations including restaurants, bars and commercial and residential buildings. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised six women, aged 23 to 48. Among them, two persons were current helpers, two persons were overstaying ex-helpers, and two persons were found to be holders of recognisance forms, which prohibit them from taking any employment in Hong Kong. ImmD investigators found most of the suspected illegal workers at restaurants performing dishwashing, cleaning, etc. Meanwhile, five suspected employers, comprising two men and three women, aged 29 to 50, were in charge of the involved companies or restaurants and suspected of employing the suspected illegal workers.

  ""A helper should only perform domestic duties for the employer specified in the contract. The helper should not take up any other employment, including part-time domestic duties, with any other person. The employer should not require or allow the helper to carry out any work for any other person,"" an ImmD spokesman said.

  The spokesman also said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him/her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  In addition, the spokesman warned that, ""As stipulated in section 38AA of the Immigration Ordinance, an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land is prohibited from taking any employment, whether paid or unpaid, or establishing or joining any business. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to three years' imprisonment.""

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation. Identified TIP victims will be provided with various forms of support and assistance, including urgent intervention, medical services, counselling, shelter, temporary accommodation and other supporting services. The ImmD calls on TIP victims to report crimes to the relevant departments immediately."
入境處打擊外傭違反逗留條件　共拘十一人（附圖）,2025-09-10 17:17,2025-09-10 17:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000634.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於九月五日至昨日（九月九日）一連五日在全港各區展開代號「劍魚」的反非法勞工行動。在該項打擊外籍家庭傭工（外傭）在港違反逗留條件的行動中，入境處共拘捕11名人士，包括六名懷疑非法勞工及五名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的人士。
​
行動中，入境處人員一共搜查了28個目標地點，包括酒樓、餐廳、酒吧、商業大廈及住宅單位等。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為六名女子，年齡介乎二十三至四十八歲。當中兩名為現職外傭、兩名為逾期逗留的前外傭、以及兩名為持有不允許僱傭工作的擔保書（俗稱「行街紙」）人士。被捕的非法勞工主要在食肆從事洗碗及清潔等工作。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的五名人士為兩男三女，年齡介乎二十九至五十歲，他們均為涉案公司或餐廳的相關負責人。
​
入境處發言人說：「外傭只可以為合約上訂明的僱主料理家務。外傭不得受僱於其他人士擔任任何職務，包括兼職家務工作。僱主亦不得要求或容許傭工為其他人士擔任任何工作。」
​
入境處發言人強調：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆他人違反逗留條件者同罪。」
​
此外，入境處發言人警告：「根據《入境條例》第38AA條，非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒絕入境人士不得接受有薪或無薪的僱傭工作，開辦或參與任何業務。違者一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五萬元及監禁三年。」
​
發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰會由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。
​
根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。
​
入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外傭）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。"

立法會二十二題：長者健康中心,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000532.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳振英議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的書面答覆︰

問題：

衞生署在全港設有18間長者健康中心，65歲或以上的長者可申請成為會員，但據悉目前輪候成為新會員時間較長，截至今年六月，該18間中心仍在處理二○二三年或更早期遞交的申請。另一方面，為減少服務重疊，基層醫療署計劃將長者健康中心的服務分階段整合至各區的地區康健中心。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年，每年各區長者健康中心的以下資料：接獲的會員申請宗數、新增會員及總會員人數、申請成為會員的平均輪候時間，以及健康檢查、治療、注射及敷藥等主要服務的平均輪候時間；

（二）有否檢視長者健康中心處理會員申請需時甚長的原因為何；有否採取措施以提升處理會員申請的速度及效率；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）整合長者健康中心的服務至地區康健中心的時間表及過渡安排為何？

答覆：

主席：

為提升市民健康，改善醫療保障及質量，發揮醫療專業優勢，《行政長官2024年施政報告》提出，政府會全面審視醫療體系的定位和目標，改革衞生署、醫院管理局（醫管局）和基層醫療署的職能和分工，強化基層醫療，促進健康和疾病預防。衞生署會逐步把其專科和基層醫療服務分別轉移至醫管局和基層醫療署，以集中資源強化其規管事務和衞生防護等。其中，基層醫療署會分階段為整合衞生署轄下的長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡作準備，以加強服務協同效應，按長者需要作適切安排。

就陳振英議員的提問，經諮詢衞生署後，本局現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）現時，衞生署在全港18區每區均設有一間長者健康中心，為年滿65歲的人士以家庭醫學模式提供綜合基層健康服務，包括健康評估、健康輔導、健康教育和診療服務。凡年滿65歲的人士均可到任何一間長者健康中心申請成為長者健康中心的會員。

另一方面，政府已於二○二二年在全港18區設立地區康健中心或地區康健站（以下統稱為地區康健中心）。現時，地區康健中心向所有市民（包括長者）提供健康風險評估、制定個人化健康計劃、登記參加「慢性疾病共同治理先導計劃」、配對家庭醫生和安排專屬護士診所及／或專職醫療服務等服務。

過去三年，在各長者健康中心每年接獲的新會員申請宗數載於下表。新申請宗數有下降趨勢，原因包括因應地區康健中心的設立，長者選擇到地區康健中心接受健康評估及服務等。

長者健康中心新登記人數及總登記人數在二○二四年均明顯下跌，而接受首次健康評估的輪候時間中位數在二○二四年則於大部分長者健康中心明顯較長。輪候時間中位數在該年較長的主要原因包括於2019冠狀病毒病疫情期間，長者健康中心由二○二○年一月至二○二三年二月只能提供有限度的服務而積壓部分申請。另外，雖然二○二三年二月開始，長者健康中心的服務已回復正常，但鑑於輪候申請人數已累積至一定數量，而且衞生署醫生人手持續短缺，影響了服務量，這也導致二○二四年的新登記人數及總登記人數下跌。

衞生署與基層醫療署商討分階段整合長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡的同時，亦已增聘了合約醫生以加強人手應對，並會繼續密切監察情況。

（三）考慮到現時長者健康中心的服務容量，政府有需要改變服務模式，更好利用社區基層醫療資源，以提升服務效率，應對人口老化相關醫療需求的迫切問題。

為加強香港基層醫療服務，政府於二○二二年十二月公布《基層醫療健康藍圖》（《藍圖》），重點提出一系列改革措施。隨着以地區為本、以家庭為中心的社區醫療系統不斷發展，《藍圖》建議衞生署轄下的一些基層醫療健康服務，包括長者健康中心，應逐步並有序地整合至基層醫療系統，以便發展社區醫療系統，提供整體及全面的基層醫療服務，提升資源運用效率。為落實《藍圖》和《行政長官2024年施政報告》宣布的基層醫療政策方向及相關措施，基層醫療署會透過服務整合，進一步發展以地區康健中心為樞紐的跨專業基層醫療服務網絡。

基層醫療署計劃在二○二五至二六年度開始分階段為整合衞生署轄下的長者健康中心服務至地區康健網絡作準備，以加強服務協同效應，更好應對長者對基層醫療服務的需求。基層醫療署與衞生署將於稍後公布服務過渡的安排。"
​一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000637.htm,"一名入境女旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（九月十日）在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁八星期及罰款六百元。

海關人員昨日（九月九日）在羅湖管制站截查該名四十四歲抵港女旅客，在其攜帶的個人行李內檢獲一千五百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約六千四百元，應課稅值約五千二百元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，反映即使旅客屬初犯，亦可能被判處監禁，刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

LCQ22: Elderly Health Centres,2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000541.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Chun-ying and a written reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Department of Health has 18 Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) in Hong Kong. Elderly aged 65 and above can be enrolled as members of EHCs. However, it is learnt that the current waiting time for membership is relatively long. As at June this year, these 18 centres were still processing applications submitted in 2023 or earlier. On the other hand, to minimise service duplication, the Primary Healthcare Commission plans to migrate EHC services to District Health Centres (DHCs) in various districts in phases. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following information about the EHC in various districts in each of the past three years: the number of membership applications received, the number of new members and total membership, the average waiting time for membership applications, and the average waiting time for major services such as health screening, medical treatment, injection and dressing;

(2) whether it has examined the reasons for the lengthy processing time for membership applications at EHCs; whether it has taken measures to enhance the speed and efficiency of processing membership applications; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) of the timetable and transitional arrangements for migrating EHC services to DHCs?

Reply:

President,

  To enhance the health of the people of Hong Kong, improve healthcare protection and quality, and capitalise on our healthcare professions' strengths, as announced in ""The Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address"", the Government will conduct a comprehensive review on the positioning and objectives of the healthcare system, which will cover the reforming of functions and division of work among the Department of Health (DH), the Hospital Authority (HA), and the Primary Healthcare Commission (PHC Commission) as well as strengthening health promotion and disease prevention in primary healthcare. The DH will gradually transfer its specialist and primary healthcare services to the HA and the PHC Commission respectively, so as to concentrate its resources to strengthen its regulatory affairs and health protection, etc. Amongst others, the PHC Commission will start preparing for the service integration of the DH's Elderly Health Centres (EHCs) into the district health network in phases, with a view to enhancing service synergy and making appropriate arrangements to meet the needs of the elderly.

  In consultation with the DH, the reply by the Health Bureau to the question raised by the Hon Chan Chun-ying are as follows:

(1) and (2) At present, the DH has established an EHC in each of the 18 districts in Hong Kong to provide integrated primary healthcare services, including health assessment, counselling, health education and curative treatment, to persons aged 65 or above from a family medicine perspective. All persons aged 65 or above are eligible for enrolling as members of the EHC at any EHC.

  Meanwhile, the Government has set up District Health Centres (DHCs) or DHC Expresses (hereinafter collectively referred to as DHCs) across all 18 districts of Hong Kong in 2022. Currently, the DHCs provide services to all members of the public (including the elderly), including provision of health risk factors assessments, development of personalised health plans, signing up for the Chronic Disease Co-Care Pilot Scheme, family doctor pairing, and arrangements for dedicated nurse clinics and/or allied health services.

  The number of new membership applications received annually by each EHC in the past three years are as shown in the table below. The number of new applications has shown a declining trend in view of factors such as the establishment of the DHCs and the elderly's preference for receiving health assessments and services at the DHCs.

Note: Due to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, all EHCs underwent multiple service adjustments from 2020 to early 2023 to redeploy staff from different grades to support epidemic prevention and control. Amongst others, in view of the activation of designated clinics at Robert Black General Out-patient Clinic by the HA, based on infection control considerations at the time of the epidemic, San Po Kong EHC which was situated at the same location with the designated clinic was temporarily closed in the period from February 26, 2022, to February 5, 2023.

  The median waiting time for the first health assessment at various EHCs over the past three years is as shown in the table below. The median refers to the time the elderlies have taken to become a member and receive the first health assessment on the day since they first submitted the application.

  The number of new enrolments and total number of enrolments at the EHCs both declined significantly in 2024. Meanwhile, the median waiting time for the first health assessment was notably longer at most EHCs in 2024. Key factors contributing to the longer median waiting time in that year include the backlog of applications accumulated during the COVID-19 epidemic when the EHCs could only provide limited services from January 2020 to February 2023. Additionally, although services at the EHCs resumed normal starting from February 2023, the accumulated backlog of waiting applications and the persistent shortage of the DH's medical staff have impacted the service capacity. This has also contributed to the decline in both the number of new enrolments and the total number of enrolments in 2024.

  In addition to discussing service integration of EHCs into the district health network in phases with the PHC Commission, the DH has also recruited additional contract doctors to strengthen staffing capacity. The DH will continue to closely monitor the situation.

(3) Considering the current service capacity of the EHCs, there is a need for the Government to transform its service model to allow for better utilisation of community-based primary healthcare resources, enhance service efficiency, and respond to the pressing healthcare demands arising from an ageing population.

  To strengthen primary healthcare services in Hong Kong, the Government released the Primary Healthcare Blueprint (the Blueprint) in December 2022, setting out a series of reform initiatives. The Blueprint recommends that, in line with the development of the district-based, family-centric community health system, certain primary healthcare services under the DH, including the EHCs, be migrated to the primary healthcare system in a progressive and orderly manner. The migration aims to develop a community healthcare system that provides holistic and comprehensive primary healthcare services and utilises resources in a more effective manner. To implement the policy directions and related measures for primary healthcare set out in the Blueprint and the Chief Executive's 2024 Policy Address, the PHC Commission will further expand the multidisciplinary primary healthcare service network with DHCs as hub through service integration.

  The PHC Commission plans to commence preparations in phases starting from 2025-26 for the service integration of EHCs under the DH into the district health network, with a view to enhancing service synergy and better addressing the elderly's demand for primary healthcare services. The PHC Commission and the DH will announce the service migration arrangements in due course."
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-09-10 17:10,2025-09-10 17:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000638.htm,"  An incoming female passenger was sentenced to eight weeks' imprisonment and fined $600 by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (September 10) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

  Customs officers intercepted the incoming 44-year-old female passenger at the Lo Wu Control Point yesterday (September 9) and seized 1 581 duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $6,400 and a duty potential of about $5,200 from her personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

  Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

  Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case involving ocean-going vessel with goods worth about $140 million seized (with photo),2025-09-10 16:45,2025-09-10 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000582.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on August 26 detected a suspected case of using an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods to Korea at the Kwai Chung Container Terminals. A large batch of suspected unmanifested goods with an estimated market value of about $140 million was seized.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, Customs discovered that criminals intended to use an ocean-going vessel to smuggle goods and thus formulated strategies to combat related activities.

On August 26, Customs officers identified an ocean-going vessel preparing to depart from Hong Kong for Korea for inspection, and seized a large batch of suspected scheduled shark skin, electronic goods and parts, and liquor inside two containers on board the vessel.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of arrests is not ruled out.

Customs is the primary agency responsible for tackling smuggling activities and has long been combating various smuggling activities on all fronts. Customs will keep up its enforcement action and continue to resolutely combat sea smuggling activities through proactive risk management and intelligence-based enforcement strategies, and carry out targeted anti-smuggling operations at suitable times to crack down on related crimes.

Smuggling is a serious offence. Under the Import and Export Ordinance, any person found guilty of importing or exporting unmanifested cargo is liable to a maximum fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years upon conviction.

Speech by SJ at thematic breakout session of 10th Belt and Road Summit (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 16:34,2025-09-10 18:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000569.htm,"Following are the welcome remarks by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Paul Lam, SC, at the thematic breakout session entitled Synergy in Legal Solutions: Co-creating a Shared Silk Road Vision of the 10th Belt and Road Summit today (September 10):

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is my great pleasure to welcome you all to join us in this thematic breakout session, which will focus on the legal and dispute resolution services provided by Hong Kong in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI). Before we hear from a distinguished panel of speakers, let me give a brief overview.

  Under the fundamental principle of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong enjoys a number of unique systematic strengths. Among other things, one of such strengths is its international, credible and high-quality legal and dispute resolution services based on its common law system against the background that Hong Kong is the only common law jurisdiction in China.

  The conclusion and execution of Belt and Road projects, irrespective of their nature, are bound to involve transboundary legal issues. In order to safeguard and promote the parties' interests, and as an essential component of risk management, international legal services are inevitable.

Non-contentious legal services

  Let me start with non-contentious legal services, for example, the drafting of contracts and other legal documents, the provision of general legal advices, and the establishment of business entities.

  All Belt and Road co-operation agreements would need to be reduced into legally enforceable contracts. When the parties come from different jurisdictions and the execution of the project itself involves different countries, one of the most important primary question is to decide on the governing law of the legal agreement. I would venture to suggest that Hong Kong law provides one of the best options. We have a bilingual legal system under which both Chinese and English are equally authentic. Our common law, in particular, international civil and commercial law and practice, are very familiar to the international business community. In the IMD (International Institute for Management Development) World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 published in June this year, Hong Kong ranks first in the world in the sub-factor ""Business legislation"".

  One unique characteristic of our common law system is that, while it is separated from the legal system in Mainland, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) and the Mainland have entered into a number of mutual legal assistance arrangements, which would enable overseas parties to explore business opportunities in the Mainland while enjoying the benefits offered by Hong Kong's legal system. For example, these arrangements cover the mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments in civil and commercial matters, and also arbitral awards.

  To take full advantage of the benefits offered by Hong Kong's legal system, it is most advisable to consider setting up business and corporate vehicles in Hong Kong for the purpose of executing co-operation or joint-venture agreements under the B&RI. The most obvious and important advantage is that Hong Kong entities would be entitled to all the tax benefits under Hong Kong law. In the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025 which I mentioned a moment ago, Hong Kong also ranks first in the sub-factor ""Tax policy"". And, of course, Hong Kong corporate vehicles may be conveniently used to raise finance and capital to fund Belt and Road projects in Hong Kong, which is one of the most important international financial centres in the world. There are also other privileges which are only available to Hong Kong enterprises. Let me give you one example: since mid-February this year, Hong Kong enterprises, including companies with some Hong Kong interests irrespective of the extent thereof, in the major cities of the Greater Bay Area in Guangdong Province, now enjoy the option to choose Hong Kong law as the governing law of their contracts with other Mainland enterprises, and to choose Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration for resolving disputes.

  It is indisputable that Hong Kong has an abundant supply of legal professionals who are highly regarded by the international community. With rich experience and strong expertise in international business, commercial, financial and investment law, our legal professionals serve as ""global"" lawyers in the sense that, apart from providing legal services related to Hong Kong law, they are able to advise and provide services on legal issues involving other jurisdictions in the light of their good and extensive connections with other jurisdictions. Currently, 280 law firms in Hong Kong have overseas offices, 85 have representative offices in the Mainland; there are 27 registered associations of firms formed jointly by local and foreign laws, 85 foreign law firms and more than 1 600 foreign lawyers.

Dispute resolution services

  Let me now move on to dispute resolution services. The starting point is that, under the principle of ""one country, two systems"", our Judiciary enjoys the independent power of adjudication including that of final adjudication. In our highest court, namely the Court of Final Appeal, apart from local judges, eminent judges from other common law jurisdictions such as the UK (United Kingdom), Australia and New Zealand have been invited to sit as foreign non-permanent judges to ensure that our common law jurisprudence will be of the highest quality and meet the expectations of the international community.

  Turning to other modes of dispute resolution, Hong Kong is well regarded as one of the top international arbitration centres. According to the 2025 International Arbitration Survey conducted by Queen Mary University of London, Hong Kong ranks as the second most preferred seat for arbitration globally and the first in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2024, 76.4 per cent of the arbitrations submitted to the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) were international in nature. B&RI countries and jurisdictions account for the majority of the geographical origins or nationalities of arbitrators appointed, as well as parties participating in HKIAC arbitrations. Our Judiciary is also renowned for its strong pro-arbitration stance.

It is impossible not to mention mediation. The establishment of the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) is an important supplement to the current international dispute settlement regime, marking a milestone in promoting the settlement of international disputes, which include disputes between a government and foreign nationals and also international commercial disputes, through mediation. The Signing Ceremony of the Convention on the Establishment of the IOMed was held in Hong Kong on May 30, 2025. Up to date, 36 countries, including China, have signed the Convention, and I believe all of them are B&RI countries. It is noteworthy that the headquarters of the IOMed is situated in Hong Kong; and subject to rules to be made by IOMed, the government and nationals of state parties who have not yet signed or ratified the Convention will also be entitled to use the service of the IOMed.

Capacity building

  We also see capacity building as an important component of international legal collaborations. The Department of Justice (DoJ) established the Hong Kong International Legal Talents Training Academy in November 2024. The Academy provides tailor-made training programmes in collaboration with different jurisdictions and international organisations on topics including international law, international arbitration, Hong Kong common law, and so on and so forth.

Collaboration with BR&I countries

  The Hong Kong Government is committed to enhancing legal collaborations with Belt and Road countries and the Mainland to assist in the construction of B&RI. The seventh Hong Kong Legal Services Forum was held in Xi'an, a key strategic city in western China under the B&RI, in May this year, and the theme was about cross-border transactions and foreign investment under the B&RI.

  Memoranda of Understanding on legal co-operation were signed with the Minister of Justice of Saudi Arabia and the Minister of Commerce of Cambodia in April last year and May this year respectively. I am very pleased that, just this morning, my department also signed a Memorandum of Co-operation with the Ministry of Law and Justice of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on strengthening co-operation on dispute avoidance and resolution. This Memorandum is the sixth with jurisdictions along the Belt and Road.

  Furthermore, since I assumed my present position as the Secretary for Justice, I have organised a number of trips leading a delegation consisting of legal professionals from Hong Kong to visit various Belt and Road countries in the Middle East and South East Asia.

  All in all, I firmly believe that Hong Kong will be of great assistance to all friends taking part in Belt and Road projects by providing one-stop legal services covering the whole business cycle of such projects, from inception to fruition. Our international, credible and top-quality legal professionals are ready, willing and able to serve and fight for your best interests.

  Looking ahead, the DoJ will continue to use different means to enhance legal co-operations and collaborations with other jurisdictions along the Belt and Road, and to promote and refine our legal and dispute resolution services to ensure that they will meet the expectations and demands of potential and actual users. On this note, I wish you all a constructive and enjoyable session this afternoon. Thank you."

LCQ6: Development of telemedicine services,2025-09-10 16:25,2025-09-10 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000551.htm,"  Following is a question by Professor the Hon Chan Wing-kwong and a reply by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  Regarding the development of telemedicine services, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that the Hospital Authority (HA) provides telemedicine services through the ""HA Go"" mobile application and the clinical management system used by healthcare professionals, whether the Government knows the number of tele-consultation services provided by the HA through these channels to date, the number of patients involved as well as the respective feedback from healthcare professionals and patients on these services;

(2) whether it knows the number of complaints concerning telemedicine services received by the Government and relevant public organisations in the past three years, and the content and follow-up situations respectively of those complaints; and

(3) as a study released earlier on by the Consumer Council has pointed out the privacy risks involved when consumers receive telemedicine services through applications such as WhatsApp and Zoom nowadays, whether the authorities will consider strengthening the functionality of eHealth or ""HA Go"" mobile applications, so that private healthcare service providers can provide telemedicine services to patients through these platforms and applications, so as to enhance the protection of personal information and health data, and promote the development of telemedicine services?

Reply:

President,

  Telehealth is a type of medical service that should be provided by qualified healthcare professionals and governed by the regulatory boards and councils of relevant healthcare professions. Healthcare professionals have the responsibility to ensure services provided through telehealth comply with the codes and guidelines promulgated by regulatory authorities, are suited for the clinical setting and objective of patients, and must not compromise the professional standard because of service modes. The Medical Council of Hong Kong's Ethical Guidelines on Practice of Telemedicine stipulates clearly that doctors need to be aware of the limits of any telehealth applications and electronic communications, and alternatives must be considered if technical and environmental limitations affect telehealth services as to compromising the professional standard and duty of care of medical practices.

  While the Government encourages professions to provide medical services by innovative means, non-healthcare professionals and companies must not untruthfully promote or even provide telehealth. The Government will scrutinise advertisement on telehealth to ascertain whether there are violation of the Undesirable Medical Advertisements Ordinance (Cap. 231) and whether the services so provided have violated regulations under other legislations concerning practising without a licence.

  In response to the questions raised by Professor the Hon Chan Wing-kwong, my consolidated reply is as follows:

  During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth services became prevalent in Hong Kong, being an important anti-epidemic strategy during the critical period. Telehealth has certain limitations, for instance, the establishment of a doctor-patient relationship may prove challenging, and such services may not be suitable for patients requiring in-person clinical examinations for diagnosis. Furthermore, telehealth services rely on stable technological infrastructure. Issues such as network stability, equipment, or other technical problems may affect service quality. Requiring patients to possess related equipment may increase time costs and technological threshold, particularly for elderly patients or those not familiar with technology.

  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Hospital Authority (HA) has started to develop telehealth as a complementary measure, and has been managing the limitations of telehealth cautiously. Generally speaking, telehealth services are more suitable for chronic patients who are clinically stable, not new cases as well as those who do not need to visit hospitals to undergo clinical examinations by doctors. The HA will arrange medical services through telehealth, having taken into account the stability of the clinical conditions of patients, their clinical needs, and actual operational situations. During the three years from April 2022 to March 2025, telehealth was involved in more than 340000 non-COVID-19 cases, including tele-consultations provided by the Community Geriatric Assessment Teams for elderly living in residential care homes for the elderly, allied health (e.g. clinical psychology service) and specialist out-patient services. The pharmacies also provide drug counselling services through remote means.

  The HA's telehealth services have been operating smoothly since inception, with positive feedback from patients who generally consider the workflow simple and user-friendly, and particularly convenient for patients residing in remote areas or with mobility difficulties. Over the past three years, the HA received two complaints regarding telehealth services that mainly involved patients not being clearly informed about the service workflow, such as arrangements regarding booking appointments, drug collection and referral letters. The HA had promptly provided detailed explanations and followed up with the patients concerned. The HA will continue to regularly review the impact after the application of telehealth to ensure the services can better meet patients' needs while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

  The HA's ""HA Go"" app is designed to assist its patients in managing their services in public hospitals and clinics, and is not suitable for use by private healthcare providers or other patients. On the other hand, the Government is implementing the ""eHealth+"" five-year development plan to upgrade eHealth into a comprehensive healthcare information infrastructure that integrates data sharing, service delivery and process management, with a view to supporting various healthcare policies more effectively. In considering the development of ""eHealth+"", we have to carefully assess the relevant factors, such as the appropriateness of the relevant functions, the effective use of public resources, data privacy and system security.

  The Government will continue to closely monitor the development and adoption of telehealth services in Hong Kong, and will work with the sector and relevant stakeholders to explore the further development of telehealth in suitable services, such as outreach services and primary healthcare services including nurse clinics and allied health services, etc. The Government will also ensure boards and councils of various healthcare professions would promulgate and review specific guidelines on telehealth in a timely manner based on professional practice and operational needs, with a view to protecting the interests of patients and healthcare professionals.

  Thank you, President."
立法會六題：遙距醫療服務的發展,2025-09-10 16:25,2025-09-10 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000531.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳永光議員的提問和醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授的答覆︰

問題：

關於遙距醫療服務的發展，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉醫院管理局（醫管局）透過「HA Go」流動應用程式及供醫護人員使用的臨床管理系統提供遙距醫療服務，政府是否知悉，至今醫管局透過該等途徑提供了多少次遙距診症服務，以及涉及的病人數目為何；醫護人員和病人對該等服務的意見反饋分別為何；

（二）是否知悉，過去三年政府及相關公營機構收到多少宗有關遙距醫療服務的投訴，以及該等投訴的內容及跟進情況分別為何；及

（三）鑑於消費者委員會早前公布的一項研究指出，現時消費者透過WhatsApp及Zoom等應用程式接受遙距醫療服務存在私隱風險問題，當局會否考慮加強醫健通或「HA Go」流動應用程式的功能，讓私營醫療服務提供者能夠透過該等平台及應用程式為病人提供遙距醫療服務，以加強對個人資料和健康數據的保護，並促進遙距醫療服務的發展？

答覆：

主席：

遙距醫療是醫療服務，必須由合資格醫護人員提供，並受相關醫護專業的管理局及委員會監管。醫護人員有責任確保通過遙距醫療提供的服務符合規管機構的守則及指引，並切合病人的臨床情況和臨床目標，醫護人員的專業水平絕不應因為服務模式不同而有所妥協。香港醫務委員會的遙距醫療實務道德規範指引清晰指出，醫生需要了解任何遙距醫療應用和電子通訊的局限性，如果技術和環境限制影響遙距醫療服務，以致無法滿足醫生執業的專業標準及謹慎責任，則必須考慮替代方案。

雖然政府鼓勵業界通過創新方式提供醫療服務，非醫護專業人員及企業不應作不實宣傳，甚至提供遙距醫療。政府會審視遙距醫療的廣告有否違反《不良廣告（醫藥）條例》（第231章）的規定，以及其服務有否違反其他法例下無牌執業的規定。

就陳永光議員的提問，現綜合回覆如下：

2019冠狀病毒病疫情期間，香港的遙距醫療服務開始普及，在非常時期作為一個重要的抗疫政策。遙距醫療存在一定局限，例如較難建立醫患關係，亦未必適合需實地接受臨床身體檢查以作出診治的病人。此外，遙距醫療服務亦依賴穩定的技術基礎設施，網絡、設備或其他技術問題都可能會影響服務質量。要求病人具備相關設備，可能會增加時間成本和技術門檻，尤其是一些較年長或不熟悉科技的病人。

因應2019冠狀病毒病疫情的情況，醫院管理局（醫管局）開始發展遙距醫療作為輔助，並一直謹慎處理遙距醫療的局限。一般而言，遙距醫療較適用於慢性病患而病情穩定、並非新症以及無須親臨醫院接受醫生臨床檢查的病人。醫管局會視乎病人的臨床情況穩定性、臨床需要及實際運作情況以安排遙距診症的醫療服務。由二○二二年四月至二○二五年三月的三年期間，參與遙距醫療的非新冠個案超過34萬宗，包括社區老人評估小組為安老院舍長者提供的遙距診症、專職醫療（如臨床心理學家服務）和專科門診服務。藥劑部亦會透過遙距方法提供用藥指導服務。

醫管局的遙距醫療服務自推展以來運作大致順暢，病人反應正面，普遍認為流程簡單易用，尤其是為居住在偏遠地區或行動不便的病人帶來方便。過去三年，醫管局共收到兩宗有關遙距醫療服務的投訴，主要涉及未能使病人清晰了解服務流程，例如預約及領取藥物和轉介信的安排。醫管局已隨即向有關病人詳細解釋及跟進情況。醫管局會繼續定期檢討遙距診症的應用效果，令服務更切合病人需要和符合成本效益。

醫管局的「HA Go」流動應用程式目標是協助病人管理其在公立醫院及診所的服務，並不適合供私營醫療服務提供者或其他病人使用。另一方面，政府現正推展「醫健通+」五年計劃，將醫健通提升為一個集合數據互通、服務提供以及流程管理於一身的綜合醫療資訊基建，以更有效地支援各項醫療政策。在考慮「醫健通+」的發展時，我們須審慎衡量相關功能的適切性、所需公共資源運用的效益、資料私隱和系統保安措施等相關因素。

政府會繼續密切留意遙距醫療服務在香港的推展及普及情況，與業界及相關持份者共同探討遙距醫療在合適的服務，例如外展服務和護士診所、專職醫療服務等基層醫療服務方面的進一步發展。政府並將確保各個醫護專業的管理局及委員會按照行業特色和實務需要，訂出並適時修訂遙距醫療的具體指引，以期保障病人和醫護人員的權益。

多謝主席。"

答覆：

主席：

面對極端天氣，政府在超前準備、加強預警、果斷應急、迅速復原的策略框架下，制定具前瞻性的「綜合防洪管理策略」，以應對氣候變化的影響。此策略致力結合適應、應變及管理的措施，以提升本港整體的防洪能力。針對鄉郊地區的情況，除了推動地區排水系統改善工程外，政府亦持續加強相關的防洪管理工作，以提升其防洪能力。

就劉業強議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）過去五年多（即二○二○年至二○二五年八月），渠務署在大嶼山南區共確認七宗水浸個案，詳情如下：

根據調查結果，以上水浸個案主要是由於暴雨期間，大量枯葉及雜物被沖至位處於低窪的路邊集水溝、進水口及排水道，並造成阻塞，令雨水難以進入下游的雨水收集及排放系統，引致水浸情況。上述水浸個案均於一至兩小時內完成處理及清除積水。

（二）至（四）渠務署會定期為公共雨水排放系統進行巡查、清理及維修保養。以大嶼山南區為例，今年截至八月，署方已為公共雨水排放系統完成28次巡查及渠道清理工作。

渠務署與天文台緊密聯繫，當預測暴雨即將來臨時，渠務署會實施「及時清渠」安排，調配人手巡查容易受枯葉及雜物等阻塞的位置，並清理淤塞的渠道，以減低大雨期間的水浸風險。此外，每當天文台發出紅色或黑色暴雨警告信號、新界北部水浸特別報告、八號或以上熱帶氣旋警告信號，渠務署便會即時啓動緊急事故控制中心，並派遣緊急應變隊伍處理市民求助個案，清理水浸情況。

現時，全港約有240個渠道容易淤塞點，當中多於一半位於新界及離島地區，包括四個位於大嶼山南區。為進一步強化緊急事故控制中心在極端天氣情況下的應變能力，渠務署已增加緊急應變隊伍的數目，由去年160隊擴展至今年180隊，以及設立超過30個分布全港各區的應急運作基地，當中位處梅窩的應急運作基地能迅速派遣緊急應變隊伍到大嶼山南區（包括鹹田村或十塱村等地）應對水浸事件。

每當暴雨過後，渠務署均會檢視每個水浸個案的成因，並與相關部門探討並按需要進行合適的排水系統改善工程以緩減水浸風險。因應最近暴雨引致的水浸事故，政府正計劃在鹹田村和十塱村進行排水設施改善工程，例如加設排水管道，以及為居民安裝擋水裝置提供技術支援。

渠務署為市民應對水浸事件推行多項支援措施，包括設立24小時電話熱線（2300 1110），以便更有效直接接收水浸個案報告，讓渠務署可快速處理。另外，各相關政府部門，例如民政事務總署、路政署及食物環境衞生署亦會定期巡查及清理相關的雨水排放設施。渠務署會與各相關部門保持緊密聯繫，確保公共雨水排放系統正常運作。渠務署亦會繼續與地區人士保持溝通及聽取居民的意見，以進一步減低有關地區的水浸風險。"
LCQ21: Handling of flooding in Islands District,2025-09-10 15:47,2025-09-10 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000522.htm,"ââFollowing is a question by the Hon Kenneth Lau and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

 The Hong Kong Observatory has recently issued the Black Rainstorm Signal on multiple occasions. It is learnt that consecutive rainstorms have caused serious flooding in a number of rural areas, including South Lantau Road on Lantau Island, Ham Tin Kau Tsuen and Ham Tin San Tsuen (Ham Tin Tsuen), Shap Long Kau Tsuen and Shap Long San Tsuen (Shap Long Tsuen), and Yung Shue Wan on Lamma Island. After the consecutive black rainstorms, I have visited Ham Tin Tsuen and Shap Long Tsuen, where a relatively large number of elderly persons reside. Local villagers have relayed that flooding into houses occurred during every rainstorm, causing all their electrical appliances and wiring to be soaked and posing dangers; however, when villagers telephoned the relevant government departments for assistance, no immediate handling was provided, resulting in heavy losses on their part and leaving them at a loss. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of flooding reports from villages in South Lantau received by the authorities in each of the past five years; the main causes for the occurrence of flooding in such cases; the handling time required and outcome for each case respectively;

(2) regarding the situation of flooding into houses and damage to wiring and electrical appliances occur during every rainstorm relayed by the aforesaid villagers, of the immediate or long-term remedial measures that the Government will adopt;

(3) whether it has regularly (for example, annually or quarterly) inspected and cleared the drainage channels in the aforesaid areas to ensure proper functioning of the drainage systems; if so, of the situation of blockage of drainage channels found during the inspections, as well as the respective numbers of relevant inspections and clearances; and

(4) in the face of increasingly frequent extreme weather events, of the measures in place to assist villagers in the aforesaid areas (especially elderly persons) to enhance their capabilities in coping with rainstorms and flooding; whether it will strengthen the support for them under rainstorms and flooding in future (for example, setting up a dedicated hotline or a response team)?

Reply:

President,

 In coping with extreme weather, the Government has developed a forward-looking Integrated Flood Management Strategy under a framework of advanced emergency preparedness, enhanced early warning, decisive emergency response and speedy recovery, to combat the impacts brought by climate change. This strategy aims to integrate adaptation, response, and management to enhance the overall flood resilience of Hong Kong. Regarding the situation in rural areas, in addition to carrying out improvement works to local drainage systems, the Government is also continuously strengthening related flood management work to enhance the flood protection abilities.

 My respective replies to the various parts of the Hon KennethLau's question are as follows:

(1) Over the past five years (from 2020 to August 2025), the Drainage Services Department (DSD) has confirmed seven flooding cases in South Lantau. The details are as follows:




Year
No. of Confirmed Flooding Case


2025 (up to August)

 According to the investigation results, the aforementioned flooding cases were primarily caused by heavy rainfall, during which a large amount of fallen leaves and debris were washed into low-lying roadside gullies, intakes, and drainage channels, leading to blockages. This hindered the natural flow of rainwater into the downstream stormwater collection and drainage systems, leading to flooding. All of these flooding cases were handled and resolved within one to two hours.

(2) to (4) The DSD conducts regular inspections, cleansing, and maintenance of public stormwater drainage systems. For example in South Lantau, the department has completed 28 inspections and cleansing operations for the public stormwater drainage system as of August this year.

 The DSD maintains close collaboration with the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). Before the onset of a heavy rainstorm, the department implements a ""just-in-time clearance"" arrangement. Manpower will be deployed to inspect and clear drains that are prone to blockages caused by fallen leaves and debris, so as to reduce the risk of flooding during heavy rain. Additionally, when the HKO issues a Red or Black Rainstorm Warning Signal, a Special Announcement on Flooding in the northern New Territories or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal of number 8 or above, the DSD will immediately activate its Emergency Control Centre and deploy emergency response teams to address public requests for assistance and handle flooding cases.

 Currently, there are approximately 240 drainage points in Hong Kong that are prone to blockage, more than half of which are located in the New Territories and Islands, including four in South Lantau. To further enhance the response capabilities of Emergency Control Centre during extreme weather conditions, the DSD has increased the number of emergency response teams from 160 last year to 180 this year. Additionally, over 30 emergency operation stations across the territories have been established. The emergency operation station at Mui Wo can quickly deploy emergency response teams to South Lantau, including areas such as Ham Tin Village and Shap Long Village to tackle flooding incidents.

 Following every heavy rainstorm, the DSD reviews the causes of each flooding case and collaborates with relevant departments to discuss and implement necessary drainage improvement works, aimed at mitigating flood risks. In response to recent flooding incidents caused by heavy rain, the Government plans to carry out drainage improvement works in Ham Tin Village and Shap Long Village, such as installing additional drainage pipes and providing technical support for residents to install flood barriers.

 The DSD has implemented several support measures to help the public to cope with flooding incidents. These include establishing a 24-hour hotline (2300 1110) to efficiently receive and swiftly handling flooding reports. In addition, relevant government departments, such as the Home Affairs Department, the Highways Department, and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, conduct regular inspections and cleansing of related stormwater drainage facilities. The DSD maintains close liaison with these departments to ensure the proper functioning of the public stormwater drainage system. The DSD will continue to liaise with the local community and gather feedback from citizens with a view to further reducing the flooding risks in the affected areas."

問題：

據悉政府近年積極推動市區更新，以「復修為先」的策略取代大規模重建，藉此改善樓宇結構安全，以延長樓宇壽命。本人近日接獲市民反映，即使樓宇已完成復修工程並符合安全標準，令其使用年期得以延長，但銀行在審批按揭時仍採用「75減樓齡」的計算方法（即樓齡逾55年的住宅物業只能獲批最長20年的按揭年期），這不但加重了市民在首期及每月按揭供款的負擔，也減低舊樓的流通性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）據悉政府大力推動樓宇復修以取代重建，當局有否與香港金融管理局商討，適度調高已完成復修並通過安全檢驗的樓宇的按揭年期；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；

（二）政府會否考慮為已完成訂明檢驗及訂明修葺的樓宇設立認證機制，讓銀行在審批該等樓宇的按揭時可考慮延長按揭年期；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）有否統計現時樓齡50年或以上的住宅物業的以下資料：（i）整體數量、（ii）當中持有按揭的住戶數目，以及（iii）其每月按揭供款及借貸還款的中位數；如沒有統計，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

就問題的三個部分，經諮詢發展局及香港金融管理局（金管局）後，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）政府的樓宇更新策略是復修和重建並重。屋宇署每年會按風險揀選約600幢樓齡達30年或以上的私人樓宇（註一）發出強制驗樓法定通知（驗樓通知），着令業主為大廈的公用部分及個別單位的伸出物進行檢驗及修葺。至今獲發出驗樓通知的8 364幢樓宇，約百分之七十為樓齡50年或以上。妥善保養物業是業主責任，不但可保障住戶、建築物及公眾安全，也可延長樓宇的壽命，對維持物業價值有正面作用。

如業主完成驗樓通知的要求，屋宇署會向業主發信確認通知已獲遵辦。此外，公眾可透過屋宇署網站，查閱個別私人樓宇是否獲發法定通知，以及其遵辦情況。如業主沒有收到法定通知而自願按照強制驗樓計劃的要求完成檢驗及修葺，屋宇署亦會向相關業主發出證明信件。

金管局沒有就按揭物業的樓齡設立按揭年限。銀行的貸款審批是其自身商業決定，銀行在審批按揭申請時會考慮一籃子因素，包括借款人還款能力和樓宇狀況，當中物業的樓齡只是其中一個考慮因素。在考慮是否審批住宅按揭申請時，上述由屋宇署發出有關樓宇完成檢驗及修葺的資料相信會有助銀行評估樓宇狀況。

（三）根據屋宇署紀錄，截至二○二四年底，有8 977幢私人住宅樓宇的樓齡為50年或以上（不包括新界豁免管制屋宇）。至於該些私人住宅樓宇內的單位是否持有按揭、其按揭貸款的供款及還款的具體資料，由於是業主與銀行之間的協議，政府沒有備存相關商業數據作統計之用。

LCQ17: Mortgage terms for aged buildings,2025-09-10 15:30,2025-09-10 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000373.htm,"  Following is a question by Dr the Hon Wendy Hong and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It is learnt that in recent years, the Government has actively promoted urban renewal, replacing large-scale redevelopment with a ""rehabilitation first"" strategy to improve building structural safety and prolong their lifespan. Members of the public have recently relayed to me that, even when rehabilitation works have been completed for the buildings and safety standards met to prolong their service life, banks still adopt the ""75 minus building age"" calculation method (i.e. residential properties over 55 years old can only be granted a maximum mortgage term of 20 years) when assessing mortgage applications. This not only adds to the burden of down payments and monthly mortgage payments on members of the public, but also reduces the liquidity of old buildings. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as it is learnt that the Government is vigorously promoting building rehabilitation as an alternative to redevelopment, whether the authorities have discussed with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority the possibility of appropriately extending the mortgage term for buildings that have completed rehabilitation and passed safety inspections; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether the Government will consider establishing a certification mechanism for buildings that have completed prescribed inspections and prescribed repairs, so that banks may consider extending the mortgage term when approving mortgages for such buildings; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information of residential properties currently aged 50 years or above: (i) the total number, (ii) the number of households having mortgages among them, and (iii) their median monthly mortgage payments and loan repayments; if it has not compiled statistics, of the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  After consulting the Development Bureau and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), our reply to the three parts of the question is as follows:

(1) & (2) The Government's strategy for building renewal emphasises both rehabilitation and redevelopment. The Buildings Department (BD) annually selects about 600 private buildings (Note 1) aged 30 years or above on a risk basis and the owners of such building served with statutory mandatory building inspection notices (MBI notices) are required to carry out inspections and repairs for the common parts of their buildings and the projections of the individual units. Among the 8 364 buildings served with MBI notices so far, about 70 per cent of them aged 50 years or above. Proper maintenance and repair of properties are owners' primary responsibility. It not only protects the safety of residents, buildings and the public, but also extends the buildings' lifespan, which has a positive impact on the property values.

  If the owners have complied with the requirements of the MBI notices, the BD will issue compliance letters to the owners. Besides, the public can enquire and view the service and compliance status of the statutory notices of the private buildings via the BD's website. Where owners have voluntarily arranged and carried out building inspection and repair in accordance with the requirements and procedures under the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme, the BD will also issue acknowledgement letters to the owners.

  The HKMA does not set a specific mortgage term limit based on the age of a property. The approval of loans is a commercial decision made by banks. When processing mortgage applications, banks take into account a host of factors, including the borrower's repayment capacity and the condition of the building. The age of the property is only one of the factors of consideration. When considering whether to approve mortgage applications for a residential property, the abovementioned information issued by the BD regarding the completion of inspection and repair of the building may assist banks in evaluating the condition of the building.

(3) According to the BD's record, as at the end of 2024, there were 8 977 private residential buildings aged 50 years or above (excluding New Territories Exempted Houses). As regards whether the units in those private residential buildings have a mortgage and the specific details about the mortgage loan payments and repayments, they are agreements reached between the property owners and the banks. The Government does not maintain relevant commercial data for statistical purposes.

Note 1: Except domestic buildings not exceeding three storeys."
LCQ19: Support for construction industry talents,2025-09-10 15:15,2025-09-10 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000504.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Tony Tse and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

With the endeavours made by me and the industry, the Government launched a subsidy scheme in 2020 (2020 Scheme) as a means of encouraging and supporting private organisations to employ graduates and assistant professionals of the engineering, architectural, surveying, town planning and landscape (EASTL) sectors, so as to enable them to acquire necessary work experience in order to obtain professional qualifications and to alleviate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry. As the impacts of the pandemic on the job market remained, the Development Bureau further launched in 2021 an initiative called Support for Engineering, Architectural, Surveying, Town Planning and Landscape Sectors 2.0 (2021 Scheme) to assist the industry in tiding over the difficult times and reducing its manpower drain. In view of the recent downturn in the construction industry, the Government announced in the Budget of this year that the Construction Industry Council (CIC) would allocate around $150 million to subsidise the construction industry to provide on-the-job training for about 2 500 graduates of the EASTL degree programmes (2025 Scheme) and provide a monthly subsidy of $5,000 to each eligible/approved young talent for a period of 12 months. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the following details about the 2020 Scheme and the 2021 Scheme: (i) the number of applications for subsidy places, (ii) the number of approved subsidy places, (iii) the number of employees to whom salary subsidies were actually disbursed, and (iv) the total amount of salary subsidies eventually disbursed, with a breakdown by professional sector;

(2) of the following details about the 2025 Scheme: (i) the number of applications for subsidy places, and (ii) the number of approved subsidy places, with a breakdown by professional sector;

(3) as some members of the industry have expressed that with the severe downturn in the construction industry, it is expected that many companies will be unable to increase their employment of graduates, whether the Government and the CIC will take account of the actual circumstances and, without the need for additional resources, appropriately increase the monthly subsidy amount under the 2025 Scheme, so as to enhance the industry's motivation to employ more graduates; and

(4) as there are views suggesting that the downturn in the construction industry is expected to persist for quite some time, and massive development projects (including the Northern Metropolis) will require a substantial amount of related professional talents in the future, whether the Government will consider the provision of additional subsidies and an extension of the relevant subsidy scheme?

Reply:

President,

The Development Bureau (DEVB) and the Construction Industry Council (CIC) have been closely monitoring the situation of the construction industry. We have introduced suitable schemes, including the funding schemes mentioned in the subject question launched under the Anti-epidemic Fund during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 (i.e. 2020 Scheme and 2021 Scheme), and the Construction Industry Professional Degree Graduate On-the-Job Training Subsidy Scheme (2025 Scheme) launched through the CIC's allocation of $150 million this year, to support the industry in overcoming prevailing difficulties and to nurture and retain talent for the industry.

In response to the various parts of the LegCo question, the DEVB's corresponding replies are as follows:

(1) The details of the 2020 Scheme are as follows:




Professional discipline
Number of applications for subsidy places
Number of approved subsidy places
Number of employees to whom salary subsidies were disbursed
Total subsidy disbursed

(2) The application period for the 2025 Scheme was from March 17 to April 16, 2025. The CIC completed the processing of applications and notified all successful applicants in May 2025. The details of the 2025 Scheme are as follows:

(3) As all the 2 500 quotas under the 2025 Scheme have already been allocated, thereby using up all its allocation of $150 million, the CIC is unable to further increase the monthly subsidy amount.

Furthermore, with the support of the DEVB, the CIC allocated an additional $24 million in March 2025 to subsidise the construction industry to provide on-the-job training for 400 higher diploma graduates in engineering, architecture, surveying, town planning, and landscape architecture. Successful applicants for this funding scheme will receive a monthly subsidy of $5,000 for each approved higher diploma graduate for a period of 12 months, amounting to $60,000 in total. The application period for this scheme was the same as the aforementioned 2025 Scheme. The CIC has already completed the application processing and notified all successful applicants in May 2025.

For the above two schemes, the CIC has allocated a total of $174 million to subsidise the construction industry to provide on-the-job training for a total of 2 900 graduates.

(4) The construction industry generally welcomed and supported the above two subsidy schemes launched in 2025, acknowledging that they are helpful to the current situation of the industry. The DEVB, in collaboration with the CIC, will continue to maintain close communication with the industry, to keep in view the implementation of the schemes, the overall situation of the industry, the needs of different stakeholders and the CIC's budget for the coming years, and to consider the future arrangement for the schemes."

問題：

在本人與業界爭取下，政府於二○二○年推出資助計劃（二○二○年計劃），鼓勵和支持私人機構聘用工程、建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界別的畢業生和助理專業人員，讓他們取得所需工作經驗以獲取專業資格，紓緩新冠疫情對業界的衝擊。由於疫情持續影響就業市場，發展局於二○二一年再度推出「支援工程、建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界2.0」的措施（二○二一年計劃），協助業界渡過困境和減少人才流失。因應近期建造業不景氣的情況，政府在本年度《財政預算案》宣布，由建造業議會出資約1.5億元，資助建造業界為合共約2 500名工程、建築、測量、都市規劃及園境界的學位課程畢業生提供在職培訓（二○二五年計劃），向每名合資格／獲批核的青年專才提供每月5,000元的津貼，為期12個月。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）二○二○年計劃及二○二一年計劃的以下資料：（i）申請資助名額數目、（ii）獲批的資助名額數目、（iii）實際獲發放薪金津貼的僱員人數，以及（iv）最終發放的薪金津貼總額，並按專業界別列出分項數字；

（二）二○二五年計劃的以下資料：（i）申請資助名額數目，以及（ii）獲批的資助名額數目，並按專業界別列出分項數字；

（三）鑑於有業界人士反映，建造業不景氣的情況嚴峻，預計不少公司都未能增聘畢業生，政府及建造業議會會否因應實際情況及在無須增撥資源的情況下，適度調高二○二五年計劃的每月津貼金額，以加強鼓勵業界聘用更多畢業生；及

（四）鑑於有意見認為，估計建造業不景氣的情況將持續一段時間，加上未來大型發展（包括北部都會區等）需要大量相關專業人才，政府會否考慮增撥資助和延長有關資助計劃？

答覆：

主席：

發展局聯同建造業議會一直密切留意建造業界的情況，在業界有需要時推出適切的計劃，包括題述於二○二○年及二○二一年疫情時透過「防疫抗疫基金」推出的資助計劃（即二○二○年計劃及二○二一年計劃），以及今年透過建造業議會撥款1.5億元推出的「建造業專業學位課程畢業生在職培訓津貼計劃」（二○二五年計劃），支援業界渡過難關，並為行業培育及挽留人才。

計及上述兩項計劃，建造業議會總共撥款1.74億元，資助建造業界為合共2 900名畢業生提供在職培訓。

（四）建造業界普遍歡迎及支持上述兩項二○二五年推出的資助計劃，認同對行業現時的情況有所幫助。發展局聯同建造業議會會繼續與業界保持緊密溝通，檢視計劃的執行狀況及業界整體情況、不同持分者的需要，以及議會未來數年的財政預算，考慮計劃的未來安排。"
LCQ13: Promoting development of yacht industry,2025-09-10 15:01,2025-09-10 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000402.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Benson Luk and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

In the second quarter of this year, the Guangdong Maritime Safety Administration issued the Implementation Plan for the Free Flow of Yachts among Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao (Draft for Comments) (the Plan) with the aim of promoting the synergistic development of the yacht industry in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and facilitating the flow of yachts in the GBA. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the SAR Government has plans to formulate measures to dovetail with the proposals for the free flow of yachts in the Plan, so as to expedite the promotion of the yacht industry's development in Hong Kong; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(2) whether it has plans to permit non-Hong Kong yachts to enter and exit Hong Kong waters for multiple times within a specified period upon entering Hong Kong without having to undergo port formalities again, and to hold discussions with the Government of Guangdong Province on streamlining the immigration arrangements for yachts, so that non-Hong Kong yachts with the permission to enter Hong Kong waters may also sail to other Mainland cities in the GBA; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(3) whether it has plans to streamline the existing immigration and customs clearance procedures for yacht crew and passengers entering and exiting Hong Kong, such as streamlining the existing requirement that yacht masters or their agents must undergo formalities such as immigration inspection and customs declaration at different locations; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that;

(4) given that under the law, non-Hong Kong yachts must obtain the permission of the Director of Marine in order to navigate in Hong Kong waters, whether the authorities have plans to streamline the vetting and approval procedures for such vessels to navigate in Hong Kong waters; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) of the ways to motivate enterprises to organise more yacht exhibitions and sales fairs in Hong Kong, and to attract more overseas and Mainland yacht builders and manufacturers of yacht accessories to establish branch offices in Hong Kong, so as to promote the development of the yacht industry?

Reply:

President,

In response to the inquiry raised by the Hon Benson Luk, after consulting the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Security Bureau, the Development Bureau, the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau and the Marine Department (MD), the reply is as follows:

(1) The CSTB supports the development and co-operation of yacht tourism in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, with a view to expanding and promoting high value-added tourism activities in Hong Kong and demonstrating the role of Hong Kong as a core demonstration zone for multi-destination tourism. The MD and the Guangdong Maritime Safety Administration have established a dedicated task force to maintain discussion and co-operation on various issues relating to facilitation of yacht travelling, including the ""yacht free travel"" proposal put forward by Guangdong Province, and to jointly formulate relevant implementation measures.

(2) and (3) At present, visiting yachts (including those from the Mainland) entering Hong Kong waters are required to complete port formalities with the MD, the Immigration Department (ImmD), the Department of Health (DH) and the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department. Generally speaking, local agents would be appointed to handle all the port formalities in Hong Kong for visiting yachts. The MD has set up an electronic business system to provide one-stop service for visiting yachts, allowing them to submit the required documents to the MD, the ImmD and the DH through the online system in an efficient and convenient manner. At the same time, visiting yachts are currently not required to be anchored at an approved immigration anchorage whilst awaiting immigration clearance. The master of a visiting yacht, or its agent, is only required to complete the immigration procedures at the Harbour Control Section of the ImmD (which operates 24 hours every day) located at the Central Government Pier within 24 hours after entering into Hong Kong waters and before the intended departure from the Hong Kong waters. The aforementioned arrangements, which is not applicable to other visiting vessels, aim at simplifying and facilitating the immigration procedures for visiting yachts.

Relevant bureaux and departments will continue to review and improve the relevant arrangements, with a view to facilitating the formulation of a more holistic yacht industrial policy in the future.

(4) In accordance with international practice, foreign yachts must complete port formalities and obtain permission from local government authorities before navigating in local waters. Hong Kong is no exception.

Currently, visiting yachts wishing to navigate freely in Hong Kong waters must submit proof of securing a berth at a private yacht club or marina when applying for entry. Additionally, the yacht's crew members must not only meet the requirements of their country of registry but also pass a local port knowledge examination. The purpose of this examination is to ensure that crew members of visiting yachts are familiar with local fairways, anchorages, speed restriction zones, ferry routes, navigation aids, and other relevant information, thereby ensuring the safe navigation of the yacht within Hong Kong waters and the safety of other port users.

  The MD is exploring whether there is scope to relax requirements or introduce facilitation measures to enhance the navigation experience for visiting yachts in Hong Kong waters.

(5) The Transport and Logistics Bureau is pleased to collaborate with relevant departments and organisations to provide advice to the industry on the development of yacht exhibitions and sales. For example, over the past year, the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) has from time to time hosted large-scale events to brief the business community on the Airport City development blueprint Skytopia, which includes a yacht bay development offering over 500 berths. The AAHK has also participated in overseas yacht exhibitions and conferences, etc."

The case involved three unauthorised structures with a total area of about 1 354 square metres on three lots in D.D. 80, Lin Ma Hang, Sha Tau Kok. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without the prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), three removal orders were served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failing to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.

A spokesman for the BD said today (September 10), ""UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

（二）和（三）現時訪港遊樂船隻（包括內地遊艇）若要進入香港水域，須向海事處、入境事務處、衞生署和香港海關辦妥關務手續。一般而言，訪港遊樂船隻會委託香港本地代理辦理在港的關務手續。海事處設有電子業務系統，為訪港遊樂船隻提供一站式服務，讓他們省時便捷地透過網上系統向海事處、入境事務處和衞生署遞交所需文件。與此同時，現時訪港遊樂船隻無須碇泊於入境船隻認可碇泊處等候出入境檢查。船長或其代表只需在船隻進入香港水域後的24小時內，和預備離開香港水域的24小時前，前往24小時運作位於中區政府碼頭的入境事務處港口管制組辦理出入境手續。上述安排有別於其他訪港船隻，旨在簡化及便利遊樂船隻辦理出入境檢查的手續。

相關政策局和部門會持續檢視及完善有關安排，以在未來制訂更整全的遊艇產業政策。

（四）按國際慣例，外地遊艇均必須辦理關務手續，並獲當地政府部門許可，方可在當地水域航行，香港也不例外。

目前，訪港遊艇如欲在香港水域自由航行，須在辦理遊艇到港申請時提交證明文件，證實其已在私人遊艇會或碼頭取得泊位。另外，該遊艇操作人員的資歷除符合船旗國的要求外，亦須要通過本地港口知識考試，其目的是讓訪港遊艇的操作人員掌握本地的航道、錨地、航速限制區、渡輪航線、航標等知識，以確保該遊艇於香港水域內安全航行，並保障其他港口使用者的安全。

海事處正探討是否有空間放寬要求或探索安排便利措施，以便利訪港遊艇在香港水域航行。

（五）運輸及物流局樂意聯同各相關部門和機構，就遊艇展覽及銷售等方面的發展向業界提供意見。舉例來說，香港機場管理局（機管局）過去一年不時舉辦大型活動，向商界介紹機場城市發展藍圖「Skytopia」，當中包括發展提供逾500個遊艇泊位的遊艇港灣；機管局亦有參與海外遊艇展覽會議等。"
Speech by FS at 10th Belt and Road Summit Keynote Luncheon (English only) (with photos/video),2025-09-10 14:50,2025-09-10 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000523.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the 10th Belt and Road Summit Keynote Luncheon today (September 10):

Mr Fred Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, Mr Frederick Ma), Mr Chen Liang (Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Management Committee of the China International Capital Corporation Limited), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. Welcome to the keynote luncheon of the 10th Belt and Road Summit.

I am pleased that distinguished speakers have been lined up for this luncheon. Allow me to serve as your appetiser, by sharing briefly how Hong Kong is fostering more partnerships and contributing to regional connectivity through leveraging on two important global trends of our time: green and sustainable development, and digital innovation.

The case for green

In the face of rising unilateralism and the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement by a leading economy, Hong Kong remains steadfast in our commitment to climate action. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions by half by 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This commitment is underpinned by four key strategies: decarbonising power generation, enhancing energy efficiency in buildings, promoting green transport and reducing waste.

But our ambition extends well beyond meeting domestic targets. Two years ago, in my Budget Speech, I set out a vision for Hong Kong to become an international centre for green technology and green finance. We firmly believe that Hong Kong can play a pivotal role in driving global green transition.

Let me begin with green finance, where Hong Kong is already a regional leader. According to market estimates, emerging and developing Asia requires an annual investment of at least US$1.1 trillion for climate mitigation and adaptation. Yet, current investment levels fall short by over 70 per cent, at about US$800 billion. Clearly, we need to mobilise capital more effectively for sustainable investments.

In 2024, sustainable debt issuances in Hong Kong exceeded US$80 billion, with green bonds accounting for around 45 per cent of the region’s total. In the first half of 2025, we saw a 15 per cent year-on-year increase, at over US$34 billion. On ESG (environmental, social and governance), over 200 funds have been authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission, with AUM (asset under management) exceeding US$140 billion, up more than 30 per cent in just three years. The liquidity and expertise in Hong Kong are deep, and the capacity is huge.

Distinguished guests, our platform is fully open to issuers not just from the Chinese Mainland but also from around the world. Sovereign entities, corporates, financial institutions, multilateral organisations are all welcome. Hong Kong stands ready to collaborate with regional and global partners to scale up sustainable finance and channel capital to where it is needed most.

We are also making good progress in transition finance, which plays a vital role in helping high-emission industries decarbonise. On this, a key enabler is the development of clear and robust classification, reporting and disclosure standards.

To this end, we are working to expand the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance to incorporate transition finance, broaden sectoral coverage, and include climate adaptation activities. These enhancements aim to better guide capital flows toward credible climate initiatives and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

As an international financial centre, Hong Kong is deploying innovative financial instruments to address the diverse financing needs of emerging economies. Catastrophe (cat) bonds, for example, are valuable risk-transfer instruments for countries vulnerable to natural disasters. Since 2021, seven cat bonds have been issued in Hong Kong, totaling US$800 million, supporting countries across Asia and the Americas in sharing risks arising from typhoons and earthquakes with climate investors.

Another promising financial innovation is securitisation of infrastructure, which transforms brownfield infrastructure assets into investable products, thereby effectively unlocking capital for new greenfield projects. The Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation is a pioneer in this space. It has made two issuances of securitised loans, covering 35 infrastructure projects across 16 countries and regions, with a combined value exceeding US$800 million. This model mobilises more private capital for green initiatives in emerging markets while unleashing the investment potential of their infrastructure assets.

Hong Kong is also rapidly emerging as a dynamic hub for green technology innovation. Today, over 250 green tech companies are operating in Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport, developing cutting-edge solutions in areas such as carbon capture, electric vehicle infrastructure, and sustainable building materials.

Many of these technologies are already being deployed across Southeast Asia and the Middle East, contributing to their decarbonisation efforts. This vibrant ecosystem remains open to global partners who are united by the shared mission of building a more sustainable and resilient future.

Digital innovation

Now let me turn to digital innovation, another key driver of global development. Across Hong Kong and the Chinese Mainland, a wide spectrum of digital solutions are emerging, from fintech and smart health, to cloud computing, 6G, and digital city management.

What sets Hong Kong apart is our role as a bridge connecting the Chinese Mainland and the rest of the world. Solutions that succeed here carry a global seal of approval. Hong Kong is a trusted test bed for Chinese tech applications going global and vice versa. For Belt and Road economies and the Global South, Hong Kong offers not only access to cutting-edge technologies but also the assurance that they are fully aligned with the best international standards and practices.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a pivotal driving force behind digital innovation. Our country, China, has adopted an ""AI+"" strategy to promote digital transformation across industries. Here in Hong Kong, we share that vision. We have made AI one of our key strategic priorities, and are progressing at full speed on five key fronts: algorithms, data, computing power, capital and talent. At a time of intensifying technological fragmentation, we are committed to building an open, collaborative and inclusive AI community, and we invite global scientists and innovators to join us.

Blockchain technology is at the heart of financial innovation. Digital assets, such as tokenised deposits and bonds, are greatly improving the efficiency of financial transactions. Hong Kong is at the forefront of this development. We have issued two tranches of tokenised green bonds worth HK$6.8 billion, which were well received by the market. Recognising the value and importance of digital currency in cross-border applications, Hong Kong is an active participant in the mBridge Project, a pioneering central bank digital currencies initiative for cross-border settlements. Meanwhile, we have also introduced licensing regimes for digital asset exchanges and stablecoins. Adopting a prudent and risk-based approach, we encourage financial innovation to serve the real economy with guardrails to protect investors and the stability of financial systems. 

Closing

Ladies and gentlemen, I know I stand between you and your lunch, so I'll close by introducing our distinguished luncheon speaker, Mr Renat Bekturov, Governor of the Astana International Financial Centre. He joins us at a time when the collaboration between Hong Kong and Kazakhstan is growing stronger. Just two weeks ago, a leading mining company from Kazakhstan completed a dual listing in Hong Kong and the Astana International Exchange. It is the first Renminbi-denominated stock in Central Asia. Last week, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan also issued dim sum bonds of RMB2 billion here. It was also a pioneering move from a Central Asian government.

We are excited to hear Mr Bekturov's insights on Kazakhstan's latest developments, and how our two economies can collaborate more closely, build more partnerships and foster stronger connectivity.

On that note, I wish you a fortifying lunch, a fruitful Summit, and a most enjoyable stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."

Speech by Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services) at Climate Finance Forum: The Road to Net Zero (English only) (with photos),2025-09-10 14:48,2025-09-10 15:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000343.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Permanent Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury (Financial Services), Ms Salina Yan, at the Climate Finance Forum: The Road to Net Zero today (September 10):

Bonnie (Chief Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX), Ms Bonnie Chan), Dirk (President and Chief Executive Officer of the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), Mr Dirk Forrister), Mary (Vice Chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and Head of the GFANZ Secretariat, Ms Mary Schapiro), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my great pleasure to join you at the Climate Finance Forum this morning.

 A lot of pertinent views and initiatives for action have been raised for achieving net zero over the past two days of the Hong Kong Green Week 2025. Financing is a critical part of the formula. As an eminent fundraising platform, the HKEX is well placed to host a forum on such an important topic, drawing on the reflections from the International Carbon Markets Summit held in this very same venue earlier this year. As an international financial centre with openness to the world and the unique advantage of connecting with the Mainland market, Hong Kong is keen to bring together market participants, experts and policymakers to deepen the dialogue and foster collaboration on climate finance.

 Hong Kong is staying its course on the green and sustainable agenda even as world co-operation on this is being put to the test. The Government has made clear policy commitments and set out concrete action plans to advance our role as a green finance hub, encouraging efficient asset allocation, innovation and public and private partnership to build an enabling ecosystem along the way.

 For example, it is well noted that Hong Kong arranges 45 per cent of green and sustainable bonds done through the region, leading the Asian market. We also have over 200 authorised environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds with over HK$1.1 trillion AUM (assets under management), an increase of 18 per cent from three years ago.

 Added to these, we have introduced two batches of tokenised government green bonds, and are earnestly preparing for the third issuance. Our plan is to regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds.

 With the same innovative spirit and recognising the long R&D (research and development) cycles and capital-intensive nature of innovation, the HKEX has introduced a dedicated listing channel for specialist companies developing breakthrough technologies, including those focusing on new energy, advanced materials, and environmental protection.

 There has been an active stream of listings of electric vehicles (EV), EV supply chains, energy storage, and hydrogen energy on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The market capitalisation of the new energy sector now stands at US$806 billion, an impressive six-fold growth compared with that of 10 years ago and representing over 13 per cent of the total Hong Kong stock market. Without a doubt, the HKEX is now one of the world's largest EV fundraising/investment platforms.

 Talking about new energy, the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government has promulgated an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, setting out an ambitious target to develop Hong Kong into a premier green maritime fuel bunkering and trading centre. We are also promoting the application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Hong Kong International Airport and will announce an SAF consumption target within this year.

 With the setting up of the international carbon marketplace, Core Climate, for the trading of voluntary carbon credits, Hong Kong has taken one big step forward in advancing the carbon credit tool to encourage corporate decarbonisation. No doubt, Paul (Group General Counsel and Group Chief Sustainability Officer of the HKEX, Mr Paul Chow) will share with you more on this later this morning. For now, it is worth pointing out that Core Climate is currently the only carbon marketplace that offers Hong Kong Dollars and Renminbi settlement, and there has been substantial Belt and Road region participation in the 60-plus projects handled by Core Climate so far.

 Sustainability information disclosure provides the necessary transparency for the buy and sell sides as well as for general societal benefit. Last year, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau launched a Roadmap on Sustainability Disclosure in Hong Kong setting out the pathway for large publicly accountable entities to fully adopt the ISSB Standards (International Financial Reporting Standards - Sustainability Disclosure Standards) of disclosure. The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants has since published the Hong Kong Sustainability Disclosure Standards. In June 2025, Hong Kong was confirmed by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation as among the first set of jurisdictions having set a target of fully adopting the ISSB Standards. The HKEX acts even faster and became one of the first exchanges to update climate disclosure requirements in reference to IFRS S2.

 As part of the sustainability disclosure ecosystem, the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council plans to release a proposed local regulatory framework for sustainability assurance for public consultation within this year, covering issues such as the entities required to obtain assurance; the scope, timing as well as providers of assurance, etc. We look forward to the exchange of views at the Forum on Sustainability Disclosures this afternoon.

 Hong Kong is a steadfast believer in multilateral efforts and solutions. We are glad to have the presence of the International Emissions Trading Association and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero today. Through collaborations and concerted efforts, as well as empathy for the well-being of planet Earth, we have the potential to create a sustainable and resilient future, turning vision into action and reality. With these remarks, I wish all of you a fruitful Forum today. Thank you."
立法會十題：規管數字資產,2025-09-10 14:40,2025-09-10 14:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000346.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上譚岳衡議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

《穩定幣條例》（第656章）（《條例》）於上月一日生效後，非「認許提供者」不得向零售或專業投資者「要約提供」穩定幣。但據報虛擬資產場外交易（OTC）機構（包括找換店）目前不屬於《條例》下的認許提供者，令部分OTC機構可以利用《條例》的灰色地帶（例如以被動交易方式或客戶主動報價）繼續運營，規避《條例》監管，因而為投資者帶來風險及增加行業不確定性。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）針對上述非認許提供者規避《條例》監管的行為，政府現時有何措施預防、應對和監管；會否發布具體指引或例子，以進一步釐清何為《條例》中未明確定義的交易或營運行為；

（二）據報在現時的監管框架下，散戶投資者可能轉以不受《條例》監管的離岸平台交易或利用點對點交易，令他們需承擔更高的投資風險，政府將如何平衡嚴格監管與市場需求，包括完善監管制度、加快發牌審批、加強投資者教育，或擴大可交易資產範圍（例如合規穩定幣）等，以保障散戶投資者的利益；及

（三）鑑於政府於今年六月就設立數字資產交易及託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議發布諮詢文件，制訂該發牌制度的工作進展及立法時間表為何；如有立法時間表，詳情為何；如沒有立法時間表，原因為何？

答覆：

主席︰

《穩定幣條例》（第656章）（《條例》）已於二○二五年八月一日實施，其中一個目的是監管指明穩定幣的發行及限制可要約提供指明穩定幣的人士，以保障指明穩定幣持有人及潛在持有人。

就問題的各部分，經諮詢香港金融管理局（金管局）及證券及期貨事務監察委員會（證監會），現答覆如下：

（一）根據《條例》第9條，目前只有「認許提供者」可要約提供指明穩定幣。現時，《條例》指明五類「認許提供者」，分別為（一）持牌的穩定幣發行人、（二）由證監會發牌的虛擬資產服務提供者、（三）持有儲值支付工具牌照的人士、（四）獲證監會發牌進行第1類受規管活動的法團，及（五）認可機構。「認許提供者」可以向零售投資者和專業投資者要約提供由受金管局監管的持牌發行人發行的穩定幣（受監管的穩定幣）；至於非受監管的穩定幣，只可向專業投資者（根據《證券及期貨條例》（第571章）附表1第1部第1條的定義）要約提供。

虛擬資產場外交易機構目前不屬《條例》下的「認許提供者」，因此不能向零售或專業投資者要約提供指明穩定幣（不論該穩定幣是否受監管）。

《條例》實施初期，金管局會通過加強宣傳，加深業界對《條例》的認識，促使業界遵守《條例》的相關要求。同時，金管局會監察市面上涉及穩定幣交易的情況，如果發現有涉嫌違反《條例》的行為，會根據相關事實和證據，考慮進一步跟進行動。

（二）如上文所述，根據《條例》規定，目前只有「認許提供者」可要約提供指明穩定幣。公眾必須留意，目前金管局尚未向任何穩定幣發行人發出牌照。公眾向《條例》指明的「認許提供者」購買受監管穩定幣，才會受到《條例》的保障。假如公眾透過非受監管的渠道購買穩定幣，或購買任何非受監管的穩定幣，須自行承擔風險。

金管局會透過不同渠道，包括社交媒體平台，持續進行公眾教育，以加深公眾對《條例》的認識。

（三）財經事務及庫務局（財庫局）於二○二五年六月發表的《香港數字資產發展政策宣言2.0》表明，優化法律與監管是推動數字資產行業發展的其中一個重點。政府及金融監管機構會繼續秉持「相同業務、相同風險、相同規則」的原則，強調風險為本，持續優化和建立一套既切合本地情況，又依循國際標準和慣例的監管制度，為香港數字資產市場健康、負責任和可持續發展提供穩固基礎。

財庫局與證監會剛於二○二五年六月二十七日至八月二十九日期間，就數字資產交易及託管服務提供者發牌制度的立法建議進行了公眾諮詢。財庫局與證監會正參考公眾諮詢所得的意見，制訂相關發牌制度的細節，並將適時公布立法時間表。"
LCQ10: Regulation of digital assets,2025-09-10 14:40,2025-09-10 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000338.htm," Following is a question by Dr the Hon Tan Yueheng and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

 Since the Stablecoins Ordinance (Cap. 656) (the Ordinance) came into effect on the first of last month, non-permitted offerors have been prohibited from offering stablecoins to retail or professional investors. However, it has been reported that as virtual asset over-the-counter (OTC) trading institutions (including money changers) are currently not classified as permitted offerors under the Ordinance, some OTC trading institutions can take advantage of the grey areas of the Ordinance, such as through passive trading or customer-initiated quotes, to continue operation while circumventing the Ordinance, hence posing risks to investors and increasing industry uncertainty. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the current measures in place to prevent, address, and regulate the aforesaid circumvention of the Ordinance by non-permitted offerors; whether it will release specific guidelines or examples to further clarify what constitute transactions or operational activities that are not explicitly defined in the Ordinance;

(2) as it has been reported that under the current regulatory framework, retail investors may switch to trading on offshore platforms not regulated by the Ordinance or using P2P transactions, hence subjecting them to higher investment risks, how the Government will strike a balance between strict regulation and market demand, including improving the regulatory regime, expediting licensing approvals, strengthening investor education, and broadening the scope of tradable assets (e.g. compliant stablecoins), to protect the interests of retail investors; and

(3) given that the Government issued a consultation paper in June this year on legislative proposals for regulating digital asset dealing and custodian services, of the progress of the establishment of the licensing regime and the legislative timetable; if there is a legislative timetable, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 The Stablecoins Ordinance (Cap. 656) (Ordinance) came into effect on August 1, 2025. One of its purposes is to regulate the issue of specified stablecoins and impose restrictions on the persons who may offer specified stablecoins, with a view to protecting holders and potential holders of specified stablecoins.

 After consultation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the reply to the various parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Under section 9 of the Ordinance, currently only ""permitted offerors"" may offer specified stablecoins. At present, the Ordinance specifies five types of ""permitted offerors"", namely (1) licensed stablecoin issuers; (2) virtual asset service providers licensed by the SFC; (3) persons with a stored value facility licence; (4) corporations licensed by the SFC to conduct Type 1 regulated activities; and (5) authorised institutions. ""Permitted offerors"" may offer stablecoins issued by licensed issuers regulated by the HKMA (i.e. regulated stablecoins) to both retail and professional investors; however, unregulated stablecoins may only be offered to professional investors (as defined in section 1 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571)).

 Virtual asset over-the-counter (OTC) trading institutions are not ""permitted offerors"" under the Ordinance, and therefore cannot offer specified stablecoins to retail or professional investors, regardless of whether such stablecoins are regulated.

 During the initial implementation of the Ordinance, the HKMA will step up publicity efforts to enhance the industry's understanding of the Ordinance and promote the industry's compliance with its relevant requirements. At the same time, the HKMA will monitor transactions involving stablecoin in the market. If a suspected contravention of the Ordinance is identified, the HKMA will consider follow-up action based on the relevant facts and evidence.

(2) As mentioned above, under the Ordinance, currently only ""permitted offerors"" are permitted to offer specified stablecoins. Members of the public must note that the HKMA has not licensed any stablecoin issuer yet. While the Ordinance offers protection to members of the public who purchase regulated stablecoins from ""permitted offerors"" as specified in the Ordinance, members of the public who acquire stablecoins through unregulated channels or acquire any unregulated stablecoins will have to bear their own risk.

 The HKMA will continue to conduct public education through various channels, including social media platforms, to enhance public understanding of the Ordinance.

(3) In the ""Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong"" issued in June 2025, the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) has made clear that enhancing the legal and regulatory framework is one of the key focuses in promoting the development of the digital asset sector. Guided by the principle of ""same activity, same risks, same regulation"" under a risk-based approach, the Government and financial regulators will continue to enhance and establish a regulatory framework that reflects local circumstances and aligns with international standards and practices, with a view to providing a solid foundation for the healthy, responsible and sustainable development of the digital asset market in Hong Kong.

 The FSTB and the SFC recently conducted a public consultation on the legislative proposals for the licensing regimes for digital asset dealing and custodian service providers from June 27 to August 29, 2025. The FSTB and the SFC are formulating details of the licensing regimes based on the views received from the public consultation, and will announce the legislative timetable in due course."
立法會十二題：優化跨境匯款安排,2025-09-10 14:15,2025-09-10 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025090900713.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上梁子穎議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

（四）每間銀行的跨境支付服務規模和操作模式不盡相同，各銀行會按自身的情況釐定有關服務的手續費結構和水平，此屬銀行的商業決定。然而，銀行在提供跨境支付服務時，應遵從《銀行營運守則》，當中包括向客戶提供相關服務的詳情，如有關服務的基本資料、匯出款項的匯率基準、客戶須支付予銀行的任何手續費或收費詳情、以及境外代理銀行收取的手續費或收費（如有）。金管局期望透過保持跨境支付服務收費的透明度，促進市場的競爭。

就金錢服務經營者方面，由於它們的經營模式及運作情況不盡相同，業界並沒有劃一的匯款手續費結構。

（五）根據現時內地法規，香港居民在內地用於旅遊、商務、留學、日常生活、贍家等支出一般可以透過銀行辦理跨境匯款。在資金用途符合規定的情況下，如選用人民幣進行匯款，在現行安排下香港居民每人每日有八萬元人民幣額度匯款至同名賬戶。如選用其他非人民幣幣種（包括港元），收款人每人每年有等值五萬美元的結匯便利化額度。若收款人能提供材料證明匯款真實合規，政策上亦容許香港居民在銀行直接辦理匯款到內地的業務，不佔用以上提到的額度。

近年在兩地金融管理部門和業界的努力下，我們積極推出個人匯款便利化安排，包括二○二四年初推出的粵港澳大灣區內地城市購房支付便利化安排，方便香港居民將購房相關款項通過兩地銀行體系匯入內地。今年六月二十二日，金管局和中國人民銀行推出「跨境支付通」，香港居民可以經香港的參與機構使用轉數快進行即時小額的跨境匯款。

我們留意部分市民期望跨境匯款安排可進一步優化，便利在內地常住的香港居民進行生活配套環節相關的跨境交易，例如出入起居、醫療保健、退休養老等活動。我們正與內地金融部門積極探討在不同場景下推出更多金融便民措施。

（六）在公眾教育宣傳方面，金管局於今年初在網站發布常見問題集，解說在不同跨境匯款場景下內地現行的政策安排，並介紹現有兩地銀行和儲值支付工具提供的匯款及支付產品服務。金管局隨後進行銀行業界簡報會，討論落實安排，並提醒各銀行在處理客戶查詢時，確保前線人員知悉相關的政策安排並回應客戶的查詢。

此外，香港海關亦十分重視保障消費者的權益，不時透過多種途徑，如新聞公報、社交媒體宣傳合法合規的找換及匯款服務，並提醒消費者在選擇匯款服務時，應考慮整體因素，包括金錢服務經營者的交付渠道、商譽等，並注意匯款存在的風險。香港海關亦積極向不同社群提供宣傳及教育講座，如二○二四年至二○二五年六月期間，香港海關就「補充勞工優化計劃」為超過21 000名新來港的工作的勞工舉辦了超過160場講座，向他們講解使用匯款服務時所需注意事項。

（七）《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集條例》（第615章）訂立了金錢服務經營者的發牌制度，賦權香港海關對金錢服務經營者的合規情況進行監管。

在現行的發牌制度下，金錢服務經營者在申請牌照或續牌時，必須符合適當人選的要求，以及向香港海關提交業務計劃，當中需要闡述其營運模式和其合理性、明確披露資金流向和交付渠道，以及具備有效合宜的打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集措施及日常營運監察機制。透過上述的發牌要求，香港海關能有效評估和監察不同營運模式和規模的金錢服務經營者的相關風險。

香港海關非常重視金錢服務業提供匯款服務的合規情況，並一直採取不同措施確保金錢服務經營者以適當方式處理客戶的款項及完成相關交易。其中，香港海關已制訂《金錢服務經營者牌照指引》及《打擊洗錢及恐怖分子資金籌集指引》，確保持牌金錢服務經營者遵從客戶盡職審查、備存紀錄、妥善處理客戶款項及其他發牌規定。對於業務有較高風險的金錢服務經營者（例如客戶性質、產品、服務、交易或交付渠道等因素），香港海關亦會施加特定的牌照條件以加強監管。香港海關將繼續留意市場發展，並適時檢視金錢服務業相關監察機制的要求。"
LCQ12: Enhancement of cross-boundary remittance arrangements,2025-09-10 14:15,2025-09-10 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025090900719.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Dennis Leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

 There are views pointing out that the demand for cross-boundary remittances between Hong Kong and the Mainland is increasing, yet restrictions on remittance limits and channel regulation remain imperfect. Regarding the enhancement of cross-boundary remittance arrangements, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on (i) the number of agencies providing cross-boundary remittance services between Hong Kong and the Mainland, (ii) the total amount of remittance involved, and (iii) the total amount of banks' revenue from the provision of the relevant cross-boundary remittance services under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme in each of the years between January 2016 and June 2025 (set out in Table 1‍);

Table 1

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the respective numbers of (a) ‍transactions and (b) remittances in total (including telegraphic transfers) from Hong Kong to the Mainland (northbound) through banks by (i) individuals and (ii) ‍institutions in each year from January 2019 to June 2025 (set out in Table 2);

(3) whether the Government has requested that remittance agencies compile statistics on the use of remittances by individuals/institutions; if so, of the details (including a breakdown of the data on the use of remittances); if not, whether it will request that remittance agencies compile the relevant data and standardise the category of the relevant uses;

(4) whether it has compiled statistics on the remittance handling fee structure (including the actual fee charged for each remittance) of the various legal and authorised remittance agencies (such as banks) providing northbound cross-boundary remittance services in Hong Kong and the Mainland to individuals from January 2019 to June 2025, as well as the total amount of proceeds earned from remittance services provided by such agencies;

(5) as there are views that the Mainland's facilitative foreign exchange arrangement subject to an annual quota of US$50,000 per person has not been adjusted in light of market developments, whether the Government has plans to discuss with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange the adjustment of this quota against the background of the ongoing deepening of the financial co-operation between Hong Kong and the Mainland as well as the joint promotion of cross-boundary financial interconnection and mutual access in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area;

(6) whether the Government will consider encouraging banks to adjust their fees and charges for cross-boundary remittances and stepping up public education and publicity to encourage members of the public to remit money through legal and compliant channels; if not, of the reasons for that; and

(7) whether it will consider further regulating the operations of non-‍banking agencies involved in cross-boundary remittance services (e.g. money changers, etc), including requiring such agencies to transfer fund through legal and compliant channels, and setting up mechanisms on minimum capital requirements, risk reserve standards and daily operational monitoring; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

 In consultation with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the Customs and Excise Department (C&ED), my reply to the seven parts of the question is as follows:

(1) Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors are foreign institutional investors approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to use funds from outside mainland China to invest in domestic securities and futures. We do not maintain relevant data of the number of agencies, the total amount of remittance, and the total amount of banks' revenue from the provision of the relevant cross-boundary remittance services.

(2) The figures of Renminbi (RMB) cross-boundary remittance transactions from Hong Kong to the Mainland (including individual and non-individual remitters) are as follows:

(3) As the regulator of banks in Hong Kong, the HKMA has been collecting different scope of data from banks, for the purpose of conducting risk assessments and continuous monitoring on banks' business.

 In respect of RMB remittance business of banks in Hong Kong, besides the statistics on cross-boundary remittance transactions set out above, the HKMA also regularly releases banks' RMB remittance for trade settlement business, with relevant data as below:




Year

			(RMB billion)

2025 (January to June)

(4) There are different scales and operational models of the cross-boundary payment services across banks. Individual banks would set their fee structure and level for the services according to the bank's own circumstances as a commercial decision of the banks. Nonetheless, banks should comply with the relevant requirements of the Code of Banking Practice when providing cross-boundary payment services. These include, among other things, providing for customers details of the services they offer, such as a basic description of the service; the basis on which exchange rates will be applied; details of any commission or charges payable by customers to the bank; and other commission or charges levied by correspondent banks outside Hong Kong (if available). By maintaining transparency of the fees charged by banks in providing cross-boundary payment services, the HKMA hopes to enhance competition in this market segment.

 As for money service operators, since their business models and operational circumstances vary, there is no uniform fee structure for remittance services across the industry.

(5) According to the prevailing Mainland regulations, Hong Kong residents can in general remit funds to the Mainland through banks for spending or expenses related to travel, business trips, study abroad, daily life, and family support, etc. Within this scope, if the remittances are made in RMB, Hong Kong residents can transfer funds to their same-name bank accounts on the Mainland, subject to a daily limit of RMB80,000, under the existing arrangements. If the remittances are made in non-RMB currencies (including HKD), there is a facilitative arrangement available for individual recipients, subject to an annual quota equivalent to USD50,000. If the recipients can provide supporting documents to confirm genuineness of the remittances, the policy also allows Hong Kong residents to make cross-boundary remittances to the Mainland without utilising the aforementioned limits.

 With the efforts of financial regulators and the industry in Hong Kong and the Mainland in recent years, we have introduced various facilitative arrangements on personal cross-boundary remittance. In early 2024, facilitation arrangements for remittances were introduced to facilitate Hong Kong residents purchasing properties in the Mainland cities of theGuangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to remit funds related to property purchases to the Mainland through the banking system. The HKMA and the People's Bank of China launched Payment Connect on June 22 this year. Hong Kong residents can make real-time and small-value cross-boundary remittances at participating institutions in Hong Kong via Faster Payment System.

 We notice that some citizens wish for further enhancement to cross-boundary remittance arrangements to facilitate cross-boundary transactions relating to their everyday life on the Mainland, for example, transportation and living, medical services, retirement and elderly care, etc. We are engaging with Mainland authorities to explore further facilitative measures under different scenarios.

(6) In respect of public education, the HKMA released a set of FAQs on the website at the beginning of this year, explaining the current Mainland policy arrangements under different scenarios on cross-boundary remittance, and introducing the remittance and payment products provided by banks and stored value payment facilities in Hong Kong and the Mainland. Subsequently the HKMA held an industry briefing with banks to discuss the implementation arrangements, and reminded banks to ensure that frontline staff are aware of the relevant policy arrangements and handle clients' inquiries accordingly.

 The C&ED places great importance on safeguarding consumer rights. It regularly promotes legally compliant money changing and remittance services through various channels, such as press releases and social media, and reminds consumers to consider a range of factors (including the delivery channels and reputation of the money service operators (MSOs)) in a comprehensive manner when choosing remittance services, as well as to be aware of the risks associated with remittance. The C&ED also actively provides promotional and educational talks to different communities. For example, between 2024 and June 2025, the C&ED conducted over 160 talks for over 21 000 workers newly arrived in Hong Kong under the Enhanced Supplementary Labour Scheme, educating them on points to note when using remittance services.

(7) The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (Cap. 615) (AMLO) provides for a licensing regime for MSOs, empowering the C&ED to supervise their compliance.

 Under the current licensing system, when applying for a licence or licence renewal, MSOs must meet the ""fit and proper"" test, and submit a business plan to the C&ED. This plan must explain their operating model and its rationale, clearly disclose the flow of funds and delivery channels, and demonstrate the existence of effective and appropriate anti-money laundering and terrorist financing measures and a daily operational monitoring mechanism. Through these licensing requirements, the C&ED can effectively assess and monitor the risks associated with MSOs of different operating models and sizes.

 The C&ED attaches great importance to the compliance of the money service industry in providing remittance services and has consistently taken various measures to ensure that MSOs handle customer funds and complete relevant transactions in an appropriate manner. Among these, the C&ED has formulated the ""Money Service Operators Licensing Guide"" and the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism"" to ensure licensed MSOs comply with customer due diligence, record-keeping, proper handling of customer funds, and other licensing requirements. For MSOs with higher risk profiles (due to factors such as customer nature, products, services, transactions, or delivery channels), the C&ED may also impose specific licence conditions to strengthen supervision. The C&ED will continue to monitor market developments and review the requirements of the relevant regulatory mechanisms for the money service industry."
立法會四題：人口政策規劃和資源分配,2025-09-10 14:11,2025-09-10 14:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000285.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上梁毓偉議員的提問和勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡的答覆：

問題：

根據政府統計處發布的二○二五年年中人口數字，香港受惠於各項吸引人才措施，整體人口呈輕微增長。另一方面，社會亦關注外來人口融入社會，以及有關的社會資源分配問題。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去三年及本年至今，每年各項人才入境計劃中以受養人身分來港的人數為何；當局有否推算未來數年因該等計劃而可能增加的人口數目；

（二）據悉近年經各項人才入境計劃來港的外來人口達數以十萬，當局有何措施協調教育、醫療、住屋以至就業等方面的政策及配套安排，以滿足本地及外來人口的需要；會否加強對輸入人才的追蹤調研和分析，以優化各項人才入境計劃的成效；及

（三）在制訂新一輪輸入人才政策的指標時，政府會否同時考慮相關人才入境計劃對人口結構的整體影響，並從高層次及宏觀角度制訂政策規劃和分配公共資源；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

政府統計處（統計處）每五年定期編製最新人口推算，以掌握推算期內香港人口的變化趨勢，從而為政府在各方面的政策及資源分配上的規劃提供基礎。

為應對人口高齡化帶來的人力需求挑戰，政府於二○二二年年底推出一系列措施積極招攬世界人才。過去數年，外來人才陸續抵港，部份更攜同家眷來港落戶，抵銷了人口自然減少的影響，有效緩解本地生育率長期偏低及人口高齡化所帶來的挑戰。二○二五年年中的人口較二○二二年年中增加超過十八萬人。此外，這些生力軍亦扭轉了本地勞動人口在疫情期間的跌勢，當中大部分更處於職涯上的黃金年齡，有助進一步豐富本地人才庫，提升香港的整體競爭力。香港在國際管理發展學院昨日發布的《2025年世界人才排名》中位列亞洲第一，全球排名由去年的第九位躍升至第四位，歷來最高，足證本屆政府推出的一系列「搶人才」措施方向正確，成效顯著。

就議員的提問，經諮詢教育局、醫務衞生局、房屋局、統計處和入境事務處（入境處）後，現答覆如下：

（一）截至二○二五年八月底，各項人才入境計劃已吸引超過23‍萬名人才抵港，當中部分攜同配偶及18歲以下未婚的受養子女來港。二○二三年起，各項人才入境計劃下累計有近22萬名人士以受‍養人身分來港。按人才入境計劃的分項數目載於附件。

勞工及福利局（勞褔局）和統計處分別於二○二四年及二○二三年公布最新的人力推算和人口推算。兩項推算均已經顧及主要人才入境計劃的影響。勞褔局現正開展人力推算的中期更新工作，綜合評估環球及本地最新發展（包括政府最新的人力政策及措施）對二○二八年人力情況的影響，預計在二○二六年第四季公布結果。另一方面，統計處將於二○二六年進行人口普查，搜集本港人口的最新基準資料，並會於普查結果備妥後，綜合屆時可知有關生育、死亡及人口遷移的最新數據和政策因素，更新人口推算。

（二）及（三）目前人口政策措施已融入各政策局的工作，成為恆常政策的一部分。相關政策局不時檢視其負責的措施的執行情況及成效，並跨局相互協作，因應社會、人口和人力最新情況策劃及推行不同的政策措施，例如：教育局會不時檢視教育政策，切合社會需要；醫務衞生局會繼續深化醫療體系改革，包括強化基層醫療促進健康和疾病預防，致力推展公營醫療收費改革，並提高私營醫療服務收費透明度，鼓勵善用醫療保險，確保香港醫療體系行穩致遠；房屋局會繼續密切留意各類房屋的供求情況，並適時作出相應的政策調整。行政長官、司長和副司長亦會按需要透過不同委員會、工作組和跨部門會議等不同形式提供高層次督導，統籌跨部門的相關工作，按本地人口及各行業人力情況的變化，持續檢視相關措施的執行情況及成效，並適時調整，以滿足香港經濟及社會發展的需要。

在人力資源規劃方面，政府會因應社會發展和人力需求趨勢優化本地培訓、「搶人才」和「留人才」措施，按情況訂立相應績效指標。事實上，政府一直在獲批人才首次入境及申請續簽時收集他們在港的就業情況，而勞福局轄下的香港人才服務辦公室亦與來港人才保持密切聯繫，線上線下了解和跟進他們在香港的發展及需要，並提供支援。就本屆政府嶄新推出的高端人才通行證計劃而言，勞福局更會在入境處發出續期簽證時邀請申請人參與跟進調查，以了解獲批續簽的高才在住屋、受養子女教育等方面的情況。首批跟進調查結果及續簽情況上月已公布。勞福局會繼續經不同途徑了解來港人才在港落戶的情況，作為持續優化輸入人才政策及支援服務的參考。

多謝主席。"
LCQ4: Population policy planning and resource allocation,2025-09-10 14:11,2025-09-10 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000286.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Kenneth Leung and a reply by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  According to the statistics of mid-year population for 2025 released by the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong's overall population has shown slight growth, benefiting from various measures on talent attraction. On the other hand, society is also concerned about the integration of immigrants and the related issues of social resource allocation. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of persons who came to Hong Kong as dependants under various talent admission schemes in each of the past three years and this year to date; whether the authorities have projected the potential increase in population in the coming years as a result of such schemes;

(2) as it is learnt that in recent years, hundreds of thousands of immigrants have come to Hong Kong through various talent admission schemes, of the measures put in place by the authorities to co-ordinate policies and supporting arrangements in areas such as education, healthcare, housing and employment to meet the needs of both the local and immigrant populations; whether tracking surveys and studies and analysis of admitted talents will be strengthened so as to optimise the effectiveness of various talent admission schemes; and

(3) when formulating the indicators for the new round of talent admission policies, whether the Government will simultaneously consider the overall impact of the relevant talent admission schemes on the population structure, and formulate policy planning and allocate public resources from a high-level and macro perspective; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) compiles new population projection every five years to understand the trend of change in Hong Kong's population during the projection period so as to provide the basis for the Government's planning in various policy areas and resource allocation.

  To address the challenges in manpower demand brought by an ageing population, the Government implemented in end-2022 a package of measures to proactively trawl for talents from around the world. In recent years, outside talents gradually arrived in Hong Kong, with some bringing along their families to settle in Hong Kong. This has offset the impact of natural population decrease and effectively alleviating the challenges caused by the persistently low local birth rate and the ageing of the population. The overall population in mid-2025 has increased by over 180 000 compared to mid-2022. In addition, the arrival of these incoming talents has reversed the decline in the local labour force during the pandemic, and the majority of them are in the prime years of their careers. This further enriches the local talent pool and enhances Hong Kong's overall competitiveness. Hong Kong ranked first in Asia in the World Talent Ranking 2025 published yesterday by the International Institute for Management Development, leaping markedly to fourth globally from ninth last year and marking the highest-ever ranking. This is clear evidence that the series of talent attraction measures implemented by the current-term Government are in the right direction and yielding significant results.

  In consultation with the Education Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Housing Bureau, the C&SD, and the Immigration Department (ImmD), my reply to the Member's question is as follows:

(1) As at end-August 2025, the various talent admission schemes have attracted over 230 000 talents arriving in Hong Kong. Some brought along to Hong Kong their spouses and unmarried dependent children under the age of 18. Nearly 220 000 individuals have arrived in Hong Kong as dependants under the various talent admission schemes since 2023. A breakdown of the relevant statistics by talent admission scheme is at Annex.

  The Labour and Welfare Bureau (LWB) and the C&SD published the latest manpower projection and population projection in 2024 and 2023 respectively. These projections have taken into account the impact of the major talent admission schemes. The LWB is now conducting a mid-term update of the manpower projection, which will comprehensively assess the implications of the latest global and local developments (including the Government's latest manpower policies and measures) on the manpower situation in 2028. The results are expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2026. On the other hand, the C&SD will conduct a population census in 2026 to obtain up-to-date benchmark information of the Hong Kong population. When the census results become available, the C&SD will update the population projection upon integrating the available data then about fertility, mortality and population movement with the prevailing policy factors.

(2) and (3) Currently, population policy measures have been subsumed under the portfolios of various bureaux as part of the ongoing efforts. The relevant policy bureaux are regularly reviewing the implementation and effectiveness of the measures under their purviews, performing their respective duties with cross-bureau collaboration so as to formulate and implement various policy measures in response to the latest social, demographic and manpower conditions. For instance, the Education Bureau will review education policies from time to time, with a view to meeting the needs of society. The Health Bureau will continue to deepen the reform of the healthcare system, including strengthening health promotion and disease prevention in primary healthcare; implementing reform on fees and charges for public healthcare; as well as enhancing the price transparency of private healthcare services, and encouraging better use of medical insurance to ensure the viability of Hong Kong's healthcare system. The Housing Bureau will continue to closely monitor the supply and demand of different types of housing and adjust the corresponding policies in a timely manner. The Chief Executive, and Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of Departments are providing high-level steer as necessary through various channels, such as committees, working groups and inter-departmental meetings, to co-ordinate relevant inter-departmental work in light of changes in the local demography and manpower situation in various industries, continuously review the implementation and effectiveness of relevant measures and make timely adjustments, so as to meet Hong Kong's economic and social development needs.

  As regards human resources planning, the Government will enhance the measures on local training, talent attraction and retention, in response to the trends of social development and manpower demand, and set corresponding key performance indicators as appropriate. In fact, the Government has been consistently collecting information on the employment situation of talents approved for admission upon their first entries and at the time of their applications for extension of stay. The Hong Kong Talent Engage under the LWB also maintains close contact with incoming talents to understand and keep track of their development and needs in Hong Kong through both online and offline channels, and provide support services. In respect of the Top Talent Pass Scheme (TTPS) newly launched by the current-term Government, the LWB will further invite applicants to participate in follow-up surveys when the ImmD issues their visas for extension of stay, in order to gather information on such areas as housing and education for dependent children of the TTPS talents approved for extension of stay. The first round of findings of the follow-up surveys and the situation of the extension of stay were released last month. The LWB will continue to keep in view the settlement of incoming talents in Hong Kong through various channels, and use the information as reference for the ongoing enhancement of talent admission policies and support services.

  Thank you, President."
LCQ20: Reclamation project for Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands,2025-09-10 13:08,2025-09-10 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000386.htm,"âFollowing is a question by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Development, Ms Bernadette Linn, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Special Administrative Region Government has earlier on indicated that the Government would first concentrate its efforts on pressing ahead the development of the Northern Metropolis, while the pace to take forward the reclamation project for the Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands (KYCAI project) could be slowed down. Nevertheless, the authorities would prudently complete the necessary preparatory work in the study stage. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that in the reply to a question raised by a Member of this Council on the Estimates of Expenditure for the financial year 2025-2026, the Government indicated that the Civil Engineering and Development Department was reviewing and fine-tuning the relevant background information and project description in the Environmental Impact Assessment report for the KYCAI project, and would make the report available for public inspection in a timely manner, of the latest progress of the relevant work;

(2) of the studies being undertaken by the Government on the KYCAI project which seek to ensure that the construction works of the project can be commenced swiftly at appropriate times in the future; and

(3) whether a development timetable has been drawn up for the KYCAI project at present; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  Land production takes time, involving various aspects of planning and studies, as well as the implementation of various land and infrastructure projects. It is the Government's responsibility to plan ahead and lead land development with a long-term perspective, ensuring that adequate land is supplied in a timely manner to support Hong Kong's long-term economic development and people's livelihood needs. The Government is also keenly aware that land has to be rolled out in a gradual and pragmatic manner, taking into account a basket of factors, including, inter alia, the market economic conditions. Having carefully reviewed these factors, the Government publicly stated earlier this year that it will currently focus on developing the Northern Metropolis. The Kau Yi Chau Artificial Islands (Kau Yi Chau) project, as another major land development project, is accorded a lower priority. However, the Government will continue with the studies already commenced on the Kau Yi Chau project.

  The replies to the various parts of the question raised by Dr the Hon Lo Wai-kwok are as follows:

(1) The Kau Yi Chau project is currently in its early planning and study stage. The Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) submitted the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIA Report) relating to the reclamation to the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) on December 31 last year. Although the EPD subsequently informed the CEDD that the EIA Report was suitable for public inspection, given that the implementation programme of the Kau Yi Chau project has been slowed down and no specific arrangements have been made, the Development Bureau, after reviewing the situation, considers it inappropriate to proceed with the relevant statutory EIA procedures (including public inspection, submission of the EIA Report to the Advisory Council on the Environment, and consideration by the Director of Environmental Protection for the approval of the EIA Report) at this stage. Proceeding with the above procedures without a target reclamation timetable could hinder focused discussion and arouse public concerns about the relevance of the approval results after a period of time. To avoid unnecessary public speculation and debate on the Kau Yi Chau project, we recommend adopting a more prudent arrangement. This involves waiting until the implementation timetable for the reclamation works is mostly ascertained and the EIA Report is updated as needed before submitting the EIA Report to the EPD, as well as exhibiting it for public inspection and seeking approval.

(2) The Kau Yi Chau project is a source of long-term land supply. Therefore, although there is no concrete timetable for its implementation, the analysis and information obtained from the ongoing studies are particularly crucial for the future implementation of the project. Such information remains applicable and retains significant reference value, which will help expedite the commencement of the Kau Yi Chau project when conditions permit. Currently, the Government will continue to complete the ongoing studies, including ground investigation, preliminary design of reclamation and major transportation infrastructure, and technical assessments related to land development. Even after these studies are completed, further studies, particularly detailed engineering design, will be required before progressing to the reclamation phase. However, the studies already undertaken form a good basis for us to commence other necessary preparatory work at the appropriate time.

(3) In view of the situation mentioned above, the Government has not yet formulated a timetable for the implementation of the Kau Yi Chau project. In fact, we do not have the necessary conditions for the reclamation project to be carried out within this term of Government."
LCQ3: Improving procurement processes of Government and public organisations,2025-09-10 13:05,2025-09-10 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000370.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shang Hailong and a reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It has been reported that a government department was recently found to have serious oversights and deficiencies in implementing its procurement process. There are views that the incident reflects the Government's failure to exercise rigorous supervision at the implementation level. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) how it will step up supervision of government departments' procurement processes to ensure strict adherence to procurement guidelines; whether it will introduce more frequent third-party audits or digital monitoring systems to promptly identify and rectify anomalies in procurement processes;

(2) when reviewing the existing procurement processes, whether it will consider optimising aspects such as contract management, supplier performance evaluation and price-quality balancing mechanisms, introducing more flexible and competitive procurement models (e.g. electronic tendering or dynamic pricing systems), and enhancing the transparency of procurement information (e.g. regularly submitting summaries of government departments' procurement contracts and supplier ratings to this Council, so that this Council can more effectively monitor the procurement processes); and

(3) whether it will formulate clearer operational guidelines on procurement for public organisations (e.g. the Hospital Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Authority), and provide regular training and technical support to reduce procurement issues arising from errors in implementation details?

Reply:

President,

  Government bureaux and departments (hereafter referred to as ""departments"") procure a wide variety of goods and services, ranging from common goods and professional items (e.g. pharmaceuticals and testing equipment) to service contracts (e.g. management of elderly homes and street cleansing). Having regard to society's concern over individual government procurement exercises recently, the question raised by the Hon Shang Hailong provides a good opportunity for me to elaborate on the government procurement regime:

(1) and (2) The Government's procurement policy is to obtain goods and services at the best value for money through fair, open and competitive procurement procedures. Meanwhile, the Stores and Procurement Regulations (SPRs) and relevant circulars set out the procurement framework and provide detailed guidelines on procurement procedures.

  Indeed, not all government procurement exercises are handled by the Government Logistics Department (GLD). In general, GLD supplies commonly used items to departments and procures goods for departments at a value exceeding $10 million, whereas respective departments are responsible for procuring services as well as goods at a lower value. When conducting procurement, public officers should follow the SPRs and relevant circulars strictly. Controlling Officers of the departments also have the responsibility to remind officers under their purview to comply with the relevant regulations and closely monitor their compliance.

  The prevailing procurement regime has put in place checks and balances with clear segregation of responsibilities and well-defined workflow to safeguard the procurement process. As far as the procurement of goods and services is concerned, departments formulate procurement requirements in accordance with their operational needs, and tender assessment panels (TAPs) evaluate tender submissions and recommend a tender for acceptance. TAPs' recommendation is subject to further evaluation by tender committees chaired by directorate officers of the departments. Depending on contract value, procurement exercises at a higher value may warrant scrutiny by the GLD Tender Board or the Central Tender Board to ensure compliance.

  In addition, we have put in place other measures to monitor departments' procurement work. Currently, departments should conduct biennial self-assessments to enhance staff awareness of compliance with procurement regulations and strengthen self-monitoring. As a third-party audit, GLD has also set up a dedicated team to conduct random on-site inspection of departments' procurement records from time to time. Over the past three years, GLD has inspected more than 100 procurement cases per year on average, and suggested improvement measures for specific cases.

  We acknowledge the importance of continuously enhancing the professional knowledge and execution abilities of procurement staff. Therefore, GLD regularly organises seminars and training courses. Over the past three years, GLD has organised more than 20 training activities in total, with over 1 600 attendances.

  We are also committed to fostering digitalisation. The Government's digitalised tendering system, commissioned starting from 2009, gradually enables suppliers to access tender notices, download tender documents, make tender submissions, and access notices of contract award, etc, online. We will continue to keep pace with the times and explore introducing technology in procurement work or monitoring procedures, thereby stepping up procurement efficiency.

  In terms of performance evaluation and contract management, departments take into account tenderers' track records in tender evaluation. As stipulated in the prevailing standard contract terms, the Government has the right to disqualify tenderers with previous significant or persistent contract defaults. After contract award, departments should evaluate contractors' performance regularly, and take actions in accordance with contract terms in case of unsatisfactory performance, such as issuance of warnings, suspension of payments, deduction from contract deposit, and even contract termination.

  The Government has been maintaining high transparency of procurement information. The public can access tender notices, contract award information, major procurement forecasts, and standard contract terms, etc, online.

  Having convened its first meeting in late August, the task force (Task Force on Review of Government Procurement Regime) will put forward enhancement proposals with a focus on aspects such as due diligence, tender requirements, contract management, and quality assurance.

(3) As regards the Hon Shang's question on public organisations, public organisations may devise their own procurement regimes based on their needs. The Hospital Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Authority have devised respective procurement regulations or guidelines for their staff to follow, and have organised regular training courses for them. The Government will share our best practices with public organisations from time to time, so as to ensure proper use of public resources.

  Thank you, President."
立法會三題：改善政府及公營機構的採購程序,2025-09-10 13:05,2025-09-10 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000368.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上尚海龍議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的答覆：

問題：

據報近日有政府部門被發現在執行採購程序上有嚴重疏漏和不足。有意見認為，事件反映政府未能在執行層面上嚴謹監督。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）如何加強監督政府部門的採購過程，以確保其嚴格遵守採購指引；會否引入更頻密的第三方審查或數字化監察系統，以即時識別及糾正採購程序中的異常情況；

（二）在檢討現行採購程序時，會否考慮在合約管理、供應商表現評核、價格與質量平衡機制等方面作出優化，引入更具彈性及競爭性的採購模式（例如電子投標或動態報價系統），並加強採購資料的透明度（例如定期向本會提交政府部門的採購合約摘要及供應商評分，讓本會能更有效地監察採購程序）；及

（三）會否為公營機構（例如醫院管理局及香港房屋委員會等）制訂更清晰的採購操作指引，並提供定期培訓及技術支援，以減少因執行細節失誤而導致的採購問題？

答覆：

主席：

政府各政策局和部門（下稱部門）採購的貨品和服務繁多，由通用和專業物品（如藥物和檢測儀器），以至服務合約（如管理安老院舍和清潔街道）。有見近日社會對政府個別採購項目的關注，尚海龍議員的提問正好讓我向大家闡述政府的採購制度：

（一）及（二）政府的採購政策是透過公平、公開及具競爭性的採購程序，取得物有所值的貨品和服務；同時透過《物料供應及採購規例》及相關通告，為採購工作訂立框架，並為採購流程提供詳細指引。

實際上，並非所有政府採購均由政府物流服務署（物流署）負責。一般而言，物流署會為部門供應所需的通用物品和採購價值超過一千萬元的貨品，而部門則自行負責採購服務和價值較低的貨品。政府人員在採購時，必須嚴格遵循《物料供應及採購規例》及相關通告。部門的管制人員亦有責任提醒轄下人員遵守相關規例，並監察循規情況。

在現行的採購制度下，各方的職責分工和工作流程均清晰明確，亦設有監察與制衡為採購過程把關。就採購貨品和服務而言，部門根據其運作需要訂定採購要求，投標書評審委員會在評審標書和推薦中標者後，將提交予由部門首長級人員領導的投標委員會進一步審核。視乎合約價值，較大額的採購則需交予物流署投標委員會或中央投標委員會審議，以確保採購合規。

此外，我們另有措施監察部門的採購工作。現時，部門須每兩年進行一次「自行評估」，以提高人員遵守採購規定的意識及加強自我監察。物流署亦設有專隊，不時到訪部門抽查採購紀錄，作第三方審查。過去三年，物流署每年平均查核超過100個採購項目，當中亦有就個別項目建議改善措施。

持續提升採購人員的專業知識與執行能力對完善採購工作至關重要，因此物流署定期舉辦研討會和培訓班。過去三年，物流署共舉辦超過20場培訓活動，參加人次超過1 600。

我們在數字化方面亦不遺餘力，政府的電子化投標系統於二○○九年啓用，逐步讓供應商可以上網查閱招標公告、下載招標文件、遞交標書、以及查閱已批出的合約公告等。我們會與時並進，積極研究在採購工作或監察流程引入科技，以進一步提升採購效率。

在表現評核及合約管理方面，部門在評審標書時會考慮投標者的往績。現時標準合約條款已訂明政府有權取消曾經嚴重或持續違約的投標者投標資格。批出合約後，部門須定期評估承辦商的表現，若表現欠佳，必須按合約條款採取行動，例如發出警告、停止付款、扣減按金，甚至終止合約等。

政府一直保持採購資訊的高透明度，公眾可在網上查閱政府招標公告、已批出的合約資料和主要採購預覽，以及標準合約條款等。

專責小組（檢討政府採購機制專責小組）已於八月下旬召開第一次會議，我們會聚焦在盡職調查、招標準則、合約管理和質量保證等方面提出優化建議。

（三）就尚議員有關公營機構的提問，公營機構可按其需要制訂自身的採購機制。醫院管理局和香港房屋委員會已分別制定採購規例或指引供其員工遵從，亦有定期為相關人員舉辦培訓課程。政府會不時與公營機構分享良好作業做法，以確保公共資源得到善用。

多謝主席。"
LCQ2: Combating illegal workers,2025-09-10 12:56,2025-09-10 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000361.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai and a reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (Sep 10):

Question:

 As reported, the problem of illegal workers has emerged in many industries in Hong Kong, including illegal employment involving visitors holding an ""endorsement for business visit"" in Hong Kong, and enterprises' solicitation of business by offering a low price through channels such as cross-border e-‍commerce platforms and their subsequent arrangement for the provision of services in Hong Kong by holders of an ""endorsement for individual visit"" that allows multiple entries. The situation concerned has affected the livelihood of local workers and caused unfair competition to local enterprises. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the monthly number of holders of an ""endorsement for individual visit"" with unusually frequent visits to Hong Kong (such as travelling to Hong Kong for four to five weekdays a week) since December last year; whether the authorities have taken the initiative to ascertain their purpose of visiting Hong Kong; of the number of visitors holding an ""endorsement for business visit"" who have been arrested for illegal employment in each month of the past two years, with a tabulated breakdown by type of employment;

(2) whether it will consider the introduction of new measures to combat illegal workers, such as implementing a reward system for reporting illegal workers, and enhancing publicity for the general public that if a service provider employs illegal workers, the customer may also have to bear criminal liability and offer compensation in case of accidents or incidents; and

(3) whether it will strengthen co-operation with the Mainland authorities in combating illegal workers, including eliminating information involving travelling to Hong Kong and providing services against the law from online platforms on the Mainland, removing non-compliant accounts, stepping up the penalty for offences involving illegal workers, and reminding Mainland residents of the criminal liability for engaging in illegal employment in Hong Kong, so as to prevent them from mistakenly believing in erroneous information?

Reply:

President,

 The Government is committed to combating illegal employment so as to protect job opportunities for the local workforce. It is a serious offence to engage in illegal employment. Illegal workers, employers, as well as aiders and abettors of illegal employment will be liable to prosecution in accordance with the Immigration Ordinance.

 According the record of the Immigration Department (ImmD), of the illegal workers arrested from 2023 up to August this year, around half of them were from Mainland, while the remaining included non-ethnic Chinese illegal immigrants or overstayers, and foreign domestic helpers, etc. During the said period, about two in a hundred thousand of all Mainland visitors entering Hong Kong with business visit endorsements were arrested for illegal employment while the relevant figure for Mainland visitors with multiple-entry individual visit endorsements was about one in a hundred thousand.

 In consultation with the ImmD, the Hong Kong Police Force (the Police) and the Labour Department (LD), the reply to the question raised by the Hon Shiu Ka-fai is as follows:

(1) Mainland travellers entering Hong Kong with business visit endorsements or multiple-entry individual visit endorsements are regarded as visitors in Hong Kong. In general, visitors shall not take up any employment, whether paid or unpaid, in Hong Kong.

 From 2023 to August this year, the monthly average number of persons entering Hong Kong with business visit endorsements who were arrested for illegal employment was 0.7. Since the resumption and expansion of multiple-entry individual visit endorsements for Shenzhen in December last year to August this year, the monthly average number of persons entering Hong Kong with such endorsements who were arrested for illegal employment was 4.1. These arrested persons were primarily engaged in work relating to the construction, catering and retail/wholesale sectors.

 The ImmD has all along been performing its gatekeeping role diligently. During immigration examination, the ImmD will conduct individual assessment on visitors with unusually frequent visits to Hong Kong in order to identify persons with doubtful purpose of visit. Depending on circumstances, the ImmD will refuse their entry or shorten their stay in Hong Kong. Where necessary, the ImmD will step up spot checks at control points targeting specific groups based on intelligence. The ImmD does not maintain other breakdown figures requested in the question.

(2) and (3) The Government has been adopting a multi-pronged strategy to combat illegal employment, including stepping up intelligence collection and strict law enforcement, increase in penalty, collaboration with Mainland authorities, as well as publicity and education.

(i) Stepping up intelligence collection and strict law enforcement

 Various law enforcement agencies have been proactively collecting intelligence and conducting joint operations to raid premises suspected of having illegal employment activities. Since the third quarter this year and up till now, the ImmD has carried out 3 500 enforcement actions for combating illegal employment, the monthly average increased by around 18 per cent over that of the second quarter. In August alone, the ImmD, in collaboration with relevant departments, mounted a series of territory-wide anti-illegal worker operations during which over 1 800 locations were inspected, and a total of 173 illegal workers and 67 employers were arrested. These operations were also widely publicised to achieve a deterrent effect.

 In addition, the ImmD conducts constant cyber patrols. It will take enforcement action by decoy operation against any person who is found using social media platforms, etc to arrange for illegal workers to work in Hong Kong. For example, the ImmD recently noticed through cyber patrols that some Mainland photographers and make-up artists were promoting on social media platforms that they could provide services in Hong Kong. After investigation, the ImmD conducted enforcement actions and arrested a total of 10 persons, including eight Mainland illegal workers.

 Meanwhile, during the enforcement actions against illegal hire car services taken by the Police since early this year, a total of eight illegal workers were arrested, and 11 persons alleged to have assisted illegal workers to engage in illegal employment in Hong Kong through online car hailing platforms were arrested for offences such as conspiracy to defraud.

 Besides, the labour inspectors of the LD will, under the power conferred by the Immigration Ordinance, continue to check the proof of identity of employees on site and records of employees kept by employers during regular workplace inspections. Suspected cases of illegal employment will be referred to law enforcement agencies for follow-up.

(ii) Increase in penalty

 The Government amended the Immigration Ordinance in 2021 by increasing the penalty on employing prohibited employees. The maximum penalty was significantly increased from the original fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and ten years' imprisonment. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence. The ImmD will pay close attention to sentences imposed by the courts, and where necessary, seek legal advice in considering whether to apply for a sentence review based on the case.

(iii) Collaboration with Mainland authorities

 The Police and the ImmD have established a reciprocal notification mechanism with the relevant Mainland authorities, and have always maintained liaison and intelligence exchange with them.

 Under the existing notification mechanism, the ImmD will regularly pass information on Mainland residents who have been convicted of criminal offences in Hong Kong, including those engaging in illegal employment, to relevant Mainland authorities. Depending on the circumstances, the Mainland authorities will not issue exit endorsements to such persons for a period of two to five years in general, in order to prevent them from revisiting Hong Kong for illegal activities. In addition, if anyone is found to have allegedly arranged for illegal workers to work in Hong Kong using Mainland online platforms, the ImmD will exchange intelligence with the Mainland authorities and urge them to arrange with the relevant platforms for taking appropriate follow-up actions, such as taking down the posts involved.

(iv) Publicity and education

 The Government has been actively conducting publicity and education through various channels, including press conferences, social media, promotional leaflets, etc, to enable the public to understand the criminal liability for employing illegal workers. Besides, in case of accidents involving any illegal workers, the validity of the relevant insurance policy may be affected. The ImmD also proactively reminds members of the public that customers may also be held criminally liable if they knowingly employ illegal workers via any service providers to offer services for them.

 Meanwhile, the ImmD actively disseminates information on the effectiveness of the latest enforcement operations against illegal employment and the message of ""Employing Illegal Workers is an Offence"" through its official accounts of social media platforms frequently used by Hong Kong and Mainland residents such as Xiaohongshu, Weibo and Instagram. This can facilitate easier access to the relevant information by local residents and Mainland visitors.

 Illegal employment is an issue of public concern. Members of the public have been actively making such reports to the authorities. Currently, the ImmD provides dedicated reporting hotline and online reporting platform. The ImmD will explore more channels (such as WeChat and ""iAM Smart"" application) so as to further enhance the reporting mechanism for illegal workers, and will review the effectiveness from time to time.

 The Government will continue to adopt a wider range of measures to step up efforts in combating illegal workers with a view to protecting the local workforce."
​立法會二題：打擊非法勞工,2025-09-10 12:56,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000360.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上邵家輝議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的答覆：

問題：

據報本港多個行業出現黑工問題，包括有持商務簽注旅客來港非法工作，以及有企業透過跨境電商平台等渠道低價招攬生意，然後安排持「一簽多行」個人遊簽注人士來港提供服務，有關情況影響本地工人生計，並對本港企業造成不公平競爭。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計自去年十二月以來，每月有多少名持個人遊簽注人士不尋常地頻繁訪港（例如在一周內有四至五個平日來港）；當局有否主動了解他們的訪港目的；過去兩年，每月有多少名持商務簽注旅客因非法工作被捕，並按工作種類以表列出分項數字；

（二）會否考慮推出打擊黑工新措施，例如實行舉報黑工獎賞制度，以及加強向公眾宣傳，若服務提供者僱用黑工，顧客亦有機會負上刑責及就意外事故賠償；及

（三）會否與內地當局加強合作打擊黑工，包括清除內地網上平台上涉及非法來港提供服務的資訊、刪除違規帳號、加重涉及黑工罪行的刑罰，以及提醒內地居民來港非法工作的刑責，以免其誤信錯誤資訊？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地勞工的就業機會。從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，非法勞工、僱主，以及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。

根據入境事務處（入境處）的紀錄，由二○二三年至今年八月被捕的非法勞工中，約一半來自內地，其餘包括非華裔非法入境者或逾期逗留者，及外籍家庭傭工等。期間，持商務簽注或「一簽多行」個人遊簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的內地人士，分別約佔持該類簽注訪港旅客總數的十萬分之二和十萬分之一。

就邵議員的提問，經諮詢入境處、警務處及勞工處，現回覆如下：

（一）以商務簽注或「一簽多行」個人遊簽注訪港的內地旅客，在香港的身分均為訪客。一般而言，訪客不得在香港從事有薪或無薪的工作。

二○二三年至今年八月，持商務簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的月均人數為0.7。自去年十二月恢復和擴展深圳「一簽多行」個人遊簽注後至今年八月，持「一簽多行」個人遊簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的月均人數為4.1。被捕人士主要從事與建造、餐飲和零售批發有關的工作。

入境處一直嚴格把關，在入境審查時會對不尋常地頻繁來港的訪客作個別評估，以識別其訪港目的是否有可疑，並因應情況拒絕他們入境或縮短其留港日數。如有需要，入境處會根據情報於管制站加強抽查個別目標群組。入境處沒有備存提問要求的其他分項數字。

（二）及（三）政府一直採取多管齊下的策略打擊非法勞工，包括加強情報收集和嚴格執法、加強罰則、加強與內地當局合作，以及加強宣傳教育。

（i）加強情報收集和嚴格執法

各執法部門一直主動搜集情報，對懷疑有非法工作的場所進行聯合行動。今年第三季至今，入境處打擊非法勞工的執法行動達3 500次，月均數字較第二季增加約百分之十八。單以八月計，入境處聯同其他相關部門在多區展開反黑工工作，巡查超過1 800個地點，共拘捕了173名非法勞工和67名僱主，並大力宣傳以收阻嚇之效。

另外，入境處亦持續進行網上巡邏。如發現有人利用社交平台等安排非法勞工來港工作，會以「放蛇」方式執法。例如，入境處近日透過網上巡邏留意到有內地攝影師及化妝師利用社交平台宣傳，聲稱可以在香港提供服務。入境處經調查及採取「放蛇」行動後，合共拘捕10人，包括八名內地非法勞工。

與此同時，自今年初警務處於針對「白牌車」的執法行動中，共拘捕了八名非法勞工，及以串謀詐騙等罪名拘捕了11名涉嫌協助非法勞工透過網約車平台非法在港工作的人士。

此外，勞工處的勞工督察亦會繼續於日常巡查工作場所執行勞工法例時，根據《入境條例》賦予的權力，查核在工作場所內工作人士的身分證明文件，以及僱主備存的僱傭紀錄。如發現懷疑非法工作的個案，會轉介執法機構跟進。

（ii）加強罰則

政府於二○二一年修訂《入境條例》，增加了對僱主僱用受禁僱員的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁十年。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。入境處會密切留意法庭的判刑，有需要時會因應個案諮詢法律意見，考慮是否就判刑提出覆核。

（iii）與內地當局合作

警務處和入境處與內地相關部門設有互通機制，並一直保持聯繫及情報交流。

按照現行的通報機制，入境處會定期向內地相關部門提供在香港因刑事罪行被定罪的內地人士資料，包括從事非法工作的內地人士。內地當局視乎情況，一般在兩至五年內都不會向相關人士簽發赴港簽注，防止他們再次來港從事違法活動。另外，入境處如發現有人利用內地網上平台涉嫌安排非法勞工來港工作，會與內地當局交換情報，並促請內地當局與相關平台作適當跟進，例如要求「下架」涉事帖文。

（iv）宣傳教育

政府一直積極透過不同的渠道進行宣傳教育，包括新聞發布會、社交媒體、宣傳單張等，讓市民明白僱用非法勞工的刑責。另外，當發生意外時，或會因涉及非法勞工而影響相關保險效力。入境處亦主動提醒市民作為顧客如明知而透過服務提供者僱用非法勞工為其提供服務，亦有可能要負上刑責。

同時，入境處積極透過香港及內地居民常用的社交媒體，例如小紅書、微博、Instagram等的官方帳號，發放最新反非法勞工行動的執法成效及「聘用非法員工即屬違法」的信息，以助本地市民及內地訪客更容易接收相關資訊。

非法勞工是大眾關注的議題，市民一直積極舉報。目前，入境處設有舉報專線及網上舉報平台。入境處將會開拓更多渠道，例如微信及「智方便」應用程式，以完善非法勞工舉報機制，並不時檢視成效。

政府會繼續採取更多不同措施加大力度打擊非法勞工，以保障本地勞工。"
立法會九題：酒店房租稅,2025-09-10 12:52,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000309.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上姚柏良議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

政府在本年一月一日起恢復徵收酒店房租稅，稅率為房租的百分之三。然而，有酒店和賓館業界人士認為，由於經營成本不斷上升及周邊市場競爭激烈，加上旅客對酒店價格的敏感度大幅提高，政府應持續關注和評估重徵酒店房租稅對業界的影響。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，本年一月至六月每月香港的酒店及賓館的以下資料：（i）酒店及賓館數目和（ii）其所提供的房間總數（按有否繳付酒店房租稅列出），以及（iii）政府所徵收的酒店房租稅金額（以表列出）；

（二）有否統計，第（一）項所述的不需繳付酒店房租稅的房間中，有多少間是屬於長期住房（按月以表列出）；

（三）有否檢視恢復徵收酒店房租稅後的徵收情況是否符合預期，以及如何評估恢復徵稅對香港酒店競爭力的影響；

（四）據悉當局表示酒店房租稅並不屬酒店房價的一部分，並曾促請網上旅遊平台（平台）不要以包含該稅項的房價為基礎計算向酒店及賓館收取的佣金，當局有否統計現時有多少間平台仍以含稅房價計算有關佣金；當局有何措施推動平台以不含稅房價為基礎計算佣金；

（五）會否考慮引入電子申報方式，以便利酒店及賓館申報酒店房租稅，從而減少業界的行政工作；

（六）有否計劃善用酒店房租稅稅收，推動酒店及賓館的升級轉型，以提升業界的競爭力；如有，計劃詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（七）鑑於有酒店業界人士認為，行業正面對激烈的競爭，建議政府調低或停徵酒店房租稅，政府會否考慮有關建議；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席︰

酒店房租稅是根據《酒店房租稅條例》（第348章）（《條例》）對酒店和賓館徵收的稅項。政府由二○二五年一月一日起恢復徵收酒店房租稅，稅率為百分之三，作為政府財政整合計劃的一部分。

＾不包括由相同住客在同一酒店或賓館住宿不少於連續28晚，被視作長期住房的房間。酒店或賓館無須就相關房租繳付酒店房租稅。由於酒店或賓館無須就其長期住房的資料向稅務局申報，因此稅務局沒有備存有關資料。

＃包括《條例》豁免繳納房租稅的酒店或賓館，即（a）房租的租金低於每日15元；（b）住房是由以非牟利性質成立和經營的社團所提供；或（c）酒店或賓館通常可供客人入住的房間不足10間。

根據《條例》，酒店房租稅按季徵收，酒店及賓館東主須在每季結束後的14天內向稅務局繳交須繳的稅項。政府就二○二五第一季和第二季所收取的酒店房租稅金額分別約為1.9億元和1.7億元。

（三）自公布恢復徵收酒店房租稅以來，政府一直與酒店及賓館業界代表保持緊密溝通，透過會面、簡介會及溝通平台，協助業界充分了解酒店房租稅的運作安排，並在制定執行細節時，吸納業界的意見。稅務局持續更新網上相關資料及常見問答、設立電話專線及在稅務中心設立服務台，為業界、市民及旅客提供資訊。稅務局亦不時派員到訪酒店及賓館，了解業界在填寫酒店房租稅申報表及繳稅時遇到的問題，以提供協助及解說。據我們了解，現時業界在填寫申報表及繳稅方面沒有重大困難，政府徵收酒店房租稅的工作亦大致暢順。

在稅收方面，二○二五年首兩季所徵收的酒店房租稅佔全年預算的9.7億元約百分之三十七。根據過往資料，酒店下半年的入住率一般比上半年高，而酒店房租稅亦會隨房租的調整而改變，因此本財政年度酒店房租稅的最終收入將視乎全年過夜旅客人數及房租而定。

政府在研究恢復徵收酒店房租稅時，已充分考慮稅項對旅客及業界的影響。酒店房租稅佔酒店／賓館房租僅百分之三，並以從價方式徵收。由於有關稅項只佔過夜旅客在港消費的一小部分，我們認為不會影響旅客來港意欲。根據香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）的統計數字，二○二五年上半年的平均酒店入住率及過夜旅客人次比二○二四年同期分別上升約百分之二及百分之七。事實上，旅客選擇旅遊目的地時會考慮多方面因素，包括有關地方的吸引力。政府會繼續豐富香港的旅遊產品和體驗，開拓更多具特色的旅遊路線，舉辦不同類型的盛事活動，以及鼓勵酒店跟景點及活動主辦商聯乘提供住宿套票及優惠等，以吸引更多旅客來港並多留幾天。

（四）政府在恢復徵收酒店房租稅前，已經與網上旅遊平台（平台）界別會面，並向他們發電郵解釋酒店房租稅的運作安排，包括闡明如平台代收酒店房租稅，在計算向酒店及賓館收取的佣金時，不應將稅款計算在內。主流平台在與酒店及賓館處理佣金問題時均遵從政府建議。

（五）為了進一步提升工作效率和方便市民及業界繳稅，稅務局一直善用資訊科技以完善服務。稅務局正積極探討優化現時酒店房租稅的申報方式，包括使用電子報稅，以減少業界的行政工作。

（六）一如其他稅收，酒店房租稅會撥歸政府一般收入。政府會視乎不同政策範疇的實際需要，整體考慮如何將資源按審慎理財的原則作適當分配。

政府一直全力推動旅遊業和酒店／賓館業的整體發展。政府於二○二五至二六財政年度投入逾12.3億元重點發展旅遊業，落實「無處不旅遊」的理念和《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》，透過多項措施吸引旅客訪港，包括舉辦及支援盛事在港舉行、優化海濱設施、促進會展及獎勵旅遊、支持郵輪發展、並加強對中東及東盟旅客的推廣，同時推動智慧旅遊及優化平台以提升旅客體驗。政府會持續投入資源，透過旅發局加強宣傳，提升香港對旅客的吸引力。

（七）政府在制訂任何收入措施時，會考慮香港的經濟情況及發展需要、社會各界的意見，以及政府的財政情況。酒店房租稅能為政府提供穩定的收入來源，同時亦不會對普羅市民造成影響。政府現時暫無計劃調整酒店房租稅稅率。"
LCQ9: Hotel accommodation tax,2025-09-10 12:52,2025-09-10 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000314.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Yiu Pak-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Government has resumed the collection of hotel accommodation tax (HAT) at a rate of 3 per cent on the accommodation charges with effect from January 1 this year. However, some members of the hotel and guesthouse industry are of the view that, given the rising operating costs, fierce competitions from the nearby markets and the significantly heightened sensitivity to hotel accommodation charges among visitors, the Government should continue to pay attention to and assess the impact of reinstating HAT on the industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information regarding hotels and guesthouses in Hong Kong in each month from January to June this year: (i) the number of hotels and guesthouses and (ii) the total number of rooms provided (broken down by whether or not HAT has been charged), as well as (iii) the amount of HAT collected by the Government (set out in a table);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of rooms which are considered as long-term accommodations among those set out in (1) ‍on which HAT is not charged (set out in a table on a monthly basis);

(3) whether it has reviewed if the collection of HAT after its reinstatement meets expectations, and how it assesses the impact of reinstating HAT on the competitiveness of hotels in Hong Kong;

(4) as it is learnt that the authorities have indicated that HAT is not part of the hotel room tariffs, and they have urged online travel platforms (OTP(s)) not to calculate the commissions payable by hotels and guesthouses based on the room rates with HAT, whether the authorities have compiled statistics on the number of OTPs which are still calculating the commissions concerned based on the tax-loaded room rates at present; of the measures put in place by the authorities to promote OTPs to calculate commissions based on the room rates without HAT;

(5) whether it will consider introducing electronic filing of documents to facilitate hotels and guesthouses in making returns in respect of their payable HAT, thereby reducing the administrative workload of the industry;

(6) whether it has plans to make good use of the HAT revenue to promote the upgrading and transformation of hotels and guesthouses to enhance competitiveness of the industry; if so, of the details of the plans; if not, the reasons for that; and

(7) since some members of the hotel industry are of the view that they are facing intense competition and have proposed reduction or suspension of the collection of HAT by the Government, will the Government consider such proposals; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The hotel accommodation tax (HAT) is imposed on hotels and guesthouses under the Hotel Accommodation Tax Ordinance (Cap. 348) (the Ordinance). The Government resumed the collection of HAT at a rate of 3 per cent with effect from January 1, 2025, as part of its comprehensive fiscal consolidation programme.

  Upon consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), my reply to Hon Yiu Pak-leung's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) The number of hotels and guesthouses in Hong Kong and the total number of rooms provided by them from January to June 2025 are as follows:

^ Excluding rooms occupied by the same guest(s) in the same hotel/guesthouse for not less than 28 consecutive nights, which are regarded as long-term accommodation. Hotels or guesthouses are not required to pay HAT for the relevant accommodation charges. Since hotels or guesthouses are not required to report information of long-term accommodation to the IRD, the IRD does not maintain relevant information.

# Including hotels or guesthouses exempted from paying HAT under the Ordinance, i.e. (a) the rate of the accommodation charge is less than $15 per day; (b) the accommodation is provided by society not established or conducted for profit; or (c) the hotel or guesthouse contains less than 10 rooms normally available for lodging guests.

  Under the Ordinance, HAT is levied quarterly and hotel and guesthouse proprietors should pay the tax to the Government within 14 days after quarter-end. The HAT collected by the Government for the first and second quarters of 2025 amounted to about $190 million and $170 million respectively.

(3) Since the announcement of resumption of collection of HAT, the Government has maintained close communication with the representatives of the hotel and guesthouse industry. We assisted the industry in understanding the operational arrangement of HAT through meetings, briefings and a communication platform, and incorporated the industry's feedback when formulating the implementation details. The IRD has updated the relevant information and frequently asked questions on their website from time to time, and set up a telephone enquiry hotline and a dedicated helpdesk at the Inland Revenue Centre to provide information to the industry, general public and visitors. The IRD also visits hotels and guesthouses from time to time to see if the industry has any problems in completing the returns and making tax payments, and to provide assistance and clarifications. We understand that the industry has no major difficulties in completing the returns and making tax payment. The Government's work on HAT collection has been generally smooth.

  In terms of tax revenue, the HAT collected for the first two quarters of 2025 accounts for around 37 per cent of the annual estimate of $970 million. According to past data, the hotel occupancy rates in the second half of the year are generally higher than those in the first half. Furthermore, the HAT that can be collected varies with adjustments in room rates. Hence, the final revenue from HAT for this financial year will depend on the total number of overnight visitors and room rates throughout the year.

  The Government fully took into account the impact of the tax on visitors and the industry when considering the resumption of collection of HAT. HAT only constitutes 3 per cent of hotel/guesthouse room rates and is levied on an ad valorem basis. Since the relevant tax only accounts for a small portion of the total spending of overnight visitors in Hong Kong, we do not consider that it will affect visitors' wish to consider Hong Kong as a travel destination. According to the statistics of the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), the average hotel occupancy rate and the number of overnight visitors for the first half of 2025 increased by around 2 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, compared to the same period in 2024. In fact, visitors take into account multiple factors when selecting travel destinations, including the appeal of the relevant places. The Government will continue to enrich Hong Kong's tourism products and experiences, develop distinctive travel itineraries, host different types of mega events and encourage hotels to collaborate with attractions and event organisers to provide accommodation packages and special offers, with a view to attracting more visitors to Hong Kong and extend their stays.

(4) Prior to the resumption of collection of HAT, the Government met with representatives from online travel agencies (OTAs) and issued emails to them to explain the operational arrangement of HAT. We clarified that, if OTAs collect HAT on behalf of the hotels or guesthouses, the tax amount should not be included in the calculation of commissions charged to hotels and guesthouses. Mainstream OTAs have followed the Government's appeal when handling the commissions with hotels and guesthouses.

(5) To further enhance operational efficiency and facilitate tax payments by the public and industries, the IRD has been making good use of information technology to improve their services. The IRD is actively exploring ways to improve the current filing process of HAT, including electronic filing, to reduce the administrative work of the industry.

(6) Similar to other taxes, HAT forms part of the Government's general revenue. The Government will consider the actual needs of different policy areas and holistically consider how to allocate resources in accordance with the principle of prudent financial management.

  The Government is fully committed to promoting the overall development of the tourism industry and hotel/guesthouse industry. In a bid to pursue the concept of ""tourism is everywhere"" and implement the Development Blueprint for Hong Kong's Tourism Industry 2.0, the Government has allocated over $1.23 billion in 2025-26 financial year to prioritise tourism development. An array of measures will be implemented to attract visitors, which include hosting and supporting mega events in Hong Kong, enhancing harbourfront facilities, facilitating meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions tourism, supporting cruise development, stepping up publicity targeting Middle Eastern and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) visitors, as well as promoting smart tourism and refining the platform to enhance visitors' experiences. The Government will continue allocating resources to strengthen its promotional efforts through the HKTB, thereby boosting Hong Kong's appeal to visitors.

(7) In formulating any revenue measures, the Government will take into account the economic situation and development needs of Hong Kong, views from different sectors of the community and the Government's fiscal situation. The HAT provides a stable source of Government revenue without affecting members of the public. The Government currently has no plan to adjust the HAT rate."
立法會二十題：交椅洲人工島填海工程項目,2025-09-10 12:50,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000384.htm,"​以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上盧偉國議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

特區政府早前表示，政府會先集中精力，全力加速推進北部都會區建設，而推展交椅洲人工島填海工程項目（交椅洲項目）的速度則可作放緩，但當局仍會切實做好研究階段的各項必要準備工作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府就二○二五至二○二六財政年度開支預算回覆本會議員問題時表示，土木工程拓展署正檢視及調整交椅洲項目環境影響評估報告中的相關背景資料及項目描述，並會適時展示該報告供公眾查閱，相關工作的最新進展為何；

（二）政府目前就交椅洲項目正進行哪些研究工作，以確保日後在適當時機可以迅速啟動該項目的建造工程；及

（三）目前有否就交椅洲項目制訂發展時間表；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

造地需時，涉及各方面的規劃和研究，以及進行不同的土地和基建工程。政府有責任未雨綢繆，以長遠目光主導土地發展，確保有充足的土地可適時供應，以支持香港的長遠經濟發展和民生所需。政府亦深知，土地供應必須循序漸進，務實推進，並參考包括市場經濟狀況等一籃子因素。經深思熟慮相關因素後，政府在今年初公開表示，目前會聚焦發展北部都會區，而交椅洲人工島（交椅洲）項目作為另一個大型土地發展計劃的優次則較低，但政府會繼續進行交椅洲項目已開展的研究。

就盧偉國議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）交椅洲項目現時處於前期規劃和研究階段，土木工程拓展署（土拓署）於去年十二月三十一日向環境保護署（環保署）提交項目當中有關填海工程的環境影響評估報告（環評報告）。雖然環保署隨後通知土拓署該環評報告適合供公眾人士查閱，但基於交椅洲項目的推展時間會放緩並且還未有具體安排，發展局經檢視情況後認為現階段不宜繼續推進有關的法定環評程序（包括公眾查閱、向環境諮詢委員會提交環評報告及環保署署長考慮批准環評報告），這是考慮到在未有目標填海時間表的情況下進行該程序，可能令討論難以聚焦，亦可能引起公眾擔心審批結果經過一段時間後是否仍然適用。為免引起公眾對交椅洲項目不必要的揣測及爭論，我們認為適宜待填海工程的推展時間表大致確定並按當時需要更新該環評報告後，才向環保署提交並按程序適時展示供公眾查閱及尋求審批，是較為穩妥的安排。

（二）交椅洲項目是長遠土地供應的來源，因此雖然項目未有明確的推展時間表，但現時進行的研究所得的分析和資料對日後繼續推進項目尤為重要，仍然適用和極具參考價值，有助在條件許可時提速啓動交椅洲項目。現時，政府會繼續完成已開展的研究，包括土地勘探、填海及主要交通基建的初步設計、土地發展相關的技術評估等的工作。縱使完成這些研究後，仍須進行其他研究，尤其是詳細的工程設計，方可有條件進入填海階段。然而，已開展的研究可為我們在適當時候啟動其他必要的準備工作奠定良好基礎。

（三）基於上文所述情況，政府目前沒有為交椅洲項目制定推展時間表，實際上填海工程亦未有條件於本屆政府任期內開展。"
立法會十一題：處理廢汽車輪胎,2025-09-10 12:30,2025-09-10 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000308.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上林素蔚議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為本港大量廢汽車輪胎被棄置在堆填區內是浪費資源，而將該等輪胎轉化為橡膠粉，並添加到傳統瀝青作鋪路物料（橡膠瀝青），既能處理廢輪胎和提升環保效益，亦可降低工務工程成本。此外，時任運輸及物流局局長在去年八月十七日的網誌中表示，路政署就應用橡膠瀝青鋪路的研究取得理想結果，並正研究更廣泛地應用該物料於道路維修工程。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）去年至今棄置於堆填區的廢汽車輪胎數量為何；

（二）過去三年，每年全港道路工程的瀝青物料的總耗用量，以及回收再造以作橡膠瀝青用途的廢輪胎數量為何；當局有否計劃全面採用橡膠瀝青鋪路，以及有否評估應用該物料鋪路的潛在減廢效益（包括全面採用該物料鋪路後每年可增加處理的廢輪胎數量）為何；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於根據路政署網頁資料，政府於今年四月起全面使用一種名為「高改性瀝青瑪蹄脂碎石混合料」的低噪音鋪路物料作鋪路用途，但該署亦表示現正實地測試橡膠瀝青以為日後應用該物料鋪路訂立準則，當局在決定選用何種鋪路物料時的主要考慮因素為何（例如是否包括技術和成本上的差異）？

答覆：

主席：

就林素蔚議員提問的各部分，經諮詢環境及生態局、環境保護署及路政署後，現回覆如下：

（一）二○二一年至二○二三年棄置於堆填區的車輛輪胎廢物總量表列如下：




年份
			（註一）
棄置於堆填區的車輛輪胎廢物總量
			（公噸）（註二）

2023
14300



註一︰二○二四年的相關統計數字仍在編製中
註二︰包括少量不能分類的其他輪胎

（二）及（三）橡膠瀝青是一種以廢舊輪胎製成的橡膠顆粒替代部分石油瀝青的鋪路物料。早前，路政署與學界共同研究及確立了將廢棄車胎橡膠粉加入傳統瀝青物料中的技術可行性。這項技術不僅為廢棄輪胎提供了回收再造的途徑，減少堆填區負擔，同時也可減少耗用不可再生的石油資源。在上述研究的實地試驗結束後，路政署已於二○二四年將橡膠瀝青鋪路物料納入道路維修合約內，作為道路維修時可選用的物料之一，並會因應路段實際需要和成本效益配合使用。

除使用傳統瀝青和橡膠瀝青作鋪路物料外，路政署亦持續研發及引入更耐用的瀝青物料，並自二○二五年四月一日起全面應用高改性瀝青物料於合適路段作鋪路之用，以進一步提升本港整體路面質素。

路政署在決定選用何種鋪路物料時，會根據相關道路的需要及鋪路物料的成本效益等因素，從傳統瀝青物料、橡膠瀝青物料，以及高改性瀝青物料當中，選用合適的鋪路物料。一般而言，傳統瀝青和橡膠瀝青應用於非繁忙的市區及郊區道路，而高改性瀝青物料會用於交通流量高的行車路段中。舉例來說，在高改性瀝青物料中，能有效減少輪胎路面噪音的「6毫米高改性瀝青瑪蹄脂碎石混合料」特別適用於鄰近民居的市區道路路面，而透水性高的「高改性瀝青多孔摩擦層」則多適用高速公路路面。

另一方面，鋪路物料的成本效益亦是選用何種鋪路物料時的重要準則。就傳統瀝青物料及橡膠瀝青物料而言，按路政署估算，由於以橡膠瀝青物料鋪路的整體工程成本（包括建造及維修保養）比以傳統瀝青物料鋪路顯著地高，而其耐用性亦不及高改性瀝青物料。因此，考慮到其成本效益，路政署現時會在部分非繁忙的市區及郊區道路的工程中使用橡膠瀝青物料鋪路。另外，就高改性瀝青物料而言，根據路政署估算，雖然使用高改性瀝青物料的整體工程成本略高於傳統瀝青物料，高改性瀝青物料具有更優異的耐用性，能夠減低路面維修的頻率及重鋪路面工程對公眾造成的不便，從而減少社會成本。隨着路政署全面應用高改性瀝青物料於合適路段作鋪路之用，其成本亦預計將逐步下降。

過去三年，在全港工務部門所進行的道路工程下，每年耗用的瀝青物料總量平均約為33萬公噸，其中橡膠瀝青物料總量平均約為5 000公噸，當中包含約25公噸廢汽車輪胎橡膠粉。

路政署會繼續密切留意關於路面物料的最新研究、開發及實踐經驗，並適時檢視不同瀝青物料的應用計劃（包括橡膠瀝青物料），以在提升路面質素的同時，為社會帶來更大的效益。"
LCQ11: Handling of waste vehicle tyres,2025-09-10 12:30,2025-09-10 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000323.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lam So-wai and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

There are views that the disposal of large quantities of waste vehicle tyres at landfills in Hong Kong constitutes a waste of resources. Converting such tyres into rubber powder and adding it to conventional bitumin as a road paving material (rubberised bitumin) can facilitate the handling of waste tyres, enhance environmental benefits and also reduce costs of public works projects. In addition, in a blog post on August 17 last year, the then Secretary for Transport and Logistics, indicated that the Highways Department (HyD) had achieved satisfactory results in its research on the application of rubberised bitumin in road paving and was exploring the wider use of this material in road maintenance works. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of waste vehicle tyres disposed of at landfills since last year;

(2) of the total consumption of bituminous materials in road works across the territory and the quantity of waste tyres recycled for use in rubberised bitumin in each of the past three years; whether the authorities have plans to fully adopt rubberised bitumin for road paving, and whether an assessment has been conducted on the potential waste reduction benefits of using this material for road paving (including the additional quantity of waste tyres that could be handled annually after its full adoption); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) given that according to the information on the HyD's webpage, the Government has fully adopted a low noise road paving material called ""Highly Modified Stone Mastic Asphalt"" for road paving since April this year. However, the HyD has also stated that it has been conducting site trials on rubberised bitumin to formulate criteria for future application of this material in road paving, of the authorities' major considerations when deciding on the choice of road paving materials (e.g. whether technical and cost differences are included)?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Environmental Protection Department and the Highways Department (HyD), the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Lam So-wai is as follows:

(1) The total volume of vehicle tyre waste disposed of at landfills from 2021 to 2023 is tabulated as follows:




Year
			(Note 1)
Volume of vehicle tyre waste disposed of at landfills (tonnes) (Note 2)


2021
19900


2022
16200


2023
14300



Note 1: Relevant statistics for 2024 are still under compilation
Note 2: The volume includes a small volume of other tyres which cannot be classified

(2) and (3) Rubberised bituminous material is a paving material that replaces part of petroleum-based bitumen with crumb rubber made from waste tyres. The HyD, in collaboration with academia, has earlier researched and confirmed the technical feasibility of incorporating crumb rubber from waste tyres into conventional bituminous materials. Not only does this technology provide a recycling pathway for waste tyres and reduce burden on landfills, but it also lowers the consumption of non-renewable petroleum resources. Following the completion of site trials for the aforementioned research, the HyD incorporated rubberised bituminous paving materials into road maintenance contracts in 2024 as one of the optional materials for road repairs. Its application will be determined based on the actual needs of road sections and cost-effectiveness considerations.

In addition to using conventional and rubberised bituminous materials as paving materials, the HyD continues to research, develop and introduce more durable bituminous materials. Starting April 1, 2025, highly modified bituminous materials have been fully adopted for paving on suitable road sections to further enhance the overall quality of road pavement in Hong Kong.

When determining which paving material to use, the HyD selects the appropriate material from among conventional, rubberised, and highly modified bituminous paving materials taking into account factors such as the specific needs of the road and the cost-effectiveness of the paving materials. In general, conventional and rubberised bituminous materials are used on non-busy urban and rural roads, while highly modified bituminous materials are applied to high-traffic road sections. For example, among highly modified bituminous materials, the ""6 mm Highly Modified Stone Mastic Asphalt"", which effectively reduces tyre-road noise, is particularly suitable for urban road surfaces near residential areas, while the highly permeable ""Highly Modified Friction Course"" is more commonly used for highway surfaces.

On the other hand, the cost-effectiveness of paving materials is also an important criterion in selecting which paving material to use. Regarding conventional and rubberised bituminous materials, according to HyD's estimates, the overall project cost (including that of construction and maintenance) of paving with rubberised bituminous material is significantly higher than that of conventional bituminous material and its durability is lower than that of highly modified bituminous materials. Therefore, considering its cost-effectiveness, the HyD currently uses rubberised bituminous material for paving in certain non-busy urban and rural road projects. Moreover, regarding highly modified bituminous materials, according to HyD's estimates, although the overall cost is slightly higher than that of conventional bituminous materials, their better durability reduces the frequency of road maintenance and minimises the inconvenience caused by road resurfacing works to the public, thereby lowering social costs. With the full adoption of highly modified bituminous materials for suitable road sections, their costs are expected to gradually decrease.

Over the past three years, the total annual consumption of bituminous materials in road projects undertaken by public works departments in Hong Kong averaged approximately 330 000 tonnes, of which the total amount of rubberised bituminous material accounted for an average of about 5 000 tonnes. This included about 25 tonnes of crumb rubber recycled from waste tyres.

The HyD will continue to keep abreast of the latest research, development, and practical experience related to road paving materials and review the application plans for different bituminous materials (including rubberised bituminous materials) in a timely manner to enhance road pavement quality while bringing greater benefits to society."
