CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2026-01-18 20:35,2026-01-18 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/18/P2026011800752.htm,"​The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 18) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP again reminded parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly. The SIV remains one of the most effective methods of preventing influenza and its complications, and can reduce the risk of serious complications or death from infection.

The case involves a 14-year-old boy with underlying illness. He developed a fever, shortness of breath and productive cough since January 16. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on January 17 and was transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit for further management on the same day. He is currently in critical condition. His respiratory specimen tested positive for influenza A virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia and septic shock.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the boy received the 2025/26 SIV only three days before onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, the boy was not protected by the vaccine. Therefore, it is not counted as being vaccinated. The boy had no travel history during the incubation period. Two of his household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms earlier. The nasal swab sample of one of the household contacts tested positive for influenza A virus via rapid antigen test. The symptoms were mild and hospitalisation was not required.

The summer influenza season just ended had recorded 25 severe paediatric influenza cases, including three fatal cases. The affected children were aged between 6 months to 17 years old. Among them, 20 cases (80 per cent) had not received an SIV (including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only four days before onset of illness).

""The summer influenza season was ended. However, influenza activity may rise again as the weather remains cold in the first quarter of this year and it cannot be ruled out that the circulating virus strains may change as the winter influenza season approaches. Therefore, I once again urge all individuals aged 6 months or older, except those with known contraindications, to act promptly if they have not yet received an SIV. This includes those who contracted influenza during the summer influenza season in order to guard against other circulating virus strains that may emerge during the upcoming winter influenza season. Furthermore, although there are some antigenic differences between the currently circulating influenza A (H3) virus strain and the virus strain contained in the vaccine, scientific research indicates that this season's influenza vaccines can still offer protection against the variant strain of subclade K, as well as the influenza A (H1) and influenza B strains included in the vaccine,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

""Although the influenza activity has declined to below the baseline level at the moment, outbreaks caused by influenza viruses still occurred in schools and residential care homes. For children who did not join the SIV School Outreach Programme, parents should promptly bring their children toprivate doctorsenrolled in the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme to receive an SIV. In addition, the SIV coverage rate for children aged 6 months to under 2 years is only about 23 per cent. Although this represents an approximate 4 percentage point increase compared to the same period last year, it is still much lower than that of other age groups. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to allow their children to receive an SIV,"" Dr Tsui added.

He also reminded members of the public that, especially for children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, they should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.

Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP'sseasonal influenzaandCOVID-19 & Flu Expresswebpages."
​再錄得一宗兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2026-01-18 18:55,2026-01-18 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/18/P2026011800682.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月十八日）接獲一宗兒童感染季節性流感的嚴重個案，再次提醒家長應盡快安排子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗。接種流感疫苗仍然是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的14歲男童。他於一月十六日出現發燒、氣促和咳嗽帶痰，一月十七日到東區尤德夫人那打素醫院急症室求醫，同日轉到該院兒童深切治療部接受進一步治療，目前情況危殆。他的呼吸道樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎和敗血性休克。

初步調查顯示，該男童於發病前三天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗，由於接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，所以男童未能受到疫苗保護，因此個案被視為未接種疫苗。男童在潛伏期內沒有外遊。他其中兩名家居接觸者早前均出現輕微呼吸道感染症狀，當中一名家居接觸者的鼻腔拭子樣本經快速測試後對甲型流感呈陽性反應，但症狀輕微，無需住院。

在剛結束的夏季流感季節，共錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。當中，20宗（80%）個案沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前四天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗）。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「雖然夏季流感季節已經完結，但隨着天氣在今年首季維持寒冷，而流行病毒株亦不排除會發生改變，流感活躍程度可能會再度上升，冬季流感季節即將到臨。因此，我再次呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗，應從速行動，包括在夏季流感季節曾感染流感的人士，以預防未來的冬季流感季節可能出現其他流行病毒株。此外，雖然目前流行的甲型（H3）流感病毒與疫苗所含的病毒株存在一些抗原差異，但科學研究顯示本季使用的季節性流感疫苗仍能對亞分支K的變異病毒株，以及疫苗中包含的甲型（H1）及乙型流感病毒提供保護。」

徐樂堅醫生補充：「雖然目前流感活躍程度目前已回落至低於基線水平，但學校及院舍的流感爆發仍然出現。如果學童沒有參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，家長應盡快帶子女到參加疫苗資助計劃的私家醫生接種季節性流感疫苗。此外，六個月至未滿兩歲的幼兒的季節性流感疫苗接種率只有約23%，雖然較上一季度同期上升約四個百分點，但仍遠低於其他年齡組別的接種率。中心已經透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵家長讓子女接種季節性流感疫苗。」

他亦提醒市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。

此外，高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

有關最新的資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞、流感網頁、新冠疫苗接種計劃網頁和疫苗接種計劃專頁。"
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-01-18 17:30,2026-01-18 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/18/P2026011800560.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（一月十八日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
———————

本港去年累計錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球已進入冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門會繼續在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續在青衣自然徑一帶進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。
​
市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-18 17:30,2026-01-18 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/18/P2026011800562.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 18), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

Cardinal Stephen Chow (Bishop of Hong Kong), Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle (Pro-Prefect of the Section for First Evangelization and New Particular Churches of the Dicastery for Evangelization),

Welcome, everyone, to Central, as we gather for the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong's ""Love–A Spring of Hope"" Music Prayer Service for the Blessing of Hong Kong. Through dance, drama and music, let us convey a message of hope, peace and unity to our society.

This year marks the 80th anniversary of the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong. Over the years, the Diocese has walked alongside Hong Kong society through every season, from post-war reconstruction to economic growth and transformation. It has remained a steady and positive presence in the community. Through their work in education, healthcare, and social services, the Church's sisters and brothers have put faith into positive action, bringing hope and comfort to countless individuals and families.

As the largest school sponsoring body in Hong Kong, the Catholic Diocese has nurtured generations of well-rounded individuals. Its hospitals and clinics provide professional and compassionate care to the sick, safeguarding our citizens' health.

  The Diocese also delivers a wide range of social services, caring for the vulnerable, supporting those in need, looking after the elderly and strengthening families. In doing so, it transcends boundaries of faith, ethnicity and social background, embodying the principle of ""love your neighbour as yourself"", reflecting the inclusive and compassionate spirit of Hong Kong.

Hong Kong is at a critical juncture of advancing from stability to prosperity, with vibrant economic development and cohesion. It's essential that we unite across the community to seize opportunities and thrive together. I'm confident that the Diocese will continue to create positivity for the community, working hand in hand with the Government and the people of Hong Kong to foster a harmonious society – together.

In closing, I wish the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong continued success as it builds on its legacy, serving society with compassion and spreading hope through faith. May today's service inspire us to join in ""Blessing Hong Kong"", praying for our beloved home to grow ever warmer, more united, more harmonious, more prosperous, and more secure. Thank you.

政務司司長出席香港青少年軍檢閱儀式致辭（只有中文）（附圖／短片）,2026-01-18 15:50,2026-01-18 18:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/18/P2026011800488.htm,"以下是政務司司長陳國基今日（一月十八日）出席香港青少年軍檢閱儀式的致辭：

尊敬的萬寧副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室青年工作部副部長）、張在歌大校（中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊副參謀長）、韓宇勝處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署處長）、陳振彬主席（香港青少年軍總會主席）、各位嘉賓、教官、家長、各位青年朋友：

大家好！我十分榮幸出席今天的香港青少年軍檢閱儀式，與各位一同慶祝香港青少年軍總會成立十周年，並見證各位成員的優秀表現。

剛才莊嚴的升旗儀式、整齊有力的步操，充分展現青少年軍成員的紀律與毅力，也讓我們看到總會十年來培訓工作的豐碩成果。

香港青少年軍總會作為香港首個正式採用中式隊列為核心基礎訓練的青少年制服團體，一直積極推廣中式步操，培養青少年的國家意識與團隊精神。在特區政府及社會各界的支持下，總會逐漸發展成為香港最具規模及影響力的青少年制服團體之一。

過去十年，總會秉承「從訓練中磨練意志」的宗旨，透過隊列步操、升旗、領導才能、野外求生等訓練課程，培養青少年自律、團結、堅毅的品格，並鼓勵他們積極參與社會服務，回饋社會，為建設香港、服務國家奠定基礎。

特區政府十分重視青年發展。我們致力培育愛國愛港、具備世界視野、有抱負和具正向思維的新一代。自《青年發展藍圖》（《藍圖》）公布以來，各政策局和部門均全力推進青年發展工作，落實《藍圖》中提出的超過160項具體行動和措施，並因應社會需要，陸續增加超過100項新舉措，全方位支持青年成長。

為推動青年全人發展，由我主持的青年發展委員會於二○二二年推出「青年歷奇訓練活動資助計劃」，鼓勵青年參與有系統、有質素的歷奇活動，建立正面價值觀，成為有擔當、有理想、願意貢獻香港和國家的未來棟樑。

第二輪資助計劃已經進一步優化，加入國家知識和香港歷史文化內容，讓青年認識國情、增強家國情懷。

香港青少年軍總會正正是獲資助的機構之一。總會積極響應特區政府的青年發展工作，並推出「青春挑戰‧築夢同行」計劃，透過一系列體驗活動，讓青少年在解決問題、克服挑戰中獲得成就感，培養他們的正向思維和韌性，合共讓超過3 000名青年受惠。

我期待總會繼續透過多元活動，激勵青年追尋夢想，促進團隊精神與成長；亦祝願香港青少年軍總會會務蒸蒸日上，各位身心康泰、事事順利。多謝大家！"

尊敬的萬寧副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室青年工作部副部長）、張在歌大校（中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊副參謀長）、韓宇勝處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區維護國家安全公署處長）、陳振彬主席（香港青少年軍總會主席）、各位嘉賓、教官、家長、各位青年朋友：

大家好！我十分榮幸出席今天的香港青少年軍檢閱儀式，與各位一同慶祝香港青少年軍總會成立十周年，並見證各位成員的優秀表現。

剛才莊嚴的升旗儀式、整齊有力的步操，充分展現青少年軍成員的紀律與毅力，也讓我們看到總會十年來培訓工作的豐碩成果。

香港青少年軍總會作為香港首個正式採用中式隊列為核心基礎訓練的青少年制服團體，一直積極推廣中式步操，培養青少年的國家意識與團隊精神。在特區政府及社會各界的支持下，總會逐漸發展成為香港最具規模及影響力的青少年制服團體之一。

過去十年，總會秉承「從訓練中磨練意志」的宗旨，透過隊列步操、升旗、領導才能、野外求生等訓練課程，培養青少年自律、團結、堅毅的品格，並鼓勵他們積極參與社會服務，回饋社會，為建設香港、服務國家奠定基礎。

特區政府十分重視青年發展。我們致力培育愛國愛港、具備世界視野、有抱負和具正向思維的新一代。自《青年發展藍圖》（《藍圖》）公布以來，各政策局和部門均全力推進青年發展工作，落實《藍圖》中提出的超過160項具體行動和措施，並因應社會需要，陸續增加超過100項新舉措，全方位支持青年成長。

尊敬的廖長江主席（香港賽馬會主席）、霍震霆會長（中國香港體育協會暨奧林匹克委員會會長）、鄧竟成主席（香港體育學院主席）、各位嘉賓、各位運動員、各位朋友：

大家好！今天我很高興來到沙田馬場，與大家一同出席十五運會香港獎牌運動員賽馬日，分享香港特區運動員在第十五屆全國運動會（全運會）上創下佳績的喜悅。

四年一度的全國運動會，是國家水平最高、規模最大的綜合運動會。今屆賽事由粵港澳三地共同承辦，更加是香港首次以承辦城市的身分，參與這項國家體育盛會，意義非凡。

這次十五運會得以「簡約、安全、精彩」地順利舉行，充分展現了粵港澳三地共融合作的強大力量，也為推動大灣區體育產業聯動發展，奠定了堅實的基礎。

香港特區派出歷來陣容最龐大的代表團參與今屆全運會，包括超過600名運動員及約270名隨隊工作人員和醫護人員，參與28個競賽項目，並在其中七個項目，取得九金、兩銀、八銅共19面獎牌，展現了運動員出色的競技水平和拼搏精神，更創下了香港特區參加全運會的最佳成績，令我們深感自豪。

香港賽馬會一直積極支持本地體育發展，更特別將今日的賽馬日命名為「十五運會香港獎牌運動員賽馬日」，表揚運動員為港爭光的傑出貢獻。

馬會是十五運會，以及全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會（殘特奧會）香港賽區的唯一「合作夥伴」，除了慷慨贊助四億五千萬元，支持香港賽區籌辦賽事，更派出約100名義工參與，協助賽事順利進行，貢獻良多。

馬會亦透過「賽馬會優秀運動員獎勵計劃」，獎勵在大型運動會取得佳績的香港運動員；而在這次十五運會中，獲獎牌的香港運動員合共獲頒發超過1,100萬元獎金。

香港運動員近年在國際賽事屢創佳績，實在有賴各位運動員、教練團隊和體育界的共同努力。特區政府亦繼續加大資源投放，完善體育發展的政策。

單單是二○二五至二六年度，政府透過「精英運動員發展基金」向香港體育學院提供超過10億元資助，支持精英運動發展。另外，我們亦從「藝術及體育發展基金（體育部分）」撥出超過5,400萬元，支持香港特區代表團參加今屆全運會和殘特奧會。

十五運會雖然已經圓滿結束，但政府推動體育發展的腳步不會停下。我衷心希望社會各界與政府攜手繼續支持香港運動員，為他們創造更佳環境與更多機會。期待他們在未來的全國以至國際體育舞台上，繼續發光發亮，盡展所長。

最後，我再次衷心感謝馬會以及所有支持體育發展的朋友。祝願各位運動員繼續追求卓越、再創高峰。亦祝各位身體健康、事事順利。多謝大家！"
