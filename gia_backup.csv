​立法會二題：打擊非法勞工,2025-09-10 12:56,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000360.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上邵家輝議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的答覆：

問題：

據報本港多個行業出現黑工問題，包括有持商務簽注旅客來港非法工作，以及有企業透過跨境電商平台等渠道低價招攬生意，然後安排持「一簽多行」個人遊簽注人士來港提供服務，有關情況影響本地工人生計，並對本港企業造成不公平競爭。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計自去年十二月以來，每月有多少名持個人遊簽注人士不尋常地頻繁訪港（例如在一周內有四至五個平日來港）；當局有否主動了解他們的訪港目的；過去兩年，每月有多少名持商務簽注旅客因非法工作被捕，並按工作種類以表列出分項數字；

（二）會否考慮推出打擊黑工新措施，例如實行舉報黑工獎賞制度，以及加強向公眾宣傳，若服務提供者僱用黑工，顧客亦有機會負上刑責及就意外事故賠償；及

（三）會否與內地當局加強合作打擊黑工，包括清除內地網上平台上涉及非法來港提供服務的資訊、刪除違規帳號、加重涉及黑工罪行的刑罰，以及提醒內地居民來港非法工作的刑責，以免其誤信錯誤資訊？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直致力打擊非法勞工，從而保障本地勞工的就業機會。從事非法工作屬嚴重罪行，非法勞工、僱主，以及協助和教唆他人從事非法工作的人士均會根據《入境條例》被檢控。

根據入境事務處（入境處）的紀錄，由二○二三年至今年八月被捕的非法勞工中，約一半來自內地，其餘包括非華裔非法入境者或逾期逗留者，及外籍家庭傭工等。期間，持商務簽注或「一簽多行」個人遊簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的內地人士，分別約佔持該類簽注訪港旅客總數的十萬分之二和十萬分之一。

就邵議員的提問，經諮詢入境處、警務處及勞工處，現回覆如下：

（一）以商務簽注或「一簽多行」個人遊簽注訪港的內地旅客，在香港的身分均為訪客。一般而言，訪客不得在香港從事有薪或無薪的工作。

二○二三年至今年八月，持商務簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的月均人數為0.7。自去年十二月恢復和擴展深圳「一簽多行」個人遊簽注後至今年八月，持「一簽多行」個人遊簽注來港而因非法工作被捕的月均人數為4.1。被捕人士主要從事與建造、餐飲和零售批發有關的工作。

入境處一直嚴格把關，在入境審查時會對不尋常地頻繁來港的訪客作個別評估，以識別其訪港目的是否有可疑，並因應情況拒絕他們入境或縮短其留港日數。如有需要，入境處會根據情報於管制站加強抽查個別目標群組。入境處沒有備存提問要求的其他分項數字。

（二）及（三）政府一直採取多管齊下的策略打擊非法勞工，包括加強情報收集和嚴格執法、加強罰則、加強與內地當局合作，以及加強宣傳教育。

（i）加強情報收集和嚴格執法

各執法部門一直主動搜集情報，對懷疑有非法工作的場所進行聯合行動。今年第三季至今，入境處打擊非法勞工的執法行動達3 500次，月均數字較第二季增加約百分之十八。單以八月計，入境處聯同其他相關部門在多區展開反黑工工作，巡查超過1 800個地點，共拘捕了173名非法勞工和67名僱主，並大力宣傳以收阻嚇之效。

另外，入境處亦持續進行網上巡邏。如發現有人利用社交平台等安排非法勞工來港工作，會以「放蛇」方式執法。例如，入境處近日透過網上巡邏留意到有內地攝影師及化妝師利用社交平台宣傳，聲稱可以在香港提供服務。入境處經調查及採取「放蛇」行動後，合共拘捕10人，包括八名內地非法勞工。

與此同時，自今年初警務處於針對「白牌車」的執法行動中，共拘捕了八名非法勞工，及以串謀詐騙等罪名拘捕了11名涉嫌協助非法勞工透過網約車平台非法在港工作的人士。

此外，勞工處的勞工督察亦會繼續於日常巡查工作場所執行勞工法例時，根據《入境條例》賦予的權力，查核在工作場所內工作人士的身分證明文件，以及僱主備存的僱傭紀錄。如發現懷疑非法工作的個案，會轉介執法機構跟進。

（ii）加強罰則

政府於二○二一年修訂《入境條例》，增加了對僱主僱用受禁僱員的刑罰，最高刑罰由原來的罰款35萬元和監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款50萬元和監禁十年。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。入境處會密切留意法庭的判刑，有需要時會因應個案諮詢法律意見，考慮是否就判刑提出覆核。

（iii）與內地當局合作

警務處和入境處與內地相關部門設有互通機制，並一直保持聯繫及情報交流。

按照現行的通報機制，入境處會定期向內地相關部門提供在香港因刑事罪行被定罪的內地人士資料，包括從事非法工作的內地人士。內地當局視乎情況，一般在兩至五年內都不會向相關人士簽發赴港簽注，防止他們再次來港從事違法活動。另外，入境處如發現有人利用內地網上平台涉嫌安排非法勞工來港工作，會與內地當局交換情報，並促請內地當局與相關平台作適當跟進，例如要求「下架」涉事帖文。

（iv）宣傳教育

政府一直積極透過不同的渠道進行宣傳教育，包括新聞發布會、社交媒體、宣傳單張等，讓市民明白僱用非法勞工的刑責。另外，當發生意外時，或會因涉及非法勞工而影響相關保險效力。入境處亦主動提醒市民作為顧客如明知而透過服務提供者僱用非法勞工為其提供服務，亦有可能要負上刑責。

同時，入境處積極透過香港及內地居民常用的社交媒體，例如小紅書、微博、Instagram等的官方帳號，發放最新反非法勞工行動的執法成效及「聘用非法員工即屬違法」的信息，以助本地市民及內地訪客更容易接收相關資訊。

非法勞工是大眾關注的議題，市民一直積極舉報。目前，入境處設有舉報專線及網上舉報平台。入境處將會開拓更多渠道，例如微信及「智方便」應用程式，以完善非法勞工舉報機制，並不時檢視成效。

政府會繼續採取更多不同措施加大力度打擊非法勞工，以保障本地勞工。"
立法會九題：酒店房租稅,2025-09-10 12:52,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000309.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上姚柏良議員的提問和財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇的書面答覆：

問題：

政府在本年一月一日起恢復徵收酒店房租稅，稅率為房租的百分之三。然而，有酒店和賓館業界人士認為，由於經營成本不斷上升及周邊市場競爭激烈，加上旅客對酒店價格的敏感度大幅提高，政府應持續關注和評估重徵酒店房租稅對業界的影響。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）有否統計，本年一月至六月每月香港的酒店及賓館的以下資料：（i）酒店及賓館數目和（ii）其所提供的房間總數（按有否繳付酒店房租稅列出），以及（iii）政府所徵收的酒店房租稅金額（以表列出）；

（二）有否統計，第（一）項所述的不需繳付酒店房租稅的房間中，有多少間是屬於長期住房（按月以表列出）；

（三）有否檢視恢復徵收酒店房租稅後的徵收情況是否符合預期，以及如何評估恢復徵稅對香港酒店競爭力的影響；

（四）據悉當局表示酒店房租稅並不屬酒店房價的一部分，並曾促請網上旅遊平台（平台）不要以包含該稅項的房價為基礎計算向酒店及賓館收取的佣金，當局有否統計現時有多少間平台仍以含稅房價計算有關佣金；當局有何措施推動平台以不含稅房價為基礎計算佣金；

（五）會否考慮引入電子申報方式，以便利酒店及賓館申報酒店房租稅，從而減少業界的行政工作；

（六）有否計劃善用酒店房租稅稅收，推動酒店及賓館的升級轉型，以提升業界的競爭力；如有，計劃詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（七）鑑於有酒店業界人士認為，行業正面對激烈的競爭，建議政府調低或停徵酒店房租稅，政府會否考慮有關建議；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席︰

酒店房租稅是根據《酒店房租稅條例》（第348章）（《條例》）對酒店和賓館徵收的稅項。政府由二○二五年一月一日起恢復徵收酒店房租稅，稅率為百分之三，作為政府財政整合計劃的一部分。

＾不包括由相同住客在同一酒店或賓館住宿不少於連續28晚，被視作長期住房的房間。酒店或賓館無須就相關房租繳付酒店房租稅。由於酒店或賓館無須就其長期住房的資料向稅務局申報，因此稅務局沒有備存有關資料。

＃包括《條例》豁免繳納房租稅的酒店或賓館，即（a）房租的租金低於每日15元；（b）住房是由以非牟利性質成立和經營的社團所提供；或（c）酒店或賓館通常可供客人入住的房間不足10間。

根據《條例》，酒店房租稅按季徵收，酒店及賓館東主須在每季結束後的14天內向稅務局繳交須繳的稅項。政府就二○二五第一季和第二季所收取的酒店房租稅金額分別約為1.9億元和1.7億元。

（三）自公布恢復徵收酒店房租稅以來，政府一直與酒店及賓館業界代表保持緊密溝通，透過會面、簡介會及溝通平台，協助業界充分了解酒店房租稅的運作安排，並在制定執行細節時，吸納業界的意見。稅務局持續更新網上相關資料及常見問答、設立電話專線及在稅務中心設立服務台，為業界、市民及旅客提供資訊。稅務局亦不時派員到訪酒店及賓館，了解業界在填寫酒店房租稅申報表及繳稅時遇到的問題，以提供協助及解說。據我們了解，現時業界在填寫申報表及繳稅方面沒有重大困難，政府徵收酒店房租稅的工作亦大致暢順。

在稅收方面，二○二五年首兩季所徵收的酒店房租稅佔全年預算的9.7億元約百分之三十七。根據過往資料，酒店下半年的入住率一般比上半年高，而酒店房租稅亦會隨房租的調整而改變，因此本財政年度酒店房租稅的最終收入將視乎全年過夜旅客人數及房租而定。

政府在研究恢復徵收酒店房租稅時，已充分考慮稅項對旅客及業界的影響。酒店房租稅佔酒店／賓館房租僅百分之三，並以從價方式徵收。由於有關稅項只佔過夜旅客在港消費的一小部分，我們認為不會影響旅客來港意欲。根據香港旅遊發展局（旅發局）的統計數字，二○二五年上半年的平均酒店入住率及過夜旅客人次比二○二四年同期分別上升約百分之二及百分之七。事實上，旅客選擇旅遊目的地時會考慮多方面因素，包括有關地方的吸引力。政府會繼續豐富香港的旅遊產品和體驗，開拓更多具特色的旅遊路線，舉辦不同類型的盛事活動，以及鼓勵酒店跟景點及活動主辦商聯乘提供住宿套票及優惠等，以吸引更多旅客來港並多留幾天。

（四）政府在恢復徵收酒店房租稅前，已經與網上旅遊平台（平台）界別會面，並向他們發電郵解釋酒店房租稅的運作安排，包括闡明如平台代收酒店房租稅，在計算向酒店及賓館收取的佣金時，不應將稅款計算在內。主流平台在與酒店及賓館處理佣金問題時均遵從政府建議。

（五）為了進一步提升工作效率和方便市民及業界繳稅，稅務局一直善用資訊科技以完善服務。稅務局正積極探討優化現時酒店房租稅的申報方式，包括使用電子報稅，以減少業界的行政工作。

（六）一如其他稅收，酒店房租稅會撥歸政府一般收入。政府會視乎不同政策範疇的實際需要，整體考慮如何將資源按審慎理財的原則作適當分配。

政府一直全力推動旅遊業和酒店／賓館業的整體發展。政府於二○二五至二六財政年度投入逾12.3億元重點發展旅遊業，落實「無處不旅遊」的理念和《香港旅遊業發展藍圖2.0》，透過多項措施吸引旅客訪港，包括舉辦及支援盛事在港舉行、優化海濱設施、促進會展及獎勵旅遊、支持郵輪發展、並加強對中東及東盟旅客的推廣，同時推動智慧旅遊及優化平台以提升旅客體驗。政府會持續投入資源，透過旅發局加強宣傳，提升香港對旅客的吸引力。

（七）政府在制訂任何收入措施時，會考慮香港的經濟情況及發展需要、社會各界的意見，以及政府的財政情況。酒店房租稅能為政府提供穩定的收入來源，同時亦不會對普羅市民造成影響。政府現時暫無計劃調整酒店房租稅稅率。"
LCQ9: Hotel accommodation tax,2025-09-10 12:52,2025-09-10 13:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000314.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Yiu Pak-leung and a written reply by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Government has resumed the collection of hotel accommodation tax (HAT) at a rate of 3 per cent on the accommodation charges with effect from January 1 this year. However, some members of the hotel and guesthouse industry are of the view that, given the rising operating costs, fierce competitions from the nearby markets and the significantly heightened sensitivity to hotel accommodation charges among visitors, the Government should continue to pay attention to and assess the impact of reinstating HAT on the industry. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether it has compiled statistics on the following information regarding hotels and guesthouses in Hong Kong in each month from January to June this year: (i) the number of hotels and guesthouses and (ii) the total number of rooms provided (broken down by whether or not HAT has been charged), as well as (iii) the amount of HAT collected by the Government (set out in a table);

(2) whether it has compiled statistics on the number of rooms which are considered as long-term accommodations among those set out in (1) ‍on which HAT is not charged (set out in a table on a monthly basis);

(3) whether it has reviewed if the collection of HAT after its reinstatement meets expectations, and how it assesses the impact of reinstating HAT on the competitiveness of hotels in Hong Kong;

(4) as it is learnt that the authorities have indicated that HAT is not part of the hotel room tariffs, and they have urged online travel platforms (OTP(s)) not to calculate the commissions payable by hotels and guesthouses based on the room rates with HAT, whether the authorities have compiled statistics on the number of OTPs which are still calculating the commissions concerned based on the tax-loaded room rates at present; of the measures put in place by the authorities to promote OTPs to calculate commissions based on the room rates without HAT;

(5) whether it will consider introducing electronic filing of documents to facilitate hotels and guesthouses in making returns in respect of their payable HAT, thereby reducing the administrative workload of the industry;

(6) whether it has plans to make good use of the HAT revenue to promote the upgrading and transformation of hotels and guesthouses to enhance competitiveness of the industry; if so, of the details of the plans; if not, the reasons for that; and

(7) since some members of the hotel industry are of the view that they are facing intense competition and have proposed reduction or suspension of the collection of HAT by the Government, will the Government consider such proposals; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The hotel accommodation tax (HAT) is imposed on hotels and guesthouses under the Hotel Accommodation Tax Ordinance (Cap. 348) (the Ordinance). The Government resumed the collection of HAT at a rate of 3 per cent with effect from January 1, 2025, as part of its comprehensive fiscal consolidation programme.

  Upon consultation with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau and the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), my reply to Hon Yiu Pak-leung's question is as follows:

(1) and (2) The number of hotels and guesthouses in Hong Kong and the total number of rooms provided by them from January to June 2025 are as follows:

^ Excluding rooms occupied by the same guest(s) in the same hotel/guesthouse for not less than 28 consecutive nights, which are regarded as long-term accommodation. Hotels or guesthouses are not required to pay HAT for the relevant accommodation charges. Since hotels or guesthouses are not required to report information of long-term accommodation to the IRD, the IRD does not maintain relevant information.

# Including hotels or guesthouses exempted from paying HAT under the Ordinance, i.e. (a) the rate of the accommodation charge is less than $15 per day; (b) the accommodation is provided by society not established or conducted for profit; or (c) the hotel or guesthouse contains less than 10 rooms normally available for lodging guests.

  Under the Ordinance, HAT is levied quarterly and hotel and guesthouse proprietors should pay the tax to the Government within 14 days after quarter-end. The HAT collected by the Government for the first and second quarters of 2025 amounted to about $190 million and $170 million respectively.

(3) Since the announcement of resumption of collection of HAT, the Government has maintained close communication with the representatives of the hotel and guesthouse industry. We assisted the industry in understanding the operational arrangement of HAT through meetings, briefings and a communication platform, and incorporated the industry's feedback when formulating the implementation details. The IRD has updated the relevant information and frequently asked questions on their website from time to time, and set up a telephone enquiry hotline and a dedicated helpdesk at the Inland Revenue Centre to provide information to the industry, general public and visitors. The IRD also visits hotels and guesthouses from time to time to see if the industry has any problems in completing the returns and making tax payments, and to provide assistance and clarifications. We understand that the industry has no major difficulties in completing the returns and making tax payment. The Government's work on HAT collection has been generally smooth.

  In terms of tax revenue, the HAT collected for the first two quarters of 2025 accounts for around 37 per cent of the annual estimate of $970 million. According to past data, the hotel occupancy rates in the second half of the year are generally higher than those in the first half. Furthermore, the HAT that can be collected varies with adjustments in room rates. Hence, the final revenue from HAT for this financial year will depend on the total number of overnight visitors and room rates throughout the year.

  The Government fully took into account the impact of the tax on visitors and the industry when considering the resumption of collection of HAT. HAT only constitutes 3 per cent of hotel/guesthouse room rates and is levied on an ad valorem basis. Since the relevant tax only accounts for a small portion of the total spending of overnight visitors in Hong Kong, we do not consider that it will affect visitors' wish to consider Hong Kong as a travel destination. According to the statistics of the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), the average hotel occupancy rate and the number of overnight visitors for the first half of 2025 increased by around 2 per cent and 7 per cent respectively, compared to the same period in 2024. In fact, visitors take into account multiple factors when selecting travel destinations, including the appeal of the relevant places. The Government will continue to enrich Hong Kong's tourism products and experiences, develop distinctive travel itineraries, host different types of mega events and encourage hotels to collaborate with attractions and event organisers to provide accommodation packages and special offers, with a view to attracting more visitors to Hong Kong and extend their stays.

(4) Prior to the resumption of collection of HAT, the Government met with representatives from online travel agencies (OTAs) and issued emails to them to explain the operational arrangement of HAT. We clarified that, if OTAs collect HAT on behalf of the hotels or guesthouses, the tax amount should not be included in the calculation of commissions charged to hotels and guesthouses. Mainstream OTAs have followed the Government's appeal when handling the commissions with hotels and guesthouses.

(5) To further enhance operational efficiency and facilitate tax payments by the public and industries, the IRD has been making good use of information technology to improve their services. The IRD is actively exploring ways to improve the current filing process of HAT, including electronic filing, to reduce the administrative work of the industry.

(6) Similar to other taxes, HAT forms part of the Government's general revenue. The Government will consider the actual needs of different policy areas and holistically consider how to allocate resources in accordance with the principle of prudent financial management.

  The Government is fully committed to promoting the overall development of the tourism industry and hotel/guesthouse industry. In a bid to pursue the concept of ""tourism is everywhere"" and implement the Development Blueprint for Hong Kong's Tourism Industry 2.0, the Government has allocated over $1.23 billion in 2025-26 financial year to prioritise tourism development. An array of measures will be implemented to attract visitors, which include hosting and supporting mega events in Hong Kong, enhancing harbourfront facilities, facilitating meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions tourism, supporting cruise development, stepping up publicity targeting Middle Eastern and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) visitors, as well as promoting smart tourism and refining the platform to enhance visitors' experiences. The Government will continue allocating resources to strengthen its promotional efforts through the HKTB, thereby boosting Hong Kong's appeal to visitors.

(7) In formulating any revenue measures, the Government will take into account the economic situation and development needs of Hong Kong, views from different sectors of the community and the Government's fiscal situation. The HAT provides a stable source of Government revenue without affecting members of the public. The Government currently has no plan to adjust the HAT rate."
立法會二十題：交椅洲人工島填海工程項目,2025-09-10 12:50,2025-09-10 13:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000384.htm,"​以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上盧偉國議員的提問和發展局局長甯漢豪的書面答覆：

問題：

特區政府早前表示，政府會先集中精力，全力加速推進北部都會區建設，而推展交椅洲人工島填海工程項目（交椅洲項目）的速度則可作放緩，但當局仍會切實做好研究階段的各項必要準備工作。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府就二○二五至二○二六財政年度開支預算回覆本會議員問題時表示，土木工程拓展署正檢視及調整交椅洲項目環境影響評估報告中的相關背景資料及項目描述，並會適時展示該報告供公眾查閱，相關工作的最新進展為何；

（二）政府目前就交椅洲項目正進行哪些研究工作，以確保日後在適當時機可以迅速啟動該項目的建造工程；及

（三）目前有否就交椅洲項目制訂發展時間表；若有，詳情為何；若否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

造地需時，涉及各方面的規劃和研究，以及進行不同的土地和基建工程。政府有責任未雨綢繆，以長遠目光主導土地發展，確保有充足的土地可適時供應，以支持香港的長遠經濟發展和民生所需。政府亦深知，土地供應必須循序漸進，務實推進，並參考包括市場經濟狀況等一籃子因素。經深思熟慮相關因素後，政府在今年初公開表示，目前會聚焦發展北部都會區，而交椅洲人工島（交椅洲）項目作為另一個大型土地發展計劃的優次則較低，但政府會繼續進行交椅洲項目已開展的研究。

就盧偉國議員提問的各部分，現回覆如下：

（一）交椅洲項目現時處於前期規劃和研究階段，土木工程拓展署（土拓署）於去年十二月三十一日向環境保護署（環保署）提交項目當中有關填海工程的環境影響評估報告（環評報告）。雖然環保署隨後通知土拓署該環評報告適合供公眾人士查閱，但基於交椅洲項目的推展時間會放緩並且還未有具體安排，發展局經檢視情況後認為現階段不宜繼續推進有關的法定環評程序（包括公眾查閱、向環境諮詢委員會提交環評報告及環保署署長考慮批准環評報告），這是考慮到在未有目標填海時間表的情況下進行該程序，可能令討論難以聚焦，亦可能引起公眾擔心審批結果經過一段時間後是否仍然適用。為免引起公眾對交椅洲項目不必要的揣測及爭論，我們認為適宜待填海工程的推展時間表大致確定並按當時需要更新該環評報告後，才向環保署提交並按程序適時展示供公眾查閱及尋求審批，是較為穩妥的安排。

（二）交椅洲項目是長遠土地供應的來源，因此雖然項目未有明確的推展時間表，但現時進行的研究所得的分析和資料對日後繼續推進項目尤為重要，仍然適用和極具參考價值，有助在條件許可時提速啓動交椅洲項目。現時，政府會繼續完成已開展的研究，包括土地勘探、填海及主要交通基建的初步設計、土地發展相關的技術評估等的工作。縱使完成這些研究後，仍須進行其他研究，尤其是詳細的工程設計，方可有條件進入填海階段。然而，已開展的研究可為我們在適當時候啟動其他必要的準備工作奠定良好基礎。

（三）基於上文所述情況，政府目前沒有為交椅洲項目制定推展時間表，實際上填海工程亦未有條件於本屆政府任期內開展。"
立法會十一題：處理廢汽車輪胎,2025-09-10 12:30,2025-09-10 12:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000308.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上林素蔚議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為本港大量廢汽車輪胎被棄置在堆填區內是浪費資源，而將該等輪胎轉化為橡膠粉，並添加到傳統瀝青作鋪路物料（橡膠瀝青），既能處理廢輪胎和提升環保效益，亦可降低工務工程成本。此外，時任運輸及物流局局長在去年八月十七日的網誌中表示，路政署就應用橡膠瀝青鋪路的研究取得理想結果，並正研究更廣泛地應用該物料於道路維修工程。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）去年至今棄置於堆填區的廢汽車輪胎數量為何；

（二）過去三年，每年全港道路工程的瀝青物料的總耗用量，以及回收再造以作橡膠瀝青用途的廢輪胎數量為何；當局有否計劃全面採用橡膠瀝青鋪路，以及有否評估應用該物料鋪路的潛在減廢效益（包括全面採用該物料鋪路後每年可增加處理的廢輪胎數量）為何；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於根據路政署網頁資料，政府於今年四月起全面使用一種名為「高改性瀝青瑪蹄脂碎石混合料」的低噪音鋪路物料作鋪路用途，但該署亦表示現正實地測試橡膠瀝青以為日後應用該物料鋪路訂立準則，當局在決定選用何種鋪路物料時的主要考慮因素為何（例如是否包括技術和成本上的差異）？

答覆：

主席：

就林素蔚議員提問的各部分，經諮詢環境及生態局、環境保護署及路政署後，現回覆如下：

（一）二○二一年至二○二三年棄置於堆填區的車輛輪胎廢物總量表列如下：




年份
			（註一）
棄置於堆填區的車輛輪胎廢物總量
			（公噸）（註二）


2021

2022
16200


2023
14300



註一︰二○二四年的相關統計數字仍在編製中
註二︰包括少量不能分類的其他輪胎

（二）及（三）橡膠瀝青是一種以廢舊輪胎製成的橡膠顆粒替代部分石油瀝青的鋪路物料。早前，路政署與學界共同研究及確立了將廢棄車胎橡膠粉加入傳統瀝青物料中的技術可行性。這項技術不僅為廢棄輪胎提供了回收再造的途徑，減少堆填區負擔，同時也可減少耗用不可再生的石油資源。在上述研究的實地試驗結束後，路政署已於二○二四年將橡膠瀝青鋪路物料納入道路維修合約內，作為道路維修時可選用的物料之一，並會因應路段實際需要和成本效益配合使用。

除使用傳統瀝青和橡膠瀝青作鋪路物料外，路政署亦持續研發及引入更耐用的瀝青物料，並自二○二五年四月一日起全面應用高改性瀝青物料於合適路段作鋪路之用，以進一步提升本港整體路面質素。

路政署在決定選用何種鋪路物料時，會根據相關道路的需要及鋪路物料的成本效益等因素，從傳統瀝青物料、橡膠瀝青物料，以及高改性瀝青物料當中，選用合適的鋪路物料。一般而言，傳統瀝青和橡膠瀝青應用於非繁忙的市區及郊區道路，而高改性瀝青物料會用於交通流量高的行車路段中。舉例來說，在高改性瀝青物料中，能有效減少輪胎路面噪音的「6毫米高改性瀝青瑪蹄脂碎石混合料」特別適用於鄰近民居的市區道路路面，而透水性高的「高改性瀝青多孔摩擦層」則多適用高速公路路面。

另一方面，鋪路物料的成本效益亦是選用何種鋪路物料時的重要準則。就傳統瀝青物料及橡膠瀝青物料而言，按路政署估算，由於以橡膠瀝青物料鋪路的整體工程成本（包括建造及維修保養）比以傳統瀝青物料鋪路顯著地高，而其耐用性亦不及高改性瀝青物料。因此，考慮到其成本效益，路政署現時會在部分非繁忙的市區及郊區道路的工程中使用橡膠瀝青物料鋪路。另外，就高改性瀝青物料而言，根據路政署估算，雖然使用高改性瀝青物料的整體工程成本略高於傳統瀝青物料，高改性瀝青物料具有更優異的耐用性，能夠減低路面維修的頻率及重鋪路面工程對公眾造成的不便，從而減少社會成本。隨着路政署全面應用高改性瀝青物料於合適路段作鋪路之用，其成本亦預計將逐步下降。

過去三年，在全港工務部門所進行的道路工程下，每年耗用的瀝青物料總量平均約為33萬公噸，其中橡膠瀝青物料總量平均約為5 000公噸，當中包含約25公噸廢汽車輪胎橡膠粉。

路政署會繼續密切留意關於路面物料的最新研究、開發及實踐經驗，並適時檢視不同瀝青物料的應用計劃（包括橡膠瀝青物料），以在提升路面質素的同時，為社會帶來更大的效益。"
LCQ11: Handling of waste vehicle tyres,2025-09-10 12:30,2025-09-10 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000323.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Lam So-wai and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

There are views that the disposal of large quantities of waste vehicle tyres at landfills in Hong Kong constitutes a waste of resources. Converting such tyres into rubber powder and adding it to conventional bitumin as a road paving material (rubberised bitumin) can facilitate the handling of waste tyres, enhance environmental benefits and also reduce costs of public works projects. In addition, in a blog post on August 17 last year, the then Secretary for Transport and Logistics, indicated that the Highways Department (HyD) had achieved satisfactory results in its research on the application of rubberised bitumin in road paving and was exploring the wider use of this material in road maintenance works. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the number of waste vehicle tyres disposed of at landfills since last year;

(2) of the total consumption of bituminous materials in road works across the territory and the quantity of waste tyres recycled for use in rubberised bitumin in each of the past three years; whether the authorities have plans to fully adopt rubberised bitumin for road paving, and whether an assessment has been conducted on the potential waste reduction benefits of using this material for road paving (including the additional quantity of waste tyres that could be handled annually after its full adoption); if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) given that according to the information on the HyD's webpage, the Government has fully adopted a low noise road paving material called ""Highly Modified Stone Mastic Asphalt"" for road paving since April this year. However, the HyD has also stated that it has been conducting site trials on rubberised bitumin to formulate criteria for future application of this material in road paving, of the authorities' major considerations when deciding on the choice of road paving materials (e.g. whether technical and cost differences are included)?

Reply:

President,

In consultation with the Environment and Ecology Bureau, the Environmental Protection Department and the Highways Department (HyD), the reply to the various parts of the question raised by the Hon Lam So-wai is as follows:

(1) The total volume of vehicle tyre waste disposed of at landfills from 2021 to 2023 is tabulated as follows:




Year
			(Note 1)
Volume of vehicle tyre waste disposed of at landfills (tonnes) (Note 2)


2021
19900


2022
16200


2023
14300



Note 1: Relevant statistics for 2024 are still under compilation
Note 2: The volume includes a small volume of other tyres which cannot be classified

(2) and (3) Rubberised bituminous material is a paving material that replaces part of petroleum-based bitumen with crumb rubber made from waste tyres. The HyD, in collaboration with academia, has earlier researched and confirmed the technical feasibility of incorporating crumb rubber from waste tyres into conventional bituminous materials. Not only does this technology provide a recycling pathway for waste tyres and reduce burden on landfills, but it also lowers the consumption of non-renewable petroleum resources. Following the completion of site trials for the aforementioned research, the HyD incorporated rubberised bituminous paving materials into road maintenance contracts in 2024 as one of the optional materials for road repairs. Its application will be determined based on the actual needs of road sections and cost-effectiveness considerations.

In addition to using conventional and rubberised bituminous materials as paving materials, the HyD continues to research, develop and introduce more durable bituminous materials. Starting April 1, 2025, highly modified bituminous materials have been fully adopted for paving on suitable road sections to further enhance the overall quality of road pavement in Hong Kong.

When determining which paving material to use, the HyD selects the appropriate material from among conventional, rubberised, and highly modified bituminous paving materials taking into account factors such as the specific needs of the road and the cost-effectiveness of the paving materials. In general, conventional and rubberised bituminous materials are used on non-busy urban and rural roads, while highly modified bituminous materials are applied to high-traffic road sections. For example, among highly modified bituminous materials, the ""6 mm Highly Modified Stone Mastic Asphalt"", which effectively reduces tyre-road noise, is particularly suitable for urban road surfaces near residential areas, while the highly permeable ""Highly Modified Friction Course"" is more commonly used for highway surfaces.

On the other hand, the cost-effectiveness of paving materials is also an important criterion in selecting which paving material to use. Regarding conventional and rubberised bituminous materials, according to HyD's estimates, the overall project cost (including that of construction and maintenance) of paving with rubberised bituminous material is significantly higher than that of conventional bituminous material and its durability is lower than that of highly modified bituminous materials. Therefore, considering its cost-effectiveness, the HyD currently uses rubberised bituminous material for paving in certain non-busy urban and rural road projects. Moreover, regarding highly modified bituminous materials, according to HyD's estimates, although the overall cost is slightly higher than that of conventional bituminous materials, their better durability reduces the frequency of road maintenance and minimises the inconvenience caused by road resurfacing works to the public, thereby lowering social costs. With the full adoption of highly modified bituminous materials for suitable road sections, their costs are expected to gradually decrease.

Over the past three years, the total annual consumption of bituminous materials in road projects undertaken by public works departments in Hong Kong averaged approximately 330 000 tonnes, of which the total amount of rubberised bituminous material accounted for an average of about 5 000 tonnes. This included about 25 tonnes of crumb rubber recycled from waste tyres.

The HyD will continue to keep abreast of the latest research, development, and practical experience related to road paving materials and review the application plans for different bituminous materials (including rubberised bituminous materials) in a timely manner to enhance road pavement quality while bringing greater benefits to society."
立法會一題：確保高齡職業司機的駕駛能力,2025-09-10 12:20,2025-09-10 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000334.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上管浩鳴議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的答覆：

問題：

據報今年八月一名八旬的士司機在荃灣撞斃一名菲籍遊客，引起社會各界對高齡職業司機駕駛能力及安全的關注。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於政府至今仍未落實於二○二三年提出將商用車輛司機提交體格證明的年齡門檻降至65歲，以及「一年一檢」的建議，政府在落實該等建議上所面對的阻力為何，以及能否承諾具體的落實時間；

（二）鑑於有意見認為現時對駕駛執照申請人及持有人的體格證明要求和檢測項目過於簡單，未能確保高齡職業司機的健康狀況適宜駕駛，當局會否參考內地或台灣做法，檢討高齡職業司機的體檢要求，例如加入反應測試、慢性疾病篩查等更嚴格的檢測項目，並為醫生制訂詳細評估指引；若會，詳情為何；若否，原因為何；及

（三）會否參考內地、台灣地區或日本的做法，為職業司機訂立強制退休年齡；若會，詳情為何；若否，如何確保高齡職業司機的駕駛能力？

答覆：

主席：

政府一直重視司機的健康情況，明白駕駛人士的身體狀況對確保道路安全十分重要。隨着年長駕駛者人數逐漸增加，而商用車司機因其職業性質，相對承擔更高風險。因此，政府就《道路交通（駕駛執照）規例》（第374B章）（《規例》）對駕駛執照申請人或持有人體格證明的要求及機制進行檢討，進一步保障司機和其他道路使用者的安全。就管浩鳴議員提問的各部分，經諮詢運輸署，現回覆如下：

（一）及（二）現時，年滿70歲或以上人士在申請駕駛任何種類汽車的正式駕駛執照時，須提供一份由註冊醫生填寫及簽署的體格證明，以證明申請人的健康狀況宜於駕駛及控制該類車輛。視乎申請人的選擇，其駕駛執照有效期為一年或三年。《規例》亦訂明，如申請人患有《規例》附表1所指明的疾病或身體傷殘，運輸署署長須拒絕有關申請。

為提升道路安全，我們於二○二三年諮詢立法會交通事務委員會，建議提高商用車司機的體格證明要求。具體而言，政府建議修訂《規例》附表1，包括提高視覺能力的要求以涵蓋「視力」和「視野」，並就商用車司機增設適用項目，當中包括例如聽力要求，以提升有關要求。政府亦建議將商用車司機提交體格檢驗證明書的年齡門檻由70歲降低至65歲，並縮短其駕駛執照有效期至一年，即「一年一檢」方可續領牌照，而非商用車司機提交體格證明的要求則維持不變。

自諮詢立法會交通事務委員會後，我們持續聽取各界意見，近日亦再諮詢各持份者，包括立法會議員、運輸業界和醫學界等。社會整體支持上述方向，但有業界代表提出可否稍為放寬65歲至70歲之間的體格評估頻率，也有持份者認為應考慮增加要求司機進行反應測試，亦有醫學界代表指出要加強考慮前線醫生實務操作的情況。

因應上述較近期收集到的最新意見，運輸署委聘的香港大學顧問團隊和醫學專家小組，成員包括衞生署、醫院管理局和香港醫學專科學院及其他局和部門代表，正檢視和考慮微調《規例》附表1內所指明的疾病或身體傷殘項目，以及供醫生參考的醫療指引的內容，務求令指引更清晰、更客觀、更實用。

為確保前線醫生能充分掌握醫療指引的內容，以及日後如何進行體檢和填寫體格證明書的注意事項，同時提升商用車司機對健康的意識和對新的評估要求的理解，運輸署會參考海事處實施本地船隻操作人員健康證明要求與業界進行測試的經驗，提前在今年第四季邀請商用車業界人士參與體格評估試驗計劃，藉此收集和吸納前線醫生在實務操作方面的意見，檢視並優化整個流程。同時，在反應測試方面，我們會研究如何善用創新科技和人工智能，包括參考不同地區使用科技創新的經驗，以測試司機身體反應能力，或模擬路面情況和駕駛條件，以測試年長司機在不同情況下的駕駛反應。

具體時間表方面，我們正繼續同步積極進行法例草擬，並會進一步吸納顧問團隊和專家小組的意見，以及稍後業界和醫生參與的體格評估試驗計劃的經驗，從而在第四季敲定立法建議和醫療指引。我們計劃在明年首季向立法會交通事務委員會一併匯報結果，並向立法會提交有關的附屬法例修訂。運輸署會繼續籌備各項準備工作，包括為前線醫生製作示範短片等，爭取在明年第二季落實新的安排，提升整體道路安全水平。

（三）至於提問中為商用車司機設定退休年齡的意見，我們見到各地區的做法亦不盡相同。例如，澳洲、加拿大和英國沒有限制，內地則按年齡限制可駕駛的車種。我們認為體格評估有助預防疾病和建立健康的生活習慣。考慮到現時有近四成的士和小巴駕駛執照持有人年齡為65歲或以上，如一刀切設立退休年齡，難免對業界人手造成不必要的衝擊。政府現階段建議先加強商用車司機體格證明的要求，並會持續檢視推行的成效及予以優化。

多謝主席。"
LCQ1: Ensuring driving ability of elderly professional drivers,2025-09-10 12:20,2025-09-10 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000337.htm,"  Following is a question by Reverend Canon the Hon Peter Douglas Koon and a reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  It has been reported that in August this year, a taxi driver in his eighties struck and killed a Filipino tourist in Tsuen Wan, arousing concerns among various sectors in the community about the driving ability and safety of elderly professional drivers. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the Government has yet to implement the proposals put forward in 2023 to lower the age threshold of commercial vehicle drivers submitting physical fitness certification to the age of 65 and to require them undergoing a medical examination once every year, of the resistance the Government encounters when implementing these proposals, and whether it can commit to a specific implementation timeline;

(2) as there are views that the current physical fitness certification requirements and the examination items for driving licence applicants and holders are overly simplistic and fail to ensure the fitness of elderly professional drivers for driving, whether the authorities will review the requirements for medical examination of elderly professional drivers by drawing reference from practices on the Mainland or Taiwan, such as introducing more stringent examination items, including reaction tests and screening for chronic diseases, as well as formulating detailed assessment guidelines for doctors; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) whether it will draw on practices on the Mainland, Taiwan region or Japan to set a mandatory retirement age for professional drivers; if so, of the details; if not, how it will ensure the driving ability of elderly professional drivers?

Reply:

President,

  The Government has always attached importance to the health conditions of drivers and understands that the physical condition of drivers is of vital significance to ensuring road safety. With the increasing number of aged drivers, commercial vehicle drivers face relatively higher risks due to the nature of their profession. In this connection, the Government has conducted a review of the requirements and mechanism for medical certification of driving licence applicants or holders under the Road Traffic (Driving Licences) Regulations (Cap. 374B) (the Regulations) with a view to further safeguarding the safety of drivers and other road users. In consultation with the Transport Department (TD), the reply to the various parts of the question raised by Reverend Canon the Hon Peter Douglas Koon is as follows:

(1) and (2) Currently, when a person aged 70 or above applies for a full driving licence of any class of motor vehicle, he/she must provide a medical certificate completed and signed by a registered medical practitioner to prove that the applicant is medically fit to drive and control a vehicle in that class. Depending on applicants' choices, the validity period of such driving licences is one year or three years. The Regulations also stipulate that if an applicant is suffering from a disease or physical disability specified in the First Schedule to the Regulations, the Commissioner for Transport shall refuse the application.

  To improve road safety, we consulted the Legislative Council (LegCo) Panel on Transport in 2023, proposing to enhance the requirements for medical certification of commercial vehicle drivers. Specifically, the Government proposes amending the First Schedule to the Regulations, including raising the standards of eyesight to cover visual acuity and visual field, and adding items applicable to commercial vehicle drivers, including hearing requirements, to enhance the relevant requirements. The Government also proposes lowering the age threshold for commercial vehicle drivers to submit medical examination certificates from the age of 70 to that of 65. In addition, the validity period of their driving licences is proposed to be shortened to one year, meaning that an annual check-up is required before the licence can be renewed. Meanwhile, the requirements for non-commercial vehicles drivers to provide medical certification will remain unchanged.

  After consulting the LegCo Panel on Transport, we have kept listening to the views of all sectors. Recently, we have further consulted various stakeholders including LegCo Members, the transport trade and the medical sector, etc. While society as a whole supports the above direction, some trade representatives suggested relaxing the frequency of medical assessment for drivers aged between 65 and 70. Other stakeholders suggested that consideration should be given to requiring drivers to undergo reaction tests. Medical representatives have also pointed out the need to give greater consideration to the practical circumstances faced by frontline medical practitioners.

  In response to the latest opinions collected recently, the consultant team from the University of Hong Kong commissioned by the TD and the medical expert panel, comprising representatives from the Department of Health, the Hospital Authority, the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, and other bureaux and departments, are reviewing and considering to fine-tune the diseases or physical disabilities items specified in the First Schedule to the Regulations, as well as the content of the medical guidelines for medical practitioners' reference, with a view to making the guidelines clearer, more objective, and more practical.

  To ensure that frontline medical practitioners fully understand the contents of the medical guidelines and the points to note for conducting medical examination and completing medical certificates in the future, and to enhance commercial vehicle drivers' health awareness and their understanding of the new assessment requirements, the TD will make reference to the Marine Department's trial experience with the industry in introducing the medical fitness certificate requirement for local vessel operators, and will invite members of the commercial vehicle industry to participate in medical assessment trials ahead of schedule during the fourth quarter of this year. The trial aims to collect and incorporate practical feedback from frontline medical practitioners, thereby reviewing and enhancing the overall process. Meanwhile, as regards reaction tests, we will explore the utilisation of innovative technology and artificial intelligence, including drawing on the experiences in technological innovation across different regions to test the physical responsiveness of drivers, or to simulate various road situations and driving conditions so as to assess aged drivers' reactions under different circumstances.

  Regarding the specific timetable, we are continuing to actively pursue the law drafting in parallel and will further incorporate the views of the consultant team and the expert panel. We will also draw on the experience of medical assessment trials to be conducted shortly with the trade and medical practitioners with a view to finalising the legislative proposal and medical guidelines in the fourth quarter. We plan to report to the LegCo Panel on Transport the collective findings in the first quarter of next year, and submit the subsidiary legislation amendments to the LegCo. The TD will continue to carry out various preparatory work, including the production of demonstration video clips for frontline medical practitioners, and strive for the implementation of the new arrangement in the second quarter of next year to enhance overall road safety.

(3) As regards comments made in the question on setting a retirement age for commercial vehicle drivers, we notice that different regions have adopted various practices. For instance, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom impose no restrictions, whereas the Mainland imposes age restrictions on the types of vehicles that may be driven. We consider that medical assessment would help prevent illnesses and build healthy lifestyle habits. As currently nearly 40 percent of taxi and light bus driving licence holders are aged 65 or above, a blanket retirement age would inevitably disrupt the manpower in the trade. The Government proposes to first enhance the requirements for medical certification of commercial vehicle drivers at this stage, and will continue to review and enhance its effectiveness.

  Thank you, President."
立法會十五題：境外人士來港參加短期活動及受訓,2025-09-10 12:15,2025-09-10 12:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000302.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳祖恒議員的提問和保安局局長鄧炳強的書面答覆：

問題：

據悉隨着香港推進「八大中心」的發展，越來越多境外人士參與在香港舉辦的活動。然而，在現時制度下境外人士受邀來港參加研討會、演講、簽約、實習等短期或單次性活動需要申請工作或受訓簽證，雖然政府推出的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）可為來港參與短期活動訪客提供入境便利，但該計劃只限於獲認可主辦機構邀請／保證來港的人士。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於有業界人士反映，雖然根據入境事務處資料，審批來港就業、投資及受訓等簽證申請一般需時四星期，但其過往經驗顯示相關程序需時約六至八星期，更曾有嘉賓因簽證申請需時過久而致無法出席活動，當局會否考慮為來港參與短期或單次性活動的簽證申請訂定更明確的審批時間，以讓申請人和活動主辦機構能作出更準確的預算；

（二）至今透過短期訪客計劃來港參與指定短期活動的人數為何，並按該計劃所涵蓋的12個指定界別以下表列出分項數字；




指定界別

（三）鑑於有意見認為，隨着越來越多盛事在港舉行，現時短期訪客計劃的認可主辦機構以法定機構及政府部門為主的做法難以應付發展需要，當局會否研究優化該計劃，例如按需要分階段擴大認可主辦機構清單至涵蓋商業機構，並要求該等機構簽署聲明承諾不會濫用機制，以及引入各行業的權威性機構協助當局審批簽證的工作，以切合八大中心的發展需要；及

（四）鑑於有意見認為，隨着越來越多內地企業通過香港「走出去」，將有很多內地居民需要來港培訓，當局會否考慮擴大「來港受訓」簽證的申請資格至涵蓋所有內地居民，以進一步提升本港協助企業「出海」的專業服務的競爭力？

答覆：

主席：

政府致力鞏固和持續發展香港在「十四五」規劃下的「八大中心」定位，確保香港的競爭力和經濟發展。就入境政策而言，入境事務處（入境處）在維持有效入境管制的同時亦一直提供便捷的出入境服務以方便真正的訪客，促進更多人才匯聚香港交流。

一般而言，訪客不得在港從事有薪或無薪的工作，他們可以簽訂合約、參與短期研討會或其他會議，亦可在不受酬的情況下發表演講等。入境處的網站載有訪客獲准參與的活動的相關資訊供公眾參考：www.immd.gov.hk/hkt/services/visas/permissible-activities.html。

為促進更多人才訪港交流，政府於二○二二年六月推出為期兩年的「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利先導計劃」（先導計劃），並於二○二四年六月把先導計劃恆常化為「為來港參與指定界別短期活動的訪客提供入境便利計劃」（短期訪客計劃）。在短期訪客計劃下，獲政府相關決策局／部門認可的機構可向界別內相關的非本地人才發出邀請信，獲邀人士可以訪客身分來港參與指定短期活動，而無須向入境處申請工作簽證／進入許可。他們每次來港可在不超過連續14個曆日期間參與指定短期活動，並可就該指定活動收取報酬。

就陳議員的提問，經諮詢入境處後，我現回覆如下：

（一）一般而言，就來港就業、投資及受訓的簽證／進入許可的所有申請，入境處在收齊所需文件後，會於四星期內完成申請審批。相關申請程序及所需時間已清晰載於入境處網站。在二○二四年，99%相關簽證／進入許可申請於收齊文件後四星期內完成審批。入境處亦會因應個別情況（例如在港舉辦的大型活動），在可行情況下加快有關簽證／進入許可申請的審批。

為提供更好服務以精益求精，入境處已將簽證／進入許可的申請全面電子化，並在網頁列出所需提交文件清單，讓申請人清楚了解並可預先準備好所需文件，減少需補交文件的機會。入境處會繼續透過優化程序提高效率。

（二）及（三）截至二○二五年六月底，先導計劃／短期訪客計劃已合共惠及36 951名非本地人才，便利他們以訪客身分來港參與各項短期盛事及活動，無須向入境處申請工作簽證／進入許可。按界別的統計數字載於附件。

為確保計劃與時並進，政府不時審視計劃的涵蓋範圍及運作機制，務求使計劃能夠在風險可控的前提下，持續有效地促進相關界別發展，並提升香港的國際形象。自先導計劃推出以來，政府分別兩次在二○二三年二月以及二○二四年六月擴大計劃，在原有10個指定界別外，增加「金融」及「發展與建築」兩個新界別，認可機構亦從計劃剛推出時約350個增加18%至現時的400多個，當中包括政府決策局／部門、公營／法定機構、專業組織和業界協會等。目前，計劃下設有機制，各參與的政策局／部門均會協助把關，確保計劃的執行持續符合政策目標。

如前述，目前短期訪客計劃在公營機構以外亦涵蓋專業組織和業界協會。商業機構亦可與計劃下的認可機構合作舉辦合資格的指定短期活動，以享相關入境便利。在考慮是否進一步放寬計劃時，政府必須考慮兩大原則，包括合資格根據計劃來港進行指定短期活動的人士不會取代本地勞動力，及不會構成濫用風險（包括非法就業）。政府會繼續留意短期訪客計劃的實施情況和相關部門及業界的意見，適時檢討計劃的涵蓋範圍，以期在入境管制與便利之間取得適當平衡。我們歡迎有興趣的商業機構主動與所屬界別的相關決策局／部門或認可機構聯絡並考慮合辦合資格的活動，以期促進計劃下更多不同形式的交流合作。

（四）來港受訓入境安排的實施，為有真正需要來港接受培訓的人士提供便利，讓他們在本港汲取知識、經驗或技能，同時有助促進和鞏固香港在協助包括內地企業「走出去」的角色。

目前，設於香港而有相當規模的公司的內地業務伙伴及／或於內地分部的僱員，可申請來港受訓。在二○二五年（截至七月），內地居民獲批來港受訓的月均數字為197宗，較二○二四年（月均194宗）稍微上升。

政府會繼續不時檢視來港受訓入境安排以確保該安排持續符合目標和香港的發展需要。"
LCQ15: Non-local people coming to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities and receive training,2025-09-10 12:15,2025-09-10 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000310.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Sunny Tan and a written reply by the Secretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

It is learnt that with Hong Kong advancing the development of the ""eight centres"", an increasing number of non-local people are participating in activities held in Hong Kong. However, under the current system, non-local people coming to Hong Kong at invitation to participate in short-‍term or one-off activities, such as seminars, talks, contract signings and internships, must apply for employment or training visas. Although the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (the STV Scheme) launched by the Government can provide immigration facilitation for visitors coming to Hong Kong to participate in short-term activities, the Scheme is only for persons invited/sponsored by authorised host organisations. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) as some members of the industry have relayed that although the Immigration Department states the standard processing time for visa applications for employment, investment, training, etc. in Hong Kong is typically four weeks, their past experience shows that the relevant procedures take about six to eight weeks, and that there have even been instances where guests were unable to attend activities due to the unduly long time required for processing visa applications, whether the authorities will consider setting a more specific timeframe for processing visa applications for those coming to Hong Kong to participate in short-term or one-off activities, so as to enable applicants and activity organisers to make more accurate plans;

(2) of the up-to-date number of persons who have come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities through the STV Scheme, and set out in the table below a breakdown by the 12 designated sectors under the Scheme;




Designated sector
2022
2023
2024
2025 to date


Medical and Healthcare






Higher Education






Arts and Culture






Sports






Heritage






Creative Industries






Innovation and Technology






Hong Kong Laureate Forum






Aviation






International / Mega Events






Finance






Development and Construction








(3) as there are views that with an increasing number of mega events being held in Hong Kong, the current practice of having statutory bodies and government departments as the main authorised host organisations under the STV Scheme can hardly meet development needs, whether the authorities will consider optimising the Scheme, for example by phasing in the expansion of the list of authorised host organisations to include commercial organisations as necessary, requiring such organisations to sign declarations pledging not to abuse the mechanism, and enlisting authoritative organisations in various industries to assist the authorities in processing visa applications, so as to meet the development needs of the ""eight centres""; and

(4) as there are views that with more and more Mainland enterprises ""going global"" through Hong Kong, many Mainland residents will need to receive training in Hong Kong, whether the authorities will consider extending the eligibility criteria for visas to undergo training in Hong Kong to cover all Mainland residents, so as to further enhance the competitiveness of Hong Kong's professional services in assisting enterprises to expand overseas?

Reply:

President,

The Government is committed to consolidating and continuously enhancing Hong Kong's development of the ""eight centres"" as outlined in the 14th Five-Year Plan, providing impetus for sustaining our competitiveness and economic growth. In connection with immigration policies, the Immigration Department (ImmD) has been maintaining effective immigration control while providing convenient immigration services to facilitate genuine visitors so as to promote greater convergence of talents in Hong Kong for exchanges.

In general, visitors shall not take any employment, whether paid or unpaid, in Hong Kong. They may conclude contracts, attend short term seminars or other business meetings, and deliver speeches without remuneration. The ImmD's website contains relevant information on permissible activities for visitors for public reference: www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/visas/permissible-activities.html.

To encourage more talents to come to Hong Kong for exchanges, the Government launched a two-year Pilot Scheme on Immigration Facilitation for Visitors Participating in Short-term Activities in Designated Sectors (Pilot Scheme) in June 2022, which was regularised as the Immigration Facilitation Scheme for Visitors Participating in Short term Activities in Designated Sectors (STV Scheme) in June 2024. Under the STV Scheme, organisations authorised by the relevant government bureaux/departments (B/Ds) can issue invitation letters to relevant non-local talents in their sectors. Invited persons may come to Hong Kong to participate in specified short-term activities as visitors without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the ImmD. They may participate in specified short term activities for up to 14 consecutive calendar days during each trip to Hong Kong, and receive remuneration for the specified activities concerned.

In consultation with the ImmD, my reply to various parts of the question raised by the Hon Sunny Tan is as follows:

(1) In general, for all visa/entry permit applications for employment, investment and training in Hong Kong, the ImmD will complete processing within four weeks upon receipt of all required documents. The application procedures and processing times are clearly set out on ImmD's website. In 2024, 99 per cent of the relevant visa/entry permit applications could be completed within four weeks upon receipt of all required documents. The ImmD will also expedite the processing of relevant visa/entry permit applications as far as practicable, taking into account individual circumstances (e.g. applications related to mega events in Hong Kong).

To provide better services and strive for excellence, the ImmD has launched electronic services for visa/entry permit applications in full. A list setting out the required documents is also available on the ImmD's website to give applicants a clear picture of what is required for the application so that they can prepare the required documents in advance, thereby minimising the chance of submitting supplementary documents. The ImmD will continue to enhance efficiency through process optimisation.

(2) and (3) As of end-June 2025, the Pilot Scheme/STV Scheme had benefited a total of 36 951 non-local talents, facilitating their entry into Hong Kong as visitors to participate in various short-term events and activities without the need to apply for employment visas/entry permits from the ImmD. The statistics by sector are at Annex.

To ensure that the Scheme keeps pace with the times, the Government reviews its coverage and operation mechanism from time to time, with a view to ensuring that it can continue to effectively promote the development of relevant sectors and raise Hong Kong's international profile while ensuring that the risks are manageable. Since the launch of the Pilot Scheme, the Government has expanded the Scheme twice in February 2023 and June 2024, by adding two new sectors, namely ""Finance"" and ""Development and Construction"", to the original 10 designated sectors. The number of authorised organisations has also increased by 18 per cent from around 350 when the scheme was first launched, to more than 400 at present. These authorised organisations include government B/Ds, public/statutory organisations, professional bodies and industry associations, etc. At present, through an established mechanism, all participating B/Ds would assist in ensuring that the implementation of the scheme consistently meets policy objectives.

As mentioned above, the STV Scheme currently extends beyond the public sector and encompasses professional bodies and industry associations. Commercial organisations may also collaborate with authorised organisations under the Scheme to organise eligible specified short-term activities, thereby benefiting from the relevant immigration facilitation. In considering whether to further relax the scheme, the Government shall take into account two major principles, including that eligible individuals visiting Hong Kong for specified short-term activities under the Scheme will not displace the local workforce, and there will not be a risk of abuse (including illegal employment). The Government will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the STV Scheme as well as the views of the relevant departments and the sectors concerned, and timely review the Scheme's coverage to strike an appropriate balance between immigration control and facilitation. We welcome interested commercial organisations to contact relevant B/Ds or authorised organisations in their respective sectors and consider co-organising eligible events, with a view to promoting more diverse forms of exchange and collaboration under the Scheme.

(4) The implementation of the entry arrangement for training facilitates individuals with genuine needs to enter Hong Kong for training, enabling them to acquire local knowledge, experience or skills. It also helps promote and consolidate Hong Kong's role in assisting Mainland enterprises in ""going global"".

Currently, Mainland business associates and/or employees of Mainland branches of well-established companies in Hong Kong may apply to enter Hong Kong for training. In 2025 (as at July), the monthly average number of cases involving Mainland residents approved for entry to Hong Kong for training was 197, representing a slight increase from 2024 which recorded a monthly average of 194 cases.

The Government will continue to timely review the entry arrangement for training in Hong Kong to ensure that the arrangement remains consistent with the objectives and the development needs of Hong Kong."
立法會八題：推動「一帶一路」建設,2025-09-10 12:04,2025-09-10 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000165.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上馬逢國議員的提問和商務及經濟發展局局長丘應樺的書面答覆：

問題：

香港一直積極參與「一帶一路」的發展機遇。特區政府不時組織官方和商界考察團前往有關國家／地區進行考察，並連續第10年在香港舉行「一帶一路高峰論壇」。就推動「一帶一路」建設，政府可否告知本會：

（一）特區政府在來年有否組織考察團的計劃；如有，詳情為何，以及有否前往「一帶一路」沿線70多個國家／地區考察的計劃；

（二）鑑於特區政府正積極推進在沙特阿拉伯利雅得和馬來西亞吉隆坡設立經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦），有關工作的進度為何；當局有否為擬申請到該兩個經貿辦工作的人員提供有關伊斯蘭文化的培訓，或聘請信仰為伊斯蘭教的人員派駐該兩個經貿辦；

（三）為加深港人及企業對「一帶一路」國家／地區的認識，除舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」外，政府有否計劃舉行有關「一帶一路」沿線國家／地區的政治、經濟、社會和人文風俗的介紹課程；

（四）鑑於有意見認為，「一帶一路」沿線國家／地區擁有自身的獨特文化與藝術基因，過去三年，每年特區政府有否與該等國家／地區進行文化藝術的交流，以確立香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的角色；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（五）過去一年，「一帶一路」辦公室在推動香港與「一帶一路」沿線國家／地區合作交流及經貿往來的工作成績為何？

答覆：

主席：

香港是共建「一帶一路」的積極參與者、貢獻者及受益者，一直全面參與和助力共建「一帶一路」，擔當好香港作為「一帶一路」功能平台的角色，致力發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」作用，深化國際交往合作，協助香港企業與專業界別拓展「一帶一路」機遇。

就馬逢國議員的提問，經諮詢各相關政策局後，我現回覆如下：

（一）政府會繼續積極外訪「一帶一路」國家等重點市場，率領工商界及專業服務界到當地市場考察，推廣香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，用好香港「引進來、走出去」的橋樑作用，為香港企業（包括中小企和專業服務）開拓更多商機。

（二）現時，特區政府在海外設立14個香港駐海外經濟貿易辦事處（經貿辦）。我們會繼續擴闊經貿辦網絡，吸引更多「全球南方」的企業和投資。其中，我們正與馬來西亞和沙特阿拉伯政府積極跟進開設經貿辦的計劃。我們會按既定機制安排合適的人員出任經貿辦的職位。一般來說，經貿辦的人手包括香港派駐人員，以及熟悉當地文化、語言等的當地僱員。

（三）「一帶一路」辦公室於今年二月十四日舉辦「一帶一路跨專業論壇」，吸引逾250名來自本港、內地和「一帶一路」國家的商界人士出席進行高層次交流，並展示多項「一帶一路」商業案例和潛在項目，推廣香港專業服務。「一帶一路」辦公室亦自二○二三年十一月起舉辦了10次交流會，以及通過短片、傳媒訪問及社交媒體，邀請「一帶一路」國家的駐香港總領事、專業團體和企業代表及青年代表分享「一帶一路」的機遇及相關經驗。另外，我們已在「一帶一路」辦公室網頁統整政府及相關機構的「一帶一路」主題活動，鼓勵相關企業和專業界別及市民參與。

公務員學院（學院）舉辦的本地及內地課程都會涵蓋「一帶一路」發展的相關內容，以加深公務員對這項重要國家戰略的理解。例如「聯通世界：東盟系列」講座和「撮合南北：多極世界中的中國系列」講座，邀請來自各地包括「一帶一路」國家的領袖和專家，講解相關國家／地區的發展，以及與香港的合作和聯繫。學院亦繼續與外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署合辦「國家外交事務系列」講座，其中內容包括「一帶一路」倡議等重要議題。

（四）特區政府一直致力推動文化藝術發展，提升香港文化軟實力及影響力，並配合國家的整體文化發展策略，鞏固香港作為中外文化藝術交流中心的地位。文化體育及旅遊局（文體旅局）、康樂及文化事務署（康文署）、文創產業發展處（文創處）及西九文化區管理局（西九管理局）一直積極與「一帶一路」國家進行文化藝術交流。

文體旅局每年撥款資助香港藝團／藝術家在海外舉辦文化藝術活動，包括「一帶一路」相關國家。康文署則在內地與海外城市舉辦「香港周」，促進香港與「一帶一路」地區的文化交流。繼二○二三年於泰國曼谷舉辦「香港周」後，今年「香港周」將於九月至十月於韓國首爾舉行。

另一方面，康文署策劃「亞藝無疆」藝術節等活動，邀請海外藝團／藝術家來港演出。康文署和西九管理局亦與內地和海外的博物館合作，在香港舉辦大型展覽和相關的學術及專業交流活動，並商議提供珍貴文物赴港展出。

此外，文體旅局和康文署在香港舉辦大型國際會議論壇或平台，包括亞洲文化合作論壇+、博物館高峰論壇、香港演藝博覽等，匯聚來自內地和「一帶一路」等國家的文化部長、高層官員、文化領袖和專業人士，就推廣文化藝術發展交流良方善策，及促進境內外同業的交流及業務商談合作，充分展現香港「超級聯繫人」及中外文化藝術交流中心的角色。

西九管理局也一直積極與「一帶一路」國家合作並把世界級展覽「走出去」，例如，香港故宮文化博物館與多哈伊斯蘭藝術博物館合作舉辦特別展覽；M+策展的「貝聿銘：人生如建築」特別展覽將在多哈卡塔爾博物館阿爾里瓦克展覽館展出。

創意產業方面，文創處透過「創意智優計劃」及電影發展基金，資助香港文創業界參加「一帶一路」國家／地區的交流及業務配對活動，例如在泰國曼谷、印尼雅加達及馬來西亞吉隆坡舉行的大型潮玩展覽，及支持本地電視台與「一帶一路」國家／地區的電視台聯合製作綜藝電視節目；亦會邀請「一帶一路」國家／地區同業參與本地文創產業相關活動，推動跨地域文創產業交流及合作，並支持本地業界與「一帶一路」國家／地區業界合作。

（五）過去一年，政府繼續通過多元措施深化與「一帶一路」國家的合作，包括：

（a）拓展經貿網絡

政府繼續拓展經貿網絡，協助港商及投資者開拓「一帶一路」市場，以促進香港的長遠經濟發展。我們正與馬來西亞和沙特阿拉伯政府積極跟進開設經貿辦的計劃。投資推廣署於二○二四年七月在埃及開羅開設顧問辦事處，而該署在土耳其第三大城市伊茲密爾的顧問辦事處亦已於今年一月投入運作，致力開拓區內新興市場；

（b）商簽雙邊協議

香港與33個海外經濟體（包括「一帶一路」沿線經濟體）簽訂了24份促進和保護投資協定（投資協定），包括巴林、科威特、土耳其及阿拉伯聯合酋長國。香港與卡塔爾已大致完成投資協定談判，並正與沙特阿拉伯、孟加拉國、埃及和秘魯探討簽訂投資協定。此外，香港與53個稅務管轄區（包括37個「一帶一路」沿線稅務管轄區）簽訂全面性避免雙重課稅協定；

「一帶一路」辦公室亦於今年八月二十九日與沙特阿拉伯投資部簽署合作諒解備忘錄，加強在基礎建設及建築相關領域的資訊交流，並由沙特阿拉伯投資部為香港相關專業服務進入當地市場提供支持；

（c）組織外訪考察

二○二四年五月十六日至二十五日，「一帶一路」辦公室聯同國家商務部「聯合走出去」，率領內地與香港經貿代表團共約70人訪問匈牙利及哈薩克斯坦，回港取道新疆，推動香港與內地企業和香港專業服務共同開拓「一帶一路」市場。港方代表團共簽署10份合作備忘錄，涵蓋市場拓展、金融支付科技、初創企業生態圈、投資合作和物流等；

二○二四年七月二十八日至八月二日，行政長官率領45人組成的代表團訪問老撾、柬埔寨及越南，共簽署了55份合作備忘錄和協議，涵蓋貿易和經濟合作、投資、海關合作、教育、物流合作、旅遊推廣、科技合作、航空服務，以及金融、銀行和資本市場發展等範疇；

二○二四年十月二十八日至三十一日，財政司司長率領超過100人組成的金融及創科界的商務代表團訪問沙特阿拉伯，加強和深化香港與中東地區在經貿、金融和創科等方面聯繫，並出席第八屆「未來投資倡議大會」，以及促成了一系列合作項目；

二○二四年十二月四日至六日，商務及經濟發展局局長率領商務代表團前往新疆烏魯木齊。其間，代表團成員出席中國（新疆、香港）—哈薩克斯坦合作對接會，推介香港優勢，促進與新疆和哈薩克斯坦的經貿及人文合作，共同開拓「一帶一路」的全方位機遇；

今年五月十日至十五日，行政長官率領50多位香港商貿代表和內地企業代表組成的商貿代表團前往卡塔爾和科威特訪問，目的是要與中東地區進一步建立政府之間的關係、開拓合作領域，以及交朋友，擴大「朋友圈」。是次出訪成果豐碩，包括達成了共59項合作備忘錄和協議合作，涵蓋經貿、投資、金融服務、科技、法律、物流、航空服務、專上教育等範疇，以及進一步建立與海灣阿拉伯國家合作委員會國家的關係；

今年六月二十二日至二十六日，「一帶一路」專員率領代表團訪問印尼和馬來西亞，推廣香港基礎建設和建築相關的專業服務，開拓合作機遇。代表團在兩地出席重點工程項目簡介會，與當地企業代表直接交流，洽談投資和合作的具體商機。代表團亦與印尼和馬來西亞的夥伴簽訂21份合作備忘錄，涵蓋商貿合作和專業服務交流等多個範疇；以及

（d）舉辦重點活動

商務及經濟發展局會繼續積極通過舉辦各項重點活動推介香港優勢並促進香港與「一帶一路」國家的企業對接及項目參與。香港自二○一六年起每年舉辦「一帶一路高峰論壇」，是國家認可為共建「一帶一路」構建人類命運共同體的重大實踐案例。今年九月十日至十一日舉辦的第十屆論壇，主題為「合作求變‧共建未來」，預計吸引約6 000名來自「一帶一路」國家和地區的政商領袖出席，並促成多份合作備忘錄，同時多個機構亦在論壇前後舉辦活動以加強協同效應。「一帶一路」辦公室於二○二四年四月為沙特阿拉伯的NEOM新未來城協辦「發現NEOM」香港路演活動，吸引來自內地及香港的相關企業、投資者和專業服務代表共約1 100人次參加，而「一帶一路」辦公室在活動期間舉辦了兩場商貿接會，促進40間香港及內地的企業與NEOM共同探討合作。部分其他活動已載於上文第（三）部分的回覆。"
LCQ8: Promoting implementation of Belt and Road Initiative,2025-09-10 12:04,2025-09-10 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000166.htm," Following is a question by the Hon Ma Fung-kwok and a written reply by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

 Hong Kong has been actively participating in the development opportunities presented by the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI). The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government regularly organises official and business delegations to conduct visits to relevant countries/regions, and has hosted the Belt and Road Summit in Hong Kong for 10 consecutive years. Regarding the promotion of the implementation of the B&RI, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) whether the Hong Kong SAR Government has plans to organise delegations in the coming year; if so, of the details, and whether there are plans to conduct visits to over 70 countries/regions along the Belt and Road;

(2) given that the Hong Kong SAR Government is actively pursuing the establishment of Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, of the progress of the relevant work; whether the authorities have provided training on Islamic culture for personnel intending to apply for posts at these two ETOs, or recruited Muslim personnel to be posted to these two ETOs;

(3) to enhance the understanding of Hong Kong people and enterprises about the Belt and Road countries/regions, apart from hosting the Belt and Road Summit, whether the Government has plans to organise introductory courses on the politics, economy, society and cultural customs of the countries/regions along the Belt and Road;

(4) as there are views that the Belt and Road countries/regions possess their own unique cultural and artistic heritage, whether the Hong Kong SAR Government engaged in cultural and artistic exchanges with these countries/regions in each of the past three years, so as to establish Hong Kong's role as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(5) of the achievements made by the Belt and Road Office over the past year in promoting the co-operation and exchanges, as well as the economic ties between Hong Kong and countries/regions along the Belt and Road?

Reply:

President,

 Hong Kong is an active participant, contributor and beneficiary of the Belt and Road Initiative (B&RI). We have been fully participating in and contributing to the B&RI, utilising the role as a functional platform for the Belt and Road (B&R) and serving our role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", thereby deepening international exchanges and co-operation as well as assisting Hong Kong companies and professional sectors to explore the B&R opportunities.

 In consultation with relevant bureaux, the consolidated reply to the Hon Ma Fung-kwok's question is as follows:

(1) The Government will continue to pay visits and lead business and professional services delegations to priority markets such as the B&R countries, promoting Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" and acting as a bridge to serve enterprises in going global and attracting external investment, to open up more business opportunities for Hong Kong companies (including small and medium enterprises and professional services).

(2) Currently, the Government has 14 overseas Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices (ETOs). We will continue to expand our ETO network and attract more inward investment and enterprises from the Global South markets to Hong Kong. In this regard, the Government is following up actively with the governments of Malaysia and Saudi Arabia on the establishment of ETOs in these two countries. We will arrange suitable officers to take up positions in the ETOs in accordance with the established mechanism. Generally speaking, the ETOs' manpower comprises Hong Kong-based officers and local staff who are familiar with local culture, language, etc.

(3) The Belt and Road Office (BRO) held the Belt and Road Cross-professional Forum on February 14, 2025, which attracted over 250 business participants from Hong Kong, the Mainland and B&R countries to engage in high-level exchanges and showcased a number of B&R business cases and potential projects, to promote Hong Kong's professional services. Since November 2023, the BRO has organised 10 exchange sessions and has made use of short videos, media interviews and social media, inviting Consuls-General from the B&R countries in Hong Kong as well as representatives of professional bodies, enterprises and youths to share the opportunities and relevant experience in the B&R countries. In addition, we have consolidated the B&R-themed activities of the Government and relevant organisations onto the BRO's website to encourage participation by relevant companies, professional sectors and members of the public.

 Both local and Mainland programmes organised by the Civil Service College (CSC) cover topics related to the development of the B&RI to enable civil servants to gain a deeper understanding of this important national strategy. For example, the Executive Series on ""Connecting with the World - ASEAN"" and the Executive Series on ""Brokering North and South: China in a Multipolar World"" invite leaders and experts from around the world, including those from the B&R countries, to share insights on the development of relevant countries/regions and their collaborations and connections with Hong Kong. The CSC also continues to collaborate with the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to run a series of talks on the country's foreign affairs, which also cover important topics including the B&RI.

(4) The Government has been committed to promoting the development of arts and culture, enhancing Hong Kong's cultural soft power and influence, and consolidating Hong Kong's position as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, in line with our nation's overall policy on cultural development. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau (CSTB), the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency (CCIDA) and the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority (WKCDA) have been actively engaging in arts and cultural exchanges with countries along the B&R.

 Every year, the CSTB provides funding for Hong Kong arts groups/artists to organise arts and cultural events on the Mainland and overseas, including relevant B&R countries. The LCSD organises the Hong Kong Week on the Mainland and overseas cities to promote cultural exchange between Hong Kong and the B&R region. Following its staging in Bangkok in 2023, the Hong Kong Week will be held in Seoul, Korea from September to October this year.

 On another front, the LCSD organises such activities as the Asia+ Festival, inviting overseas arts groups/artists to perform in Hong Kong. The LCSD and the WKCDA also collaborate with museums on the Mainland and overseas to organise large-scale exhibitions, academic and professional related exchange activities in Hong Kong, and to explore opportunities for bringing in precious cultural relics to Hong Kong for display.

 In addition, the CSTB and the LCSD organise large-scale international summits, forums or platforms, including the Asia Cultural Co-operation Forum, the Museum Summit and the Hong Kong Performing Arts Expo, etc, which gather cultural ministers, senior officials, cultural leaders and professionals from the Mainland and B&R countries to exchange views on strategies in promoting arts and cultural development, as well as facilitate exchanges and business negotiations of industry players of different places, fully demonstrating Hong Kong's role of a ""super connector"" and East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

 The WKCDA has also been actively collaborating with countries along the B&R and bringing world-class exhibitions overseas. For instance, the Hong Kong Palace Museum collaborated with the Museum of Islamic Art, a part of Qatar Museums, to present a special exhibition, while the special exhibition ""I. M. Pei: Life is Architecture"" curated by M+ will be staged at Qatar Museums Gallery, Al Riwaq in Doha.

 On creative industries, the CCIDA, through the CreateSmart Initiative and the Film Development Fund, funds various creative sectors in Hong Kong to participate in exchange and business-matching activities in the B&R countries/regions, such as large-scale art toy exhibitions in Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), and supports local television stations to co-produce variety television programmes with stations from the B&R countries/regions. The CCIDA also invites counterparts from the B&R countries/regions to participate in relevant activities in Hong Kong, so as to promote cross-regional exchange and collaboration in the cultural and creative industries, and supports the collaboration of local sectors and those from the B&R countries/regions.

(5) In the past year, the Government continued to deepen the co-operation with the B&R countries through a range of measures, including:

(a) Expanding economic and trade networks

 The Government continues to expand our economic and trade networks, with a view to assisting Hong Kong enterprises and investors in expanding into the B&R markets and promoting the long-term economic development of Hong Kong. The Government is actively following up on the establishment of an ETO in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. Invest Hong Kong set up a consultant office in Cairo, Egypt in July 2024, and its consultant office in Izmir, Türkiye's third largest city, commenced operation in January this year to explore emerging markets in the region;

(b) Negotiating and signing bilateral agreements

 Hong Kong has signed 24 Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (IPPAs) with 33 overseas economies (including B&R economies), including Bahrain, Kuwait, Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates. Hong Kong has substantially concluded negotiations on an IPPA with Qatar and is exploring the signing of IPPAs with Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Egypt and Peru. In addition, Hong Kong has signed Comprehensive Avoidance of Double Taxation Agreements with 53 jurisdictions (including 37 B&R jurisdictions);

 The BRO has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (MISA) on August 29, 2025, to enhance information exchange in relation to the fields of infrastructure and construction, and for MISA to provide support to related professional services in Hong Kong to access the Saudi Arabian market;

(c) Organising outbound visits

 From May 16 to 25, 2024, the BRO and the Ministry of Commerce co-led an around 70-strong Hong Kong cum Mainland business delegation to visit Hungary and Kazakhstan, and returned via Xinjiang, encouraging Hong Kong and Mainland enterprises as well as Hong Kong's professional services in jointly exploring the B&R markets. The Hong Kong delegation signed 10 MOUs, covering areas including market collaboration, financial payment technology, start-up ecosystem, investment co-operation and logistics;

  From July 28 to August 2, 2024, the Chief Executive (CE) led a 45-strong delegation to visit Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, with a total of 55 MOUs and agreements signed in areas including trade and economic partnerships, investment, customs collaboration, education, logistics co-operation, tourism promotions, technological co-operation, aviation services, as well as financial, banking and capital market development;

 From October 28 to 31, 2024, the Financial Secretary led a business delegation of over 100 members, including representatives from the finance as well as innovation and technology (I&T) sectors, on a visit to Saudi Arabia to strengthen and deepen connections between Hong Kong and the Middle East in trade, finance and I&T, as well as participate in the 8th Future Investment Initiative Conference, and facilitated a number of joint projects;

 From December 4 to 6, 2024, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development led a business delegation to Urumqi, Xinjiang, during which delegation members attended a co-operation and exchange forum between China (Xinjiang, Hong Kong) and Kazakhstan to promote Hong Kong's advantages, as well as promote economic and trade co-operation and people-to-people exchanges with Xinjiang and Kazakhstan, with a view to jointly exploring the full range of opportunities arising from the B&RI;

 From May 10 to 15, 2025, the CE led a delegation of more than 50 representatives from the business community of Hong Kong and Mainland enterprises to visit Qatar and Kuwait. The major goals for the mission were to strengthen government-to-government relations, to explore new areas of co-operation, and to make friends and expand our network. The mission yielded fruitful results, including reaching a total of 59 MOUs and agreements covering trade, investment, financial services, technology, legal, logistics, aviation services, post-secondary education, etc, and further building relations with the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf countries;

 From June 22 to 26, 2025, the Commissioner for Belt and Road led a delegation to Indonesia and Malaysia to promote Hong Kong's professional services related to infrastructure and construction and to explore opportunities for co-operation. The delegation attended presentations of signature projects in the two places, directly connecting with representatives of local enterprises to explore commercially viable investment and co-operation. The delegation also signed 21 MOUs with their partners in Indonesia and Malaysia, covering such areas as business collaboration and exchanges in professional services; and

(d) Organising major events

 The Commerce and Economic Development Bureau will continue to actively organise various major events to promote Hong Kong's advantages and facilitate business matching and project participation between Hong Kong and the B&R countries. Hong Kong has been organising the Belt and Road Summit annually since 2016, and the Summit has been recognised by our country as a case of significance for the implementation of the B&RI in building a global community of shared future. The 10th Summit is being held on September 10 and 11, 2025, under the theme ""Collaborate for Change • Shape a Shared Future"", and is expected to attract around 6 000 government officials and business leaders from the B&R countries and regions, as well as facilitate a number of MOUs. A number of organisations will also organise events around the Summit period for greater synergies. In April 2024, the BRO partnered with NEOM of Saudi Arabia to organise the ""Discover NEOM Hong Kong"" roadshow, which attracted around 1 100 participants, including enterprises, investors and professional representatives from the Mainland and Hong Kong. During the roadshow, the BRO organised two business matching sessions, facilitating potential collaborations between 40 Hong Kong and Mainland enterprises and NEOM. Some other major events have been covered in the reply to part (3) above."

​立法會十四題：構建數據交易生態,2025-09-10 11:51,2025-09-10 12:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000266.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上廖長江議員的提問和創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授的書面答覆：

問題：

財政司司長在2024-2025財政年度的《財政預算案》中表示，政府已委託專家組，就如何為香港構建良好的數據交易生態進行深入研究。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）鑑於《粵港澳大灣區（內地、香港）個人信息跨境流動標準合同》（《大灣區標準合同》）便利措施已於去年十一月一日擴展至各行業，以促進粵港澳大灣區個人信息跨境安全流動，目前參與《大灣區標準合同》的企業數目及其所屬行業詳情為何；

（二）政府會否研究成立香港數據交易所，並建立一套完整的數據市場交易制度，包括數據格式標準化、數據定價機制、分類分級保護規則、安全保護機制、數據權屬界定等，以促進數據要素市場化；如會，詳情為何；如否，原因為何；及

（三）鑑於有意見認為，隨着內地積極開拓數據交易市場，跨境數據交易相關的法律糾紛（例如數據存儲、處理、權屬和交易等環節）可能會持續增加，政府如何發揮香港作為「超級聯繫人」及國際仲裁中心的優勢，建立跨境數據交易爭議解決機制，為構建良好的數據交易生態奠定良好基礎？

答覆：

主席：

就廖議員的提問，經諮詢律政司後，我現回覆如下：

（一）創新科技及工業局與國家互聯網信息辦公室於二○二三年六月簽訂《促進粵港澳大灣區數據跨境流動的合作備忘錄》，並於二○二三年十二月共同發布《粵港澳大灣區（內地、香港）個人信息跨境流動標準合同》（《大灣區標準合同》）便利措施，以促進大灣區內地城市的個人信息跨境流動到香港及簡化有關安排。

《大灣區標準合同》便利措施首先於銀行、信貸資料及醫療業界先行先試，運作暢順並獲得業界正面評價。自二○二四年十一月，《大灣區標準合同》便利措施已推展至各行各業，恆常化推行。截至二○二五年八月底，數字政策辦公室已處理約100份備案申請，涉及醫療、徵信、保險、證券及印刷等不同行業。各行業備案數目比例如下：




行業
佔比


醫療業
24%


徵信業
16%


保險業
14%


證券業
9%


印刷業
9%


科技業
8%


銀行業
7%


其他
12%




（二）隨着全球數字化轉型加速，數據已成為關鍵的生產要素，而高效的數據生態圈正是吸引企業落戶香港的重要因素之一。香港憑藉在一國兩制下的獨特優勢，以及國際化的特點，從數據的供需到應用場景，都具備優厚的基礎和條件促進數據生態圈的發展。

財政司司長於二○二四至二五年度《財政預算案》中宣布委託專家組，包括資訊科技、工商、金融、數據源等界別的專家，研究如何為香港構建良好的數據交易生態，包括香港在數據交易中作為超級連接人的角色、推動國際數據貿易的先決條件、規則及措施，以及可行的推行模式等。研究亦涵蓋與數據交易有關的重要議題，包括數據格式標準化、數據定價機制、數據安全保護等。專家組正就上述議題進行顧問研究，預計於二○二五至二六年度內完成並向政府提交建議。

（三）解決跨境數據流動（包括透過自願採用《大灣區標準合同》模式）可能引起的法律問題及爭議，需視乎合約雙方所協議的安排及其他適用的法規。以《大灣區標準合同》為例，合同範本條文已訂明合同雙方如有爭議，應當協商解決；協商解決不成的，則可選擇以訴訟或仲裁解決。若選擇仲裁，爭議可提交香港國際仲裁中心等仲裁機構，按適用的仲裁規則在香港進行仲裁，為粵港澳大灣區跨境數據流動提供可行的爭端解決途徑。

在加強香港作為國際仲裁中心的優勢方面，香港一直致力推動網上爭議解決及交易促成服務。根據律政司提供的資料，二○一八年《施政報告》提出支持發展網上平台，以便在香港提供高效率及具成本效益的網上爭議解決服務，一邦國際網上仲調中心（eBRAM中心）因而成立。eBRAM中心自二○二二年起推出網上平台，包括「亞太經濟合作組織網上爭議解決平台」、「網上調解平台」及「網上仲裁平台」，為身處世界任何地方的各方提供高效、具成本效益和安全的網上爭議解決服務。為便利企業進行跨境商業交易以及拓展跨境業務，eBRAM中心於二○二三年十二月推出「網上交易促成平台」。截至二○二五年八月，超過550家不同類別的企業（包括來自香港、內地及其他地區的法律、專業及商業服務、資訊科技等行業）已加入交易促成平台。

就粵港澳大灣區而言，律政司在二○二四年四月首次發布《粵港澳大灣區法治建設行動綱領》，積極支持建立及推廣大灣區內通用的線上爭議解決平台。eBRAM中心於二○二四年七月推出大灣區在線爭議解決機構協作平台的主題網站，提供一站式有關大灣區內爭議解決服務的資訊，以整合大灣區仲調資源。協作平台至今載有與14個機構簽署的合作備忘錄。

政府相信香港可憑藉其作為國際法律服務及爭議解決中心的優勢，尤其在仲裁及調解服務方面的專業能力與制度基礎，繼續優化爭議解決機制，為解決跨境商業糾紛，包括跨境數據流動所引致的糾紛，構建更完善的生態。政府將繼續密切留意相關發展趨勢，適時作出研究，並與法律及爭議解決業界持份者保持溝通。政府亦會適時加強與內地法律界的交流協作，推動區域層面的經驗分享。"
LCQ14: Building a data trading ecosystem,2025-09-10 11:51,2025-09-10 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000277.htm,"Following is a question by the Hon Martin Liao and a written reply by the Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry, Professor Sun Dong, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  The Financial Secretary has indicated in the 2024-2025 Budget that the Government has commissioned an expert group to undertake an in depth study on how to develop a robust data trading ecosystem in Hong Kong. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that the facilitation measure on the Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information Within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong) (the GBA Standard Contract) has been extended to all sectors since November 1 last year to facilitate the safe cross-boundary flow of personal information within the GBA, of the current number of enterprises participating in the GBA Standard Contract and the details of their respective industries;

(2) whether the Government will explore the setting up of a data exchange in Hong Kong and the development of a comprehensive data market trading system, including standardised data format, data pricing mechanisms, categorised and hierarchical rules for data protection, data security protection mechanisms, definition of data ownership, etc., with a view to enhancing the marketisation of data elements; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that; and

(3) as there are views that, following the active development of the data trading market in the Mainland, more legal disputes relating to cross-boundary data trading (such as those concerning data storage, processing, ownership, and trading) may arise constantly, how will the Government capitalise on Hong Kong's strengths as a ""super connector"" and an international arbitration centre to establish a cross-boundary data trading dispute resolution mechanism, thereby laying a solid foundation for developing a robust data trading ecosystem?

Reply:

President,

  Having consulted the Department of Justice (DoJ), our reply to the questions raised by the Hon Martin Liao is as follows:

(1) The Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau and the Cyberspace Administration of China signed the ""Memorandum of Understanding on Facilitating Cross-boundary Data Flow within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area"" in June 2023, and jointly announced the facilitation measure on the ""Standard Contract for the Cross-boundary Flow of Personal Information within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Mainland, Hong Kong)"" (the GBA Standard Contract) in December 2023 to facilitate cross boundary flow of personal information from the Mainland cities in the GBA to Hong Kong and streamline the relevant arrangements.

The ""early and pilot implementation"" arrangement of the facilitation measure on the GBA Standard Contract for the banking, credit referencing and healthcare sectors has operated smoothly and received positive industry feedback. From November 2024, the facilitation measure on the GBA Standard Contract was regularised and extended to all sectors. As of end-August 2025, the Digital Policy Office has processed around 100 filing applications from different sectors, including healthcare, credit referencing, insurance, securities and printing sectors, etc. The proportion of filing applications by sectors is as follows:




Sector
Proportion


Healthcare
24%


Credit Referencing
16%


Insurance
14%


Securities
9%


Printing
9%


Information Technology
8%


Banking
7%


Others
12%




(2) With the acceleration of global digital transformation, data has become a key production factor, and a highly efficient data ecosystem is one of the key factors attracting enterprises to establish a foothold in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is underpinned by its distinctive advantages under ""one country, two systems"" and endowed with the characteristics of an international city. From supply and demand of data to application scenarios, Hong Kong is equipped with a robust foundation and possess an abundance of favourable conditions for promoting the development of data ecosystem.

The Financial Secretary announced in the 2024-25 Budget that an expert group, comprising professionals from sectors such as information technology, commerce and industry, finance and data sources, is commissioned to study how to develop a robust data trading ecosystem in Hong Kong. This includes Hong Kong's role as a ""super connector"" in data trading, the prerequisites, rules, and measures for promoting international data trading, as well as feasible implementation models. The study also covers key issues related to data trading, including data format standardisation, data pricing mechanisms, and data security protection, etc. The expert group is conducting a consultancy study on these topics and is expected to complete work and submit recommendations to the Government within 2025-26.

(3) Resolving legal issues and disputes that may arise from cross-boundary data flow (including through the voluntary adoption of the GBA Standard Contract) depends on the arrangements agreed upon by the parties to the contract and other applicable laws and regulations. Taking the GBA Standard Contract as an example, the contract template stipulates that any disputes arising between the parties to the contract shall be resolved through negotiation. If negotiation fails, the parties may choose to resolve the dispute through litigation or arbitration. If arbitration is opted, the dispute may be submitted to arbitral institutions including, inter alia, the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre, and the arbitral proceedings may be conducted in Hong Kong in accordance with the arbitration rules in force at the time. This provides a dispute resolution mechanism for cross-boundary data flow within the GBA.

In strengthening Hong Kong's advantages as an international arbitration centre, Hong Kong has been committed to promoting online dispute resolution (ODR) and deal-making services. According to information provided by the DoJ, the 2018 Policy Address proposed supporting the development of an online platform to provide efficient and cost-effective ODR services in Hong Kong. As a result, eBRAM International Online Dispute Resolution Centre (eBRAM Centre) was established. Since 2022, eBRAM Centre has launched online platforms, including the ""eBRAM APEC Online Dispute Resolution Platform"", ""Online Mediation Platform"" and ""Online Arbitration Platform"", providing efficient, cost-effective, and secure ODR services for parties from anywhere in the world. To facilitate cross-boundary commercial transactions and expand cross-boundary businesses, eBRAM Centre launched the ""Deal-Making Portal"" in December 2023. As of August 2025, more than 550 enterprises of various categories (including legal, professional and commercial services, information technology, etc. from Hong Kong, Mainland and other regions) have joined the ""Deal-Making Portal"".

Regarding the GBA, the DoJ first published the Action Plan on the Construction of Rule of Law in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in April 2024, actively supporting the establishment and promotion of a common ODR platform within the GBA. eBRAM Centre launched the thematic website of the GBA Online Collaborative Platform in July 2024, providing one-stop information on dispute resolution services within the GBA to integrate the arbitration and mediation resources of the GBA. A total of 14 memoranda of understanding with institutions have been signed so far for the Collaborative Platform.

The Government believes that Hong Kong, leveraging its strengths as an international legal and dispute resolution hub, particularly its professional expertise and institutional foundation in arbitration and mediation, can continue to enhance its dispute resolution mechanisms. This will help build a more robust ecosystem for resolving cross-boundary commercial disputes, including those arising from cross-boundary data flow. The Government will continue to monitor relevant developments, conduct study as and when appropriate, maintain communication with stakeholders in the legal and dispute resolution sectors. The Government will also strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the Mainland legal community to promote regional experience sharing as and when appropriate."
Speech by Secretary for Health at Opening Ceremony of BIOHK2025 (English only),2025-09-10 11:50,2025-09-10 12:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000295.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, at the Opening Ceremony of BIOHK2025 today (September 10):

Mr C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Professor Sun Dong (Secretary for Innovation, Technology and Industry), Professor Albert Yu (Chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization (HKBIO) and President of BIOHK2025), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  It is a pleasure to join you all again at BIOHK2025. On behalf of the Health Bureau of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government, I would like to welcome all delegates to the BIOHK2025 and thank the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization for creating this exceptional platform that brings together the brightest minds in biotechnology from East and West.

  Last year at this very convention, I shared with you our resolute mission: to transform Hong Kong into an international health and medical innovation hub. Today, I am delighted to give you a quick update on the significant strides we have made, turning that vision into tangible action and reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" in the global biotech landscape.

  Our commitment is unwavering. Hong Kong's unique position in biotech is reinforced by national policies, including the 14th Five-Year Plan, which designates Hong Kong as an international innovation and technology hub. We are pressing ahead with the reform of the regulatory framework for drugs and medical devices to facilitate the translation and application of biomedical innovations.

  To this end, we have achieved several key milestones:

  First, we implemented the ""1+"" mechanism in November 2023, which has been extended to all new drugs last year. Since implementation, 14 new drugs have been approved. Five of them have been listed in the Hospital Authority Drug Formulary.

  Second, to enhance the efficiency in processing relevant applications, a consultation service for new drug applications under the ""1+"" mechanism was launched in March this year.

  Third, in June this year, we announced the roadmap and timetable for implementing ""primary evaluation"" for new drug registration by phases beginning next year and establishing the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation by the end of next year.

  Fourth, the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trial Institute (GBAICTI), which we launched in Hetao last November, is now fully operational. The simultaneous launch of the GBAICTI and the Greater Bay Area International Clinical Trials Center in Shenzhen marked the beginning of a new chapter in cross-boundary collaboration under the ""one zone, two parks"" model. The GBAICTI is already actively advancing clinical trial projects and, to complement this, the Government is seeking to establish the Real-World Study and Application Centre by the end of this year to accelerate the research and development, approval and market launch of innovative medical products.

  Ladies and gentlemen, these initiatives are creating a vibrant and supportive ecosystem for the entire biotechnology industry. Last year, I encouraged you to participate actively in Hong Kong's health and medical innovation landscape. Today, that invitation is stronger than ever. Whether you are seeking to conduct cutting-edge clinical trials, navigate new regulatory pathways, or enter the vast Greater Bay Area market, Hong Kong is your perfect choice.

  On that note, I wish you all a fruitful and inspiring convention. Thank you."

LCQ16: Prevention of traffic accidents on expressways,2025-09-10 11:25,2025-09-10 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000189.htm,"  Following is a question by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming and a written reply by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

  There are views that expressways such as Tuen Mun Road, Tolo Highway and San Tin Highway are traffic black spots in Hong Kong, on which light goods vehicles use the right most lane from time to time, affecting traffic flow capacity and obstructing the view of drivers of following vehicles, thereby posing traffic safety hazards. In view of this, the Government may review the arrangements for the right to use the right most lane of an expressway, with a view to reducing traffic accidents. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) of the numbers of traffic accidents involving various types of vehicles on expressways and the related casualties in each of the past five years;

(2) as there are views that quite a number of traffic accidents are caused by overtaking, of the respective numbers of prosecutions instituted by the Police in each of the past five years against vehicles for prolonged occupation of the right most lane on an expressway, as well as for illegal use of such traffic lane;

(3) as the existing legislation provides that medium goods vehicles, heavy goods vehicles and buses are prohibited from using the right most lane of an expressway where the carriageway has three or more traffic lanes available unless they are heading for a right side exit, but such restriction does not apply to light goods vehicles, of the means by which the Government distinguishes the classes of vehicles on traffic lanes in the course of enforcement, for example, only by visual observation or by using other auxiliary methods; and

(4) to avoid traffic accidents on expressways caused by goods vehicles obstructing the view of drivers of following vehicles, whether the Government has plans to further prohibit goods vehicles from using the right most lane of expressways, for example, whether it will consider restricting goods vehicles exceeding a certain height from using such lane; if so, of the details; if not, the reasons for that?

Reply:

President,

  The Road Traffic (Expressway) Regulations (Cap. 374Q) currently govern the use of the right most lane and overtaking on expressways. The general principle is that drivers must keep to the left most lane on an expressway. If a driver needs to overtake a vehicle ahead of him, he must use the lane to the right and return to the left lane as soon as possible. In addition, large vehicles, including medium and heavy goods vehicles and buses, are prohibited from using the right most lane on an expressway with three or more lanes, unless the right most lane joins a diverging lane. After consulting the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and the Transport Department (TD), my response to the questions raised by the Hon Chan Yuet-ming concerning traffic accidents on expressways and the right most lane arrangements is as follows:

(1) The number of vehicles involved in traffic accident on expressways and the associated casualties by class of vehicles from 2020 to 2024 are at Annex. Overall speaking, the figures for 2020 to 2022 were relatively low, which may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in traffic accidents in 2023 and 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of minor accidents.

(2) The number of prosecutions relating to the prolonged occupation and unlawful use of the right most lane of expressway from 2020 to 2024 is set out below. The rise in the number of prosecutions for 2022 to 2024 was primarily attributable to the launch of the online traffic offence reporting platform Project PROVE in 2022, which resulted in a higher volume of reports received by the HKPF.

Note: Cap. 374Q regulation 11 stipulates the types of motor vehicles to which it applies, including medium and heavy goods vehicles, private and public buses, motor vehicles towing trailers or other vehicles, motor vehicles with expressway permits, recovery vehicles, and motor cycles, motor tricycles, private cars or light goods vehicles driven by drivers who are authorised to drive by probationary driving licences.

  The HKPF will continue to monitor traffic accident trends and review the effectiveness of enforcement actions which will be suitably adjusted to enhance road safety. At the same time, the HKPF will continue to encourage members of the public to report traffic-related contraventions through various available platforms.

(3) Currently, the Road Traffic (Construction and Maintenance of Vehicles) Regulations (Cap. 374A) stipulate the maximum overall dimensions for various categories of goods vehicles. During traffic enforcement on expressways, police officers would identify the category of goods vehicles based on its dimensions and characteristics such as vehicle model, number of axles, and rear markings. Prior to prosecution, officers would also verify the vehicle class by examining the vehicle licence or registration records to ensure accuracy.

(4) As mentioned in the preamble above, legislation currently restricts large vehicles (i.e. vehicles with an overall height exceeding 3.5 metres, including medium and heavy goods vehicles and buses) from using the right most lane of expressways. When considering restrictions on specific types of vehicles using particular expressway lanes, the Government would strike a balance between ensuring efficient use of expressways, maintaining smooth traffic flow, and safeguarding traffic safety. The Government will take into account the above factors to determine whether more stringent restrictions should be imposed on vehicles exceeding a certain height from using the right most lane of expressways.

  The TD's Road Users' Code also reminds drivers to look well ahead while driving, allowing for a wider field of vision to ensure safe lane changes and more time to react. Drivers should also maintain a sufficient distance from the vehicle ahead to ensure they can stop safely if the vehicle ahead suddenly slows down or stops, providing ample time to respond to emergencies or incidents. In addition, the TD has been collaborating with the Road Safety Council and the HKPF to conduct a range of publicity and educational activities to promote safety to all road users, including light goods vehicle drivers. Activities include publishing and distributing Road Safety Bulletins, displaying safety messages on variable message signs, and disseminating information through social media platforms, so that road users are well-informed of key safety points, which include driving rules on expressways and trunk roads (including keeping to the left lane, medium and heavy goods vehicles not using the right most lane on roads with three or more lanes)."
立法會十六題：預防快速公路的交通意外,2025-09-10 11:25,2025-09-10 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000187.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上陳月明議員的提問和運輸及物流局局長陳美寶的書面答覆：

問題：

有意見認為屯門公路、吐露港公路及新田公路等快速公路是本港的交通黑點；在該等公路上不時有輕型貨車使用最右行車線，影響交通流量和阻擋後車駕駛者視線，造成交通安全隱患，因此政府可檢討快速公路最右線使用權的安排以減少交通意外。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一）過去五年各類型車輛在快速公路上發生的交通意外數目及有關的傷亡情況為何；

（二）鑑於有意見認為不少交通意外是由於車輛超越前車引起，過去五年，每年警方針對在快速公路上長期佔用最右線，以及違例使用該行車線的車輛所作出的檢控數目分別為何；

（三）鑑於現時法例規定，快速公路的行車道如有三條或以上開放的行車線，中型貨車、重型貨車及巴士除駛往右面出口外，不可使用快速公路最右線，但有關限制並不適用於輕型貨車，政府在執法時有何方法分辨行車線上的車輛類別，例如是單靠目測分辨，抑或利用其他輔助方法；及

（四）為避免快速公路上的貨車因阻擋後車駕駛者視線而造成交通意外，政府有否計劃進一步禁止貨車使用快速公路的最右線，例如會否考慮限制超過一定高度的貨車使用該線；如有，詳情為何；如否，原因為何？

答覆：

主席：

現時《道路交通（快速公路）規例》（第374Q章）對駕駛者在快速公路上使用最右線及超越前方車輛已設有限制。一般而言，駕駛者在快速公路上必須在最左線行車。駕駛者如須越過其前面車輛，必須使用其右方行車線，並盡快駛回左線。另外，中、重型貨車、巴士等大型車輛在設有三條或以上行車線的快速公路上行駛時，不得在該快速公路的最右線駕駛，除非該最右線連結一條轉向行車線。就陳月明議員關於快速公路交通意外及最右線使用安排的提問，經諮詢香港警務處（警務處）及運輸署，我現回覆如下：

（一）二○二○年至二○二四年各類型車輛在快速公路上的涉及意外車輛數字及傷亡情況載於附件。總體而言，二○二○年至二○二二年的數字或受新冠疫情因素影響而較低，而二○二三年至二○二四年交通意外宗數有所上升，主要是由於輕微交通意外宗數增加。

（二）二○二○年至二○二四年涉及在快速公路上長期佔用最右線和違例使用最右線的檢控數字表列如下。二○二二年至二○二四年間檢控宗數有所上升，主要是由於「影住駕」交通舉報電子平台自二○二二年推出後警務處接獲的舉報個案有所增加。

註：第374Q章第11條列明適用的汽車種類，其中包括中型及重型貨車、私家及公共巴士、拖曳着拖車或另一車輛的汽車、獲發快速公路許可證的汽車、救援車輛及藉暫准駕駛執照獲授權駕駛的電單車、機動三輪車、私家車或輕型貨車的人所駕駛的車輛等。

警務處會持續檢視交通意外趨勢及執法成效，適時調整執法力度，以確保道路安全，亦會繼續鼓勵市民使用不同平台舉報相關交通違例事項。

（三）現時《道路交通（車輛構造及保養）規例》（第374A章）列明不同種類貨車的最大總尺寸。警務人員在快速公路上進行交通執法時，除了根據貨車尺寸，還可透過觀察其型號、車軸數目及車尾標記等特徵來識別其貨車種類。此外，警務人員在作出檢控前亦會檢查車輛牌照或車輛登記資料以作核實。

（四）如上文序言所述，法例現時已限制大型車輛（即全高度超過3.5米的車輛，包括中、重型貨車、巴士等）使用快速公路最右線。政府考慮限制某車種使用快速公路特定車道時，需要在確保快速公路的使用效率、保持交通暢順和保障交通安全之間作出適當平衡，並會按上述考慮留意是否需要進一步對超過一定高度的車輛使用快速公路最右線施加更嚴謹限制。

運輸署的《道路使用者守則》亦提醒駕駛者駕駛時應放遠視線，讓自己可以有較大的觀察範圍確保可以安全切線和有較充裕時間作出所需反應。駕駛者也應與前車保持足夠距離，確保在前車突然減速或停車時也能安全停下，當遇上突發事件或緊急事故時，也有足夠的應變時間。此外，運輸署一直聯同道路安全議會及警務處進行各種宣傳及教育活動，向所有道路使用者（包括輕型貨車駕駛者）推廣，例如出版和派發《道路安全通訊》、在可變信息顯示屏上顯示安全信息、透過社交媒體平台發放資訊等，讓道路使用者了解在道路安全應注意的事項，當中包括快速公路及主幹路的駕駛守則（包括靠左線行駛、中重型貨車在三條或以上行車線的路段不可使用最右線）等。"
立法會七題：推廣碳普惠,2025-09-10 11:05,2025-09-10 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000256.htm,"以下是今日（九月十日）在立法會會議上李浩然議員的提問和環境及生態局局長謝展寰的書面答覆︰

問題：

環境及生態局副局長在去年十一月二十日本會辯論「盡快啓動碳普惠市場的建設工作」的議員議案時提到，當局會參考不同省市的碳普惠發展及相關經驗，探討在香港擴大例如「綠綠賞」等計劃，加強鼓勵市民實踐綠色低碳生活。有意見認為現時「綠綠賞」計劃旨在鼓勵市民在日常生活中積極參與資源分類回收活動，該計劃有待發展為更全面、成熟且具系統性的碳普惠機制。就此，政府可否告知本會：

（一） 鑑於現時市民可通過參與回收活動賺取「綠綠賞」積分以兌換禮品，而當中不同種類的回收物按公斤或件數所對應的「綠綠賞」積分相近，當局基於哪些準則釐定回收物所對應的「綠綠賞」積分；

（二） 據悉目前有私營機構通過計算市民進行回收等環保行為的減碳量給予相應的獎賞，以更好地鼓勵市民減碳，當局會否考慮借鑑相關做法，以回收物的減碳量釐定「綠綠賞」積分，從而提升「綠綠賞」計劃的吸引力和效益；

（三） 會否研究參考內地推出流動應用程式記錄公眾的減碳行為，並擴大「綠綠賞」計劃的適用範圍，將涉及「衣、食、住、行」各類型的綠色低碳行為納入「綠綠賞」積分，以打造立體式的碳普惠生態圈；

（四） 會否考慮爭取更多商戶參與「綠綠賞」計劃，例如以「綠綠賞」積分換取購物券、與更多積分獎賞平台互通積分，以加強市民參與該計劃的誘因，並在鼓勵減碳的同時刺激本地零售消費；及

（五） 會否與粵港澳大灣區其他內地城市協同推出通用的碳普惠策略或機制？

答覆：

主席：

環境保護署（環保署）在二○二○年十一月推出「綠綠賞」電子積分計劃（「綠綠賞」），鼓勵更多市民將減廢回收的習慣融入日常生活。經過環保署多年的努力和得到市民的支持，「綠綠賞」已由一個積分計劃逐漸發展為一個凝聚不同社會界别共同推動建立綠色減廢回收文化的平台，成功推動市民參與廢物分類回收和培養回收習慣。

就李浩然議員的提問，現回覆如下：

（一）環保署在釐定各種回收物的「綠綠賞」積分獎賞時，主要考慮不同廢物的棄置量、回收率、市場回收價值，以提升整體回收量、減少棄置量，同時避免與市場上私營回收商造成直接競爭。例如，棄置量較高、回收率和市場回收價值均較低的廚餘、膠樽和玻璃樽，其積分會較多，用以鼓勵市民參與回收和養成回收習慣；而其他回收物則採用同一分數。

（二）及（三）政府其中一項主要的減碳策略是減少廢物棄置在堆填區，因此現時市民提交較高棄置量的回收物（如廚餘、膠樽和玻璃樽）可獲得較多「綠綠賞」積分，其基本理念與推動減碳的理念相符。環保署在二○二四年二月起與港鐵旗下的減碳獎賞平台Carbon Wallet合作推出試驗計劃，「綠綠賞」手機應用程式用戶可將「綠綠賞」積分兌換為Carbon Wallet積分，換取各種與低碳生活相關的獎賞，例如免費港鐵單程車票和本地生態遊等。市民也可以透過Carbon Wallet就記錄步行、乘搭港鐵旅程、素食等減碳行為賺取積分。Carbon Wallet和「綠綠賞」的合作可鼓勵市民同時參與回收和減碳行為，帶來顯著的協同效應。我們也留意到為推動公眾綠色低碳生活方式，內地有省市推出應用程式，記錄公眾的低碳生活，如低碳出行、節能節水、家庭光伏安裝使用等，並將其轉化為碳幣。碳幣可兌換禮品，包括商店消費券及網約車優惠券等，其作用主要是推廣綠色低碳生活。為鼓勵更多市民實踐低碳生活，環保署會持續探討與更多減碳相關的獎賞平台合作，更高效地運用公共資源，提升「綠綠賞」的覆蓋率和吸引力。

（四）環保署在二○二四年十二月起與「易賞錢」開展合作，市民可將「綠綠賞」積分兌換成「易賞錢」積分，並在全港超過500間超級市場和零售商店自由換取所需的禮品。此項目推出後，市民反應熱烈。為進一步優化「綠綠賞」，環保署計劃在二○二六年四月全面實現「綠綠賞」禮品兌換電子化，連接更多市場上的獎賞平台，以提供更便捷和多元化的禮品選擇，鼓勵更多市民積極參與回收行動。我們期望通過引入更多與超級市場和零售商店有聯繫的獎賞平台參與積分兌換，不但進一步提升市民參與減碳和回收的積極性，更有助刺激本地零售消費活動。

（五）在探討與內地區域性合作方面，我們將繼續通過粵港環保及應對氣候變化合作小組，與粵方就推行碳普惠保持交流，借鑑不同省市在碳普惠機制方面的先進經驗，探討合作空間和機會，加強鼓勵市民實踐綠色低碳生活。"
LCQ7: Promoting carbon inclusive initiatives,2025-09-10 11:05,2025-09-10 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/10/P2025091000260.htm,"Following is a question by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee and a written reply by the Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, in the Legislative Council today (September 10):

Question:

During the debate on the Member's motion on ""Expeditiously kick-starting the construction of a carbon inclusive market"" in this Council on November 20 last year, the Under Secretary for Environment and Ecology stated that the Administration would draw reference from the development and experiences of carbon inclusive initiatives in different provinces and municipalities to explore the possibility of expanding schemes such as the GREEN$ scheme in Hong Kong, with a view to further encouraging members of the public to practise a green and low-carbon lifestyle. There are views that the current GREEN$ scheme, which aims to encourage public participation in resource separation and recycling activities in daily life, has yet to be developed into a more comprehensive, mature and systematic carbon inclusive mechanism. In this connection, will the Government inform this Council:

(1) given that members of the public can currently earn GREEN$ Points by participating in recycling activities for redeeming gifts, and that different types of recyclables yield similar number of GREEN$ Points per kilogram or per piece, of the criteria the authorities have adopted to determine the number of GREEN$ Points for various types of recyclables;

(2) as it is learnt that some private organisations currently reward members of the public for their pro-environmental behaviour, such as recycling, by calculating the corresponding carbon reduction, so as to better incentivise the public, whether the authorities will consider drawing on such a practice to base GREEN$ Points on the carbon reduction of recyclables, thereby enhancing the appeal and effectiveness of the GREEN$ scheme;

(3) whether it will consider making reference to the Mainland mobile applications that record public carbon reduction behaviours, and expanding the scope of the GREEN$ scheme to incorporate various green and low-carbon behaviours across the categories of ""clothing, food, accommodation and transport"" into GREEN$ Points, so as to create a multi-dimensional carbon inclusive ecosystem;

(4) whether it will consider encouraging more businesses to participate in the GREEN$ scheme, such as by allowing GREEN$ Points to be used for redeeming shopping vouchers or enabling point interoperability with more reward platforms, so as to strengthen incentives for public participation in the scheme and stimulate local retail consumption while encouraging carbon reduction; and

(5) whether it will collaborate with other Mainland cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to introduce a common carbon inclusive strategy or mechanism?

Reply:

President,

The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) launched the GREEN$ Electronic Participation Incentive Scheme (GREEN$ ePIS) in November 2020 to encourage more members of the public to integrate waste reduction and recycling habits into their daily lives. Through years of dedicated efforts by the EPD and support from the public, the GREEN$ ePIS has gradually evolved from an incentive scheme into a platform that facilitates collaborative efforts from various sectors of society to promote green waste reduction and recycling culture. It has successfully motivated public participation in waste separation and recycling, as well as cultivating recycling habits.

The reply to the question raised by Dr the Hon Hoey Simon Lee is as follows:

(1) When determining the GREEN$ rewards for various types of recyclables, the EPD primarily considers the disposal quantity, recycling rate, and market value of different wastes. This approach aims to increase overall recycling quantity, reduce disposal quantity, and avoid direct competition with private recyclers in the market. For instance, food waste, plastic bottles and glass bottles, which have high disposal quantity but low recycling rates and market values, will earn more points to encourage public participation in recycling and fostering recycling habits, while other recyclables will use a standard point system.

(2) & (3) One of the Government's key carbon reduction strategies is to minimise waste disposal in landfills. Therefore, members of the public who submit recyclables with higher disposal quantity (such as food waste, plastic bottles and glass bottles) can earn more GREEN$ points, which aligns with the principle of promoting carbon reduction. Since February 2024, the EPD has partnered with Carbon Wallet, a carbon reduction reward platform under the MTR Corporation, to launch a pilot scheme. Users of GREEN$ mobile app can convert their GREEN$ points into Carbon Wallet points for redemption of various rewards related to low-carbon living, such as free MTR single journey tickets and local eco-tours. Members of the public can also earn points through Carbon Wallet for carbon reduction activities such as walking, taking MTR journeys, and adopting vegetarian diet. The collaboration between Carbon Wallet and GREEN$ ePIS encourages the public to take part in both recycling and carbon reduction activities, achieving significant synergy effects. We have also observed that, to promote a green and low-carbon lifestyle among the public, some provinces and municipalities in the Mainland have implemented carbon inclusive initiatives. For instance, they have launched apps to track public daily low-carbon activities, such as low-carbon commuting, energy and water conservation, and residential photovoltaic installations, to convert these actions into carbon coins. These carbon coins can be redeemed for gifts, including shop consumption vouchers and online ride-hailing coupons, with the purpose of promoting a green and low-carbon lifestyle. To encourage greater public participation in practising low-carbon living, the EPD will continue to explore collaborations with more carbon reduction reward platforms to utilise public resources more efficiently and enhance the coverage and appeal of GREEN$ ePIS.

(4)The EPD has collaborated with ""MoneyBack"" since December 2024, enabling members of the public to convert their GREEN$ points into ""MoneyBack"" points, which can be freely redeemed for the required rewards at over 500 supermarkets and retail stores across the territory. The response to this initiative has been enthusiastic. To further enhance the GREEN$ ePIS, the EPD plans to fully digitalise the GREEN$ gift redemption by April 2026, connecting with more reward platforms in the market to offer more convenient and diverse gift options, thereby encouraging greater public participation in recycling activities. We hope that, through introducing more reward platforms linked to supermarkets and retail stores for points redemption, we can not only boost public participation in carbon reduction and recycling, but also help stimulate local retail consumption.

(5) In terms of exploring regional co-operation with the Mainland, we will continue to maintain exchanges with Guangdong on carbon inclusivity implementation through the Hong Kong-Guangdong Joint Working Group on Environmental Protection and Combating Climate Change. We will also draw reference from the experiences in developing carbon inclusivity mechanisms in different provinces and municipalities, and explore potential areas and opportunities for collaboration to further encourage citizens to adopt a green and low-carbon lifestyle."

Honourable Vice-Chairman C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Professor Albert Yu (Chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization (HKBIO) and President of BIOHK2025), Professor CM Lo (Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau), Professor Herman Hu (Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Professor Hu Shao-ming), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is a true pleasure to see you all again at BIOHK2025. Time flies. This marks the fourth edition of this annual flagship biotechnology convention in Hong Kong. Following the success of past years, I am delighted to witness the continued growth of this event in its scale, diversity and global significance, mirroring the dynamism of Hong Kong's ever-growing innovation and technology (I&T) ecosystem.

  Let me begin with some exciting updates of Hong Kong's I&T developments. With strong support from our motherland, the Plaque Presentation Ceremony for 15 State Key Laboratories (SKLs) in Hong Kong was held last month, recognising our city's world-class capabilities and outstanding achievements in scientific research. Among all, six of the SKLs focus on life and health technologies, covering various aspects such as digestive disease, emerging infectious diseases, and pharmaceutical biotechnology. These SKLs serve as engines of discovery and magnets for talent, translating R&D (research and development) into real-world applications that benefit society.

  Another milestone worth celebrating is the recent announcement by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou cluster ranks first globally in its Global Innovation Index (GII) 2025. This is truly a remarkable achievement. The top ranking is not only a recognition of the strong innovative capacity of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), but also a powerful endorsement of the GBA as a fertile ground for I&T investment and entrepreneurship, including biotechnology and other frontier technologies.

  For the first time, WIPO has included venture capital investment as a new metric in its GII ranking, highlighting the importance of transforming scientific research into economic value. It also reflects a broader global trend and standard: innovation must be scalable, sustainable and investable. It also affirms that Hong Kong's efforts in fostering effective collaboration among the Government, industry, academic, research and investment sectors are on the right track.

  As you may be aware, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has identified life and health technology as a strategic industry, and we are committed to develop Hong Kong into a global leader in this field. Every step requires strategic investment and long-term vision, and Hong Kong is rising to seize these opportunities. I am confident that our world-class R&D infrastructure such as the InnoHK research clusters and the future Life and Health Technology Research Institute, coupled with proactive funding schemes like the Research, Academic and Industry Sectors One-plus Scheme and the upcoming Innovation and Technology Industry-Oriented Fund, will empower Hong Kong to navigate its I&T journey with strength and resilience.

  Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is open for innovation. As we gather here at BIOHK2025, we reaffirm our shared commitment to shaping the future of biotechnology. The opportunities ahead are vast, and the momentum is real. Let us seize the moment together for a healthier and smarter future, starting right here in Hong Kong.

  In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the HKBIO and the relevant stakeholders, including our industry leaders and experts, for their continued efforts and significant contributions to promote the development of biotechnology in Hong Kong. May I wish the BIOHK2025 a resounding success. Thank you."

I'd say that's proof collaboration works. And that this annual Summit delivers.

 Since 2016, Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit has united governments, businesses, peoples and cultures in collaboration for change. For rewarding opportunities.

 Over the past 10 years, more than 45 000 people from over 120 countries and regions have participated in the Summit. Together, they have presented over 2 800 projects along the Belt and Road, shaping a shared vision through collaboration and connectivity, which are the fundamental values of the Belt and Road Initiative.

 Upholding that spirit, this year's Summit theme is ""Collaborate for Change – Shape a Shared Future"".

 To mark this 10th edition, we are introducing a new session on signature Belt and Road projects. It will be complemented by project investment sessions on energy, natural resources, public utilities and urban development, including Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis, which takes up one-third of Hong Kong's geographical area and is fast rising as an innovation and technology hub.

 Later this morning, we will witness the exchange of 9 MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding) and co-operation agreements, between Hong Kong and Belt and Road countries, on official co-operation in dispute avoidance and resolution, customs, anti-corruption, meteorology, investment promotion, and more. These underline our commitment to the Belt and Road, to enabling co-operation and exchanges for mutual benefit. Also today, some 36 business-to-business agreements and deals will be announced, covering finance, technology, logistics, professional services and education.

 Thanks to projects and deals closed in recent days, their total value is now close to 1 billion US Dollars. And that's just the beginning. The beginning of another decade of business, of investment, and of co-operation.

Trade and investment

 Here in Hong Kong, when we talk business, we mean business. Hong Kong has long thrived as a free port dedicated to multilateralism.

 The HKSAR Government is rapidly expanding Hong Kong's global trade networks. We have signed free trade agreements with 14 Belt and Road countries, and investment agreements with about 20 Belt and Road economies, as well as Comprehensive Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions.

 Not surprisingly, our external trade with Belt and Road countries exceeded 276 billion US Dollars last year, up about 80 per cent since 2013, and three times the average growth rate of Hong Kong's overall merchandise trade over the same period. Some 1 400 companies from Belt and Road countries have established a base in Hong Kong to seize these opportunities.

 It helps that Hong Kong is one of the most prolific sources of foreign direct investment in the Belt and Road. In 2023, our outward direct investment in Belt and Road countries and regions was 133 billion US Dollars.

 That's 3.6 times of the amount in 2013 and four times that of Hong Kong's overall outward direct investment growth, a clear sign that global capital converges here and deploys globally.

 We invest as well as connect. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority established the Belt and Road HK Flagship Impact Fund with the Silk Road Fund Company, and initial capital totalling 1 billion US Dollars.

 Last year, our Monetary Authority signed a MoU with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund on a joint 1 billion-US Dollar fund. They will invest in companies with a Hong Kong nexus expanding to Saudi Arabia.

 Last week, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan issued a 2 billion Renminbi dim sum bond in Hong Kong, the first Renminbi bond issued by a government-owned entity from Central Asia.

 That underscores Hong Kong's position as a leading fund-raising hub for Belt and Road economies. That's why more than 100 Belt and Road companies are listed on the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited), with more to come.

 And I believe it is important to reach out to our Belt and Road partners, in person, to let them know what Hong Kong can do for them – for you – whether in key events like this one, or in visiting their countries.

 Since assuming office three years ago, I have visited 12 Belt and Road countries. To most of them, I have led high-level business delegations from Hong Kong, witnessing some 160 MoUs, co-operation agreements and deliverables with the respective economies – many now in development.

 Just this May, I led a joint delegation of Mainland and Hong Kong companies to explore the markets of Qatar and Kuwait, my second visit to the Middle East region.

 Alongside numerous agreements reached during the trip, I'm pleased to note that one of the participants has chosen Hong Kong as its global hub and listed on the HKEX just last month.

 I also witnessed a MoU, less than two weeks ago, between Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Investment and our Belt and Road Office, part of its new signature project collaborations, working directly with governments.

 Major Belt and Road projects and events are turning to Hong Kong for global roadshows. They include the Future Investment Initiative PRIORITY Summit, in 2023, the recent Saudi Super Cup, and LEAP – one of the Middle East's largest tech expos, which chose Hong Kong for its first global edition, LEAP East, to be held next year.

 To support development in the Global South, we continue to expand our world-wide network of trade offices across partner countries.

 Our Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices, Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council work together to connect businesses and projects via Hong Kong.

 Through these networks, our Government ties now extend to some 130 countries, including about 100 Belt and Road countries.

Competitiveness

 To a world of investors, especially our friends from Belt and Road economies, Hong Kong offers a unique blend of professionalism and efficiency.

 Hong Kong has long shone as a resourceful and resilient economy, one of the world's most competitive in the many sectors and industries we commit to.

 That was once again borne out just three months ago, when the International Institute for Management Development put out its 2025 World Competitiveness Yearbook. Hong Kong placed third, globally, up two places from last year.

 In ""government efficiency"" and ""business efficiency"", Hong Kong rose to second overall. And we topped the rankings in ""tax policy"" and ""business legislation"".

 Competitiveness is in Hong Kong's DNA. And central to that competitiveness, is our people, and our ability in nurturing them.

Talent

 In the IMD (International Institute for Management Development)'s annual World Talent Ranking, which came out just yesterday, Hong Kong rose to fourth, globally, up from ninth place last year and 16th place the year before. Moving up 12 places in two years, we have come to our highest-ever standing in the report, ranking number one in Asia.

 Overall, Hong Kong topped the ranking in the percentage of ""graduates in sciences"", and placed among the global top five in the availability of ""finance skills"", the ""remuneration of management"", and the effectiveness of ""management education"".

 Hong Kong's performance, the IMD report said, demonstrates that ""targeted reforms and investment can result in significant gains in talent competitiveness over time"", noting that Hong Kong attracts large numbers of inbound students from abroad, through our outstanding academic achievement. Indeed, Hong Kong is home to five of the world's top 100 universities, which cultivate multi-talented and enterprising young people for our dynamic city.

 And Hong Kong is committed to nurturing future generations from home and abroad. With the HKSAR Government's Belt and Road Scholarship and other programmes, more than 4 000 students from Belt and Road countries are enrolled in our tertiary programmes every year.

 This summer, some 400 students from Belt and Road countries were placed in summer internships here, strengthening our shared Belt and Road talent pool.

 Our targeted reforms on talent cover not only grooming our own, but also attracting a world of professionals to our world city. Since the end of 2022, our enhanced talent admission schemes have received more than 520 000 applications, with over 350 000 approved. More than 230 000 have arrived in Hong Kong over the period, boosting our talent pool and economic growth.

Connectivity

 And of course, Hong Kong also opens its doors wide to travellers who come to our city for business, leisure and more. Last year, Hong Kong welcomed more than 44 million visitors, fourth globally for visitor arrivals by city, winning the world’s best airport immigration service award. Our international airport is the world's busiest air cargo hub, handling 4.9 million tonnes of goods and about 45 per cent of Hong Kong's external trade last year.

 With the three-runway system now in operation, we expect up to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually in about 10 years' time, with the enhanced capacity to support social and economic growth across Belt and Road countries.

 We have signed 80 bilateral civil aviation agreements and operate flights to some 60 Belt and Road destinations, strengthening our role along the Air Silk Road.

Green and sustainable innovation

 Hong Kong is committed to growth. We are also dedicated to sustainability, to ensuring a healthy development for all. As a green and sustainable innovation and finance hub, Hong Kong is working with Belt and Road partners to build a Green and Innovative Silk Road.

 We provide internationally recognised green building certification, with the flexibility to help countries adapt standards and access green finance. And, for seven consecutive years, Hong Kong has ranked first in Asia in the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged.

Systems

 Hong Kong's success as a premier functional platform for the Belt and Road rests on our unique ""one country, two systems"" framework.

 It allows Hong Kong to maintain a common law jurisdiction with a sophisticated legal sector, and a judiciary that exercises its powers independently, providing the safeguards that investors and projects demand.

 In May, government representatives of over 30 states, many of them from the Belt and Road, gathered in Hong Kong to sign the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation.

 The Organization will be headquartered here, in Hong Kong, as the world's first intergovernmental legal body dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation.

 The ""one country, two systems"" principle ensures that Hong Kong thrives as an east-meets-west centre for international cultural exchange. With programmes like the Asia+ Festival, which begins next week, we present myriad events showcasing the richness of Asia and Belt and Road regions.

 And the Hong Kong Palace Museum, which houses treasures from Beijing's Forbidden City, is now hosting masterpieces from Qatar's Museum of Islamic Art, Doha. In two months' time, it will also showcase extraordinary collections from seven prominent museums in Egypt. That's just a taste of the cultural exchange, the creative dialogue, that Hong Kong delivers!

The Ideal Belt and Road Hub

 Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is the ideal Belt and Road hub. As the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage, Hong Kong stands as the premier gateway for co-operation, bridging people, trade, business, education, culture and values across the region, connecting Asia and the world. We are a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" for high-quality collaborations worldwide.

 Our ""dual superpower"" of connecting and value-adding means Hong Kong is more than a link between capital and projects. We also inject vigour, innovation and sustainability, adding strategic value to everything we do.

 Hong Kong will continue to drive high-quality development along the Belt and Road. That's our promise towards a brighter future. Together with you.

 My thanks to our Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Belt and Road Office and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for making this Summit such a flagship international event over the past decade. And, I'm confident, for many decades to come.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a rewarding Summit, and a memorable stay in Hong Kong.

 Thank you."

 Good morning. Welcome to Hong Kong, and the 10th Belt and Road Summit.

 Let me first extend a warm welcome to – His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol of Cambodia (Deputy Prime Minister and First Vice-Chairman of the Council for the Development of Cambodia), His Excellency Minister Santiphab Phomvihane from Laos (Minister of Finance of Laos), His Excellency Minister Anthony Loke from Malaysia (Minister of Transport of Malaysia), His Excellency Dr Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Sayed from Qatar (Minister of State for Foreign Trade Affairs of Qatar), as well as many senior officials and distinguished leaders from Belt and Road countries here, for this anniversary Summit.

 As the Chinese saying goes, ""ææèªéæ¹ä¾ï¼ä¸äº¦æ¨ä¹"" – ""What a joy to have friends coming from afar"".

 So many friends, I'm delighted to say. This 10th anniversary edition of Hong Kong's Belt and Road Summit brings together more than 6 000 high-profile leaders and participants from governments, international organisations, companies and the global media, here to celebrate a decade of achievements.

Since the end of 2022, our enhanced talent admission schemes have received more than 520 000 applications, with over 350 000 approved. More than 230 000 have arrived in Hong Kong over the period, boosting our talent pool and economic growth.

Connectivity

 And of course, Hong Kong also opens its doors wide to travellers who come to our city for business, leisure and more. Last year, Hong Kong welcomed more than 44 million visitors, fourth globally for visitor arrivals by city, winning the world’s best airport immigration service award. Our international airport is the world's busiest air cargo hub, handling 4.9 million tonnes of goods and about 45 per cent of Hong Kong's external trade last year.

 With the three-runway system now in operation, we expect up to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually in about 10 years' time, with the enhanced capacity to support social and economic growth across Belt and Road countries.

 We have signed 80 bilateral civil aviation agreements and operate flights to some 60 Belt and Road destinations, strengthening our role along the Air Silk Road.

Green and sustainable innovation

 Hong Kong is committed to growth. We are also dedicated to sustainability, to ensuring a healthy development for all. As a green and sustainable innovation and finance hub, Hong Kong is working with Belt and Road partners to build a Green and Innovative Silk Road.

 We provide internationally recognised green building certification, with the flexibility to help countries adapt standards and access green finance. And, for seven consecutive years, Hong Kong has ranked first in Asia in the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged.

Systems

 Hong Kong's success as a premier functional platform for the Belt and Road rests on our unique ""one country, two systems"" framework.

 It allows Hong Kong to maintain a common law jurisdiction with a sophisticated legal sector, and a judiciary that exercises its powers independently, providing the safeguards that investors and projects demand.

 In May, government representatives of over 30 states, many of them from the Belt and Road, gathered in Hong Kong to sign the Convention on the Establishment of the International Organization for Mediation.

 The Organization will be headquartered here, in Hong Kong, as the world's first intergovernmental legal body dedicated to resolving international disputes through mediation.

 The ""one country, two systems"" principle ensures that Hong Kong thrives as an east-meets-west centre for international cultural exchange. With programmes like the Asia+ Festival, which begins next week, we present myriad events showcasing the richness of Asia and Belt and Road regions.

 And the Hong Kong Palace Museum, which houses treasures from Beijing's Forbidden City, is now hosting masterpieces from Qatar's Museum of Islamic Art, Doha. In two months' time, it will also showcase extraordinary collections from seven prominent museums in Egypt. That's just a taste of the cultural exchange, the creative dialogue, that Hong Kong delivers!

The Ideal Belt and Road Hub

 Yes, ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is the ideal Belt and Road hub. As the only world city that converges both the China advantage and the global advantage, Hong Kong stands as the premier gateway for co-operation, bridging people, trade, business, education, culture and values across the region, connecting Asia and the world. We are a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"" for high-quality collaborations worldwide.

 Our ""dual superpower"" of connecting and value-adding means Hong Kong is more than a link between capital and projects. We also inject vigour, innovation and sustainability, adding strategic value to everything we do.

 Hong Kong will continue to drive high-quality development along the Belt and Road. That's our promise towards a brighter future. Together with you.

 My thanks to our Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, the Belt and Road Office and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council for making this Summit such a flagship international event over the past decade. And, I'm confident, for many decades to come.

 Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you all a rewarding Summit, and a memorable stay in Hong Kong.

 Thank you."

HKSAR Government strongly disapproves of and rejects annual report of European Commission,2025-09-09 23:13,2025-09-09 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900890.htm,"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) today (September 9) strongly disapproved of and rejected the unfounded and biased content targeting the HKSAR's safeguarding of national security, human rights, etc, in the so-called annual report on Hong Kong issued by the European Commission and the High Representative of the European Union(EU)for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government stressed, ""The HKSAR is an inalienable part of the People's Republic of China. It is a local administrative region that enjoys a high degree of autonomy under 'one country, two systems' and comes directly under the Central People's Government. The legal basis for implementing 'one country, two systems' comprises the Constitution and the Basic Law, which provide constitutional guarantee for fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality before the law, and is buttressed by the rule of law and independent judicial power.

""The HKSAR Government will resolutely, fully and faithfully implement the Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) so as to address, combat, deter and prevent in accordance with the law acts and activities endangering national security. At the same time, it will safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people in accordance with the law. Its overarching goal is to ensure the steadfast and successful implementation of 'one country, two systems'. The HKSAR Government strongly urges the EU to respect facts, abide by the international law and basic norms governing international relations that it claims to uphold, and immediately stop its long-arm jurisdiction and interference in Hong Kong matters, which are purely China's internal affairs.""

Safeguarding Due Administration of Justice and Rule of Law

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""The HKSAR Government safeguards independent judicial power and fully supports the Judiciary in exercising its judicial power independently, safeguarding the due administration of justice and the rule of law. Establishing the mechanism for safeguarding national security in the HKSAR will not undermine the independent judicial power. Our judicial system continues to be protected by the Basic Law. When adjudicating cases concerning offence endangering national security, as in any other cases, judges remain independent and impartial in performing their judicial duties, free from any interference. The implementation of the HKNSL over the past five years has proven that the courts have handled all the cases involving the HKNSL strictly in accordance with the above principles.

""As a matter of fact, the principle of judicial deference to the executive's assessment on national security is well established in common law jurisdictions. The Court of Appeal in an important judgment decided in May 2024 that there are at least three areas where the court would make judgment while giving the executive deference on assessment on national security: first, where a fundamental right of the person affected by the measure is engaged; second, where the requirement of a fair trial is in issue; and third, where the question of open justice is raised.

The spokesman stressed, ""The rule of law in Hong Kong is strong and robust, and withstands the test of time. There is no truth in saying that there is any decline in the rule of law in Hong Kong, or that Hong Kong is becoming a 'totalitarian' city. Hong Kong's common law system has been built and maintained over the years by the joint efforts of the Judiciary and legal professions, including judges at all levels of courts, and it will not be changed because of the departure of individual overseas non-permanent judges. Despite some departures, two overseas non-permanent judges were appointed last year and this year.

""The Judiciary exercises judicial power independently in accordance with the law, and everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to a fair hearing. The courts decide cases strictly in accordance with the evidence and all applicable laws. Cases will never be handled any differently owing to the profession, political beliefs or background of the persons involved. The prosecution has the burden to prove beyond reasonable doubt the commission of an offence before a defendant may be convicted by the court.""

Safeguarding Rights and Freedoms

The HKSAR Government spokesman said, ""The HKSAR Government steadfastly safeguards the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people as protected under the law. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, human rights in the city have always been robustly guaranteed constitutionally by both the Constitution and the Basic Law. At the same time, HKSAR's laws to safeguard national security attach special importance to human rights. Article 4 of the HKNSL and the section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security in the HKSAR, and that the rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of speech, of the press, of publication, of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration, that Hong Kong residents enjoy under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong, shall be protected in accordance with the law. Nonetheless, just as the case with other places in the world, such rights and freedoms are not absolute. The ICCPR also expressly states that some of them may be subject to restrictions as prescribed by law that are necessary for the protection of national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others, etc.

""Since the implementation of the HKNSL and the SNSO, the media landscape in Hong Kong has remained vibrant. However, some people with ulterior motives deliberately fabricated facts about freedom of the press and speech in Hong Kong. Like all other places in the world, freedom of the press and speech are not absolute. The media, like everyone else, has an obligation to abide by all the laws. The media continue to enjoy the freedom to comment on and criticise government policies without any restriction, as long as this is not in violation of the law. The court further cited precedents from the European Court of Human Rights regarding press freedom in the reasons for verdict of a relevant case, pointing out that the European Convention on Human Rights does not guarantee a wholly unrestricted freedom of speech even with respect to press coverage on matters of serious public concern. The most crucial point is that journalists must act in good faith and on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism' in order to enjoy the protection of their rights to freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Laws safeguarding national security

A spokesman for the HKSAR Government said, ""In accordance with international law and international relations based on the Charter of the United Nations, it is each and every sovereign state's inherent right to enact laws safeguarding national security, and it is also an international practice. The EU exposed their double standards as they pointed fingers at Hong Kong's legal system and enforcement mechanisms to safeguard national security, while totally disregarding the constitutional duty and practical needs of the city to legislate, and the positive effects brought by the enactment of the national security legislation on economic development and the protection of human rights.

""In 2020, the Central Authorities decisively enacted the HKNSL and the HKSAR Government soon afterwards promulgated it for implementation. The HKNSL has addressed the shortcomings and plugged the loopholes in the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security of the HKSAR. Its effect in stopping violence and curbing disorder was immediate, and has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence'. The implementation of HKNSL was a 'watershed moment' in Hong Kong's transition from chaos to order, as stability and safety of the city have been restored by the law. In 2024, the HKSAR fulfilled its constitutional duty by enacting the SNSO, thereby improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security. As a matter of fact, during the public consultation of the Basic Law Article 23 legislation, 98.6 per cent of the submissions of opinions showed support and gave positive comments, reflecting a strong consensus in society for the legislation, and it is also the aspiration of the people.

""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that 'laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable'. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the SNSO clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. The HKSAR law enforcement agencies have been taking law enforcement actions based on evidence and strictly in accordance with the law in respect of the acts of the persons or entities concerned, which have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation.

""As the legal proceedings concerning cases involving Lai Chee-ying, '35+' conspiracy to commit subversion and the Hong Kong Alliance are still ongoing, it is inappropriate for any person to comment on the details of the cases. The HKSAR Government must emphasise that all cases are handled strictly on the basis of evidence and in accordance with the law. The Department of Justice takes charge of criminal prosecutions, free from any interference by virtue of Article 63 of the Basic Law. All prosecutorial decisions are based on an objective analysis of all admissible evidence and applicable laws. All cases concerning offence endangering national security will be handled by the prosecution and judicial authorities of the HKSAR in a fair and timely manner in strict compliance with Article 42(1) of the HKNSL, with the procedural rights of defendants exercised in accordance with the law fully respected throughout the process. The situation of so-called 'delays in trials' does not exist at all.

""Extraterritorial effect for the offences under HKNSL and SNSO fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. It is both necessary and legitimate, and is also in line with those of other countries and regions around the world. It can be seen that the national security laws of various countries, including the member states of the EU, also have extraterritorial effect under the 'personality principle' and the 'protective principle'.

""As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Police are duty bound to pursue the liability of those who have allegedly endangered national security overseas. Those absconders are hiding overseas are wanted because they continue to blatantly engage in activities endangering national security, including inciting secession and requesting foreign countries to impose 'sanctions' or blockade and engage in other hostile activities against the People's Republic of China and the HKSAR. More so, they continue to collude with external forces to be covered for their evil deeds. Their malicious acts to endanger national security have been seen through by all, and there is no doubt that they have clearly and seriously endangered national security. As the law enforcement department of the HKSAR safeguarding national security, the Police are duty bound to put the persons concerned on the wanted list in accordance with the law and it is necessary to take all lawful measures, including the measures specified under section 89 of the SNSO, to strongly combat the acts of abscondment. The action is fully justified, necessary and legitimate. The extraterritorial effect for the laws safeguarding national security fully aligns with the principles of international law, international practice and common practice adopted in various countries and regions. Quite a number of countries would also impose similar measures on wanted criminals, including cancellation of passports.

""The Correctional Services Department (CSD) attaches great importance to the safety and health of persons-in-custody (PICs). Regardless of the identities, ages and nationalities of PICs, the CSD is committed to ensuring that the custodial environment is secure, safe, humane, appropriate and healthy, and that an environment with good ventilation, as well as appropriate and timely medical support will be provided. In the interests of a particular prisoner or for the maintenance of good order and discipline, the Commissioner of Correctional Services is empowered to make arrangements under rule 68B of the Prison Rules that such prisoner should not associate with other prisoners (i.e. the so-called 'solitary confinement'). One of the purposes of the relevant arrangement is to ensure the personal safety and well-being of the PICs, which can be requested by the PICs themselves and approved by the Commissioner after considering the matter in accordance with the law; or the Commissioner may make such arrangements after considering the relevant factors in accordance with the legal requirements and procedures. The CSD has also put in place an established mechanism, including regular independent visitors, namely Justices of the Peace, who inspect the prisons to ensure the rights of PICs are protected.

""As regards the sedition offence, the courts of the HKSAR have ruled in different cases that the provisions relating to sedition are consistent with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights on the protection of human rights, and that a proportionate and reasonable balance has been struck between safeguarding national security and protection of the freedom of speech. The offence does not in any way seek to silence expressions of what are merely genuine criticisms against the Government based on objective facts. In fact, the court's reasons for verdict in a recent Court of Appeal case has pointed out that criticising the Government, the administration of justice including court judgments, or engaging in debates about or raising objections to Government policies or decisions, however strong, vigorous or critical they may be, does not constitute a seditious intention. This provides further clarity in differentiating between lawful and unlawful speech.

""As regards the interim injunction relating to a song granted by the Court of Appeal, the HKSAR Government reiterates that the interim injunction covers four types of specified criminal acts in relation to the concerned song. The injunction pursues the legitimate aim of safeguarding national security and is necessary, reasonable, legitimate, proportionate and consistent with the requirements of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. Internationally, many jurisdictions also have legal mechanisms in place to prohibit the dissemination of information that is illegal, offensive, incites violence, incites hatred or harms the public interest. For example, the EU's Digital Services Act stipulates that upon the receipt of an order to act against a specific item(s) of illegal content, providers of intermediary services shall inform the authority of any effect given to the order without undue delay; it also requires providers of hosting services to put mechanisms in place to combat illegal contents and respond to notices received in a timely manner, including removing and disabling access to the relevant content. The unreasonable criticisms made by the EU against the legitimate legal actions taken by the HKSAR Government shows clearly the double standards held.

""As for prisoners sentenced to imprisonment by the court in accordance with the law, they would not have a right to remission. Non-referral of a prisoner having committed offence endangering national security case to the Post-release Supervision Board is a preventive measure and serves as an adjunct to the rehabilitation of the prisoner. The non-referral does not of itself increase the sentence and should not be regarded as punishment. The court also agreed that the Commissioner of Correctional Services, in performing a function conferred by the Prisons Ordinance and the Post-release Supervision of Prisoners Ordinance, has a duty to safeguard national security and must regard national security as the most important factor and give appropriate consideration to it accordingly. The Correctional Services Department has been handling relevant cases in accordance with the law and established mechanisms. In deciding whether the early release of individual prisoners would be contrary to the interests of national security, the Commissioner will carry out his relevant duties in strict accordance with the laws and deal with every case fairly and impartially.

""The attempts by external forces to 'use Hong Kong to contain China' are doomed to fail, leaving them with no option but to smear the HKNSL, SNSO and other related laws. However, the facts are clear for all to see, and both Hong Kong citizens and international investors have a discerning eye. Over five years of its implementation, the HKNSL has restored the rights and freedoms that Hong Kong citizens were unable to enjoy during the period of 'black-clad violence', and has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to swiftly return to normal and the business environment to be restored and improved continuously. According to the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's ranking improved by two places to third globally. Also, Hong Kong continues to rank among the top three international financial centres and comes fourth in initial public offering in the world. These internationally recognised achievements are built upon the freedom and stability brought to Hong Kong society by the HKNSL, other relevant laws of the HKSAR, and the work of safeguarding national security. They also provide investors and businesses worldwide with ample confidence to develop their operations in Hong Kong and leverage on Hong Kong's institutional advantages under 'one country, two systems' to explore the vast mainland China market, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

""The EU repeatedly uses its soâcalled annual reports to smear the HKSAR, which has been faithfully, dutifully and lawfully safeguarding national security, while turning a blind eye to the fact that the relevant laws have allowed the daily lives and economic activities of the broad masses of Hong Kong residents to return to normal and have restored the business environment. This is a classic example of hypocritical ""double standards"". The EU must immediately act reasonably and sensibly, and stop smearing the laws safeguarding national security in the HKSAR.

Enhancing National Education

The HKSAR Government spokesman pointed out, ""Schools are places for students to learn and grow. It is the obligation of schools to provide a safe and orderly school environment and atmosphere, and to maintain a campus free from political interference or illegal activities, for safeguarding students' well-being. National education has been an important part of the curricula for primary and secondary schools as well as kindergartens with a view to deepening our students' understanding of the country's national affairs, history and culture, the Constitution and the Basic Law, as well as national security, thereby building up students' cultural confidence to foster a sense of national identity, and cultivating them into a new generation that is able and virtuous with a sense of responsibility, visions and love for the country and the city. Teachers are also important role models for their students, playing a vital role in passing on knowledge and nurturing students' character. The HKSAR Government has the responsibility to ensure the professional conduct of teachers. Implementation of national education, including national security education, is the legitimate duty of education authorities all over the world. Different places attach great importance to implementing national security education and developing their students' sense of national identity, including knowledge of their respective constitution, their own history, culture, geography, etc.

""Academic freedom is an important social value treasured in Hong Kong and the cornerstone of our higher education sector. Since the implementation of the HKNSL, academics or post-secondary education institutions in Hong Kong continue to conduct normal exchange activities with their foreign or external counterparts. Meanwhile, post-secondary institutions in Hong Kong have taken a series of measures to incorporate national security education into students' learning in fulfilment of their statutory duty. These institutions enjoy autonomy on curriculum design, and the HKSAR Government encourages the institutions to provide students with diversified learning opportunities on national security education.""

Maintaining Long-term Prosperity and Stability 

The HKSAR Government spokesman stressed, ""Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the HKSAR Government has been fully, faithfully and resolutely implementing the principles of 'one country, two systems', 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' and a high degree of autonomy in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has entered a new stage of advancing from stability to prosperity.

""Under 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the distinctive advantage of enjoying strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world. Hong Kong is a member in the World Trade Organization and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in its own right. With the unparalleled connectivity to the Mainland and the rest of the world, Hong Kong will continue to play its unique role as ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"". The stable environment benefitted from the implementation of HKNSL has served Hong Kong well to produce strong and ever-growing trade performance with the world, including that the EU continues to be one of Hong Kong's top trading partners. In addition, according to the Economic Freedom of the World 2024 Annual Report released by the Fraser Institute, Hong Kong is ranked the freest economy in the world, ranking first in ""freedom to trade internationally"" and ""regulation"". Also, in the World Competitiveness Yearbook 2025, Hong Kong's overall ranking has moved up by two places from the previous year to become one of the world's top three most competitive economies, and it even tops the rankings in ""business legislation"" and ""tax policy"". Hong Kong will continue to leverage its strengths to enhance its role as international financial, maritime and trade centres, among others, whilst proactively integrating into the overall development of our nation, including the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area development, the high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative, etc.. The HKSAR Government will also continue to create strong impetus for growth at full steam and proactively compete for enterprises and talents to strengthen the city's competitiveness.""

The spokesman reiterated, ""Any attempt by foreign countries or external forces to undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability by slandering the city will only expose their own weakness and faulty arguments and be doomed to fail.

​特區政府強烈不滿和反對歐洲聯盟委員會年度報告,2025-09-09 23:13,2025-09-09 23:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900882.htm,"香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（九月九日）就歐洲聯盟（歐盟）委員會及歐洲聯盟外交與安全政策高級代表發表所謂年度報告中針對香港特區維護國家安全、保障人權等方面的不實和偏頗內容，表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人強調：「香港特區是中華人民共和國不可分離的部分，在『一國兩制』下是一個享有高度自治權、直轄於中央人民政府的地方行政區域。『一國兩制』的實施以《憲法》和《基本法》為法律依據，它們為基本權利和自由提供憲制上的保證，包括法律面前一律平等的權利保證，及其在法治和獨立司法權之下得以鞏固。」

「特區政府堅定不移全面準確實施《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》，在依法有效應對、打擊、阻嚇和防止危害國家安全的行為和活動的同時，依法保障香港居民的權利和自由，確保『一國兩制』實踐行穩致遠。特區政府強烈敦促歐盟尊重事實並遵從它們口口聲聲奉行的國際法和國際關係的基本準則，立即停止長臂管轄、干涉純屬中國內政的香港事務。」

維護司法公正和法治精神

特區政府發言人指出：「特區政府維護獨立的司法權，全力支持司法機構依法獨立行使審判權，維護司法公正和法治精神。建立香港特區維護國家安全的機制不會損害獨立司法權，香港特區司法制度亦繼續受《基本法》保障。法官在處理危害國家安全犯罪案件時，一如其他案件，都是獨立公正地履行司法職責，不受任何干涉。五年來的實踐證明，法院嚴格按照上述原則處理涉及《香港國安法》的案件。」

「事實上，普通法司法區早已確立司法機關須尊重行政機關對國家安全的判斷這個原則，而上訴法庭在二○二四年五月的一項重要判決中裁定，法院在尊重行政機關對國家安全的判斷的同時，至少在三個範疇下法院會作出判決：第一，涉及受措施影響人士的基本權利；第二，涉及公平審訊規定的爭議；第三，涉及司法公開的問題。」

發言人強調：「香港法治固若金湯、歷久不變。香港法治並無任何倒退，任何指稱香港正成為一個『極權』城市的說法絕非事實。香港的普通法制度是多年來由包括各級法院法官在內的香港司法界和法律界全體共同努力打造和維護，不會因個別海外非常任法官離任而有所改變。儘管有法官離任，兩位海外非常任法官剛於去年和今年獲委任。」

「司法機關依法獨立行使審判權，而所有面對刑事指控的人都享有接受公平審訊的權利。法院嚴格按照證據和所有適用法律判案。案件不會因涉案者的職業、政治理念或背景而在處理上有所不同。控方有責任在毫無合理疑點下證明被告人犯罪，被告人才可被法庭定罪。」

保障權利和自由

特區政府發言人表示：「特區政府堅定維護香港居民受到法律保障的權利和自由。自香港回歸祖國以來，人權一直受到《憲法》和《基本法》的堅實憲制保障。香港特區維護國家安全的法律亦特別重視人權。《香港國安法》第四條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條清楚訂明香港特區維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》和《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港，有關言論、新聞、出版、結社、集會等方面的權利和自由。然而，與世界其他地方一樣，有關權利和自由並非絕對，《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚訂明，在有必要保障國家安全、公共安全、公共秩序或他人的權利和自由等情況下，可以依法限制部分權利和自由。」

「但事實上，自《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》實施以來，本港的傳媒環境蓬勃依然。惟部分別有用心人士卻刻意捏造有關香港新聞和言論自由的事實。與世界其他地方一樣，新聞和言論自由並非絕對，傳媒與其他人一樣都有義務遵守所有法律。只要不違法，傳媒繼續享有評論和批評政府施政的自由，全然不受限制。法庭在相關案件的裁決理由也引用了歐洲人權法院關於新聞自由的判例，指出即使是報道涉及備受公眾關注的重要議題，在《歐洲人權公約》下也不享有完全不受限制的言論自由；最重要的一點是，新聞工作者必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由權利保障。」

維護國家安全相關法律

特區政府發言人表示：「根據《聯合國憲章》為基礎的國際法及國際關係，每個國家都會制定維護國家安全法律，這既是主權國家的固有權利，也是國際慣例。歐盟對香港特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制指手畫腳，全然漠視香港特區訂立相關法律的憲制責任和實際需要，以及在維護國家安全的相關法律訂立後，對經濟發展和人權保障所帶來的正面效果，是實實在在的雙重標準。」

「中央二○二○年果斷制定《香港國安法》，特區政府隨即公布實施，填補了香港特區維護國家安全法律制度和執行機制的短板漏洞，效果立竿見影，止暴制亂，讓香港居民重新享有在黑暴期間被剝奪的權利和自由，發揮止暴制亂的作用。《香港國安法》的公布實施成為香港『由亂到治』的分水嶺，『一法安香江』。在二○二四年，香港特區切實履行憲制責任訂立《維護國家安全條例》，完善了特區維護國家安全的法律制度和執行機制。事實上，在《基本法》第二十三條立法諮詢期間，有98.6%的意見表示支持及提出正面意見，反映立法在社會有很強的共識，亦是民心所向。」

「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。香港特區執法部門一直根據證據、嚴格依照法律，以及按有關的人或單位的行為而採取執法行動，與其政治立場、背景或職業無關。」

「由於黎智英案、『35+』串謀顛覆國家政權案及支聯會案等所涉及的法律程序尚在進行中，任何人均不宜評論有關案件。特區政府必須強調，所有案件均嚴格根據證據和依照法律處理，律政司按《基本法》第六十三條主管刑事檢控工作，不受任何干涉，所有檢控決定是基於所有可接納的證據和適用法律進行客觀分析後作出。檢控機關和司法機關嚴格履行《香港國安法》第四十二條第一款的責任，確保所有危害國家安全犯罪案件得到公正、及時辦理，過程中充分尊重被告人依法行使各項程序權利，絕對不存在所謂『延誤審訊』的情況。」

「《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》下危害國家安全罪行的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法，實屬必要和正當，並與世界其他國家和地區一致。包括歐盟成員國在內眾多國家的國家安全法律，同樣根據『屬人管轄』和『保護管轄』等原則，具有域外效力。」

「警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法追究在境外涉嫌危害國家安全的惡行。該等一直潛藏外地的潛逃者被通緝，是因為他們在當地繼續公然從事危害國家安全的勾當，包括煽動分裂國家及請求外國對中華人民共和國及香港特區進行『制裁』、封鎖及採取其他敵對行動，並繼續肆意勾結外部勢力包庇其惡行。他們危害國家安全的惡行昭然若揭，明顯嚴重危害國家安全，無庸置疑。警方作為特區維護國家安全的執法部門，有責任依法進行通緝，及有需要採取一切合法措施，包括《維護國家安全條例》第89條下指明的措施，強烈打擊有關潛逃行為，其做法有理有據，實屬必要和正當。而香港特區維護國家安全相關法律的域外效力，完全符合國際法原則、國際慣例和各國各地區通行做法。不少國家也會就不同的通緝犯施行類似措施，包括撤銷護照。」

「懲教署一直極為重視在囚人士的安全及健康。不論在囚人士的身分、年齡和國籍，署方一直致力為其提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境，包括提供良好的通風環境、合適和及時的醫療支援。為某囚犯的利益或為維持秩序或紀律，懲教署署長根據《監獄規例》第68B條可作出有關囚犯不應與其他囚犯交往的安排（即所謂的『單獨監禁』）。有關安排的其中一個目的是保障囚犯的人身安全和福祉，可由該囚犯自行提出要求、由懲教署署長依法考慮後審批，或由懲教署署長根據法律規定及程序，在考量了相關的因素後而作出。懲教署也設有一系列機制，例如透過獨立訪客（即太平紳士）定期巡視的安排，以確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。」

「至於煽動罪方面，香港特區法庭於不同案件中均已確認有關煽動的條文符合《基本法》和《香港人權法案》中有關保障人權的條文，亦確認在維護國家安全和保障言論自由之間已取得相稱而合理的平衡。有關罪行絕非要壓制僅屬根據客觀事實而對政府作出正當批評的言論。事實上，上訴法庭在最近的判決指出，『煽動意圖』的定義與表達自由的基本權利一起正確閱讀時，清晰顯示，批評政府、司法行政包括法院判決，或參與辯論或提出對政府政策或決定的異議，無論多麼強烈、有力或尖銳，都不構成煽動意圖，這進一步澄清了合法和非法言論之間的區別。」

「關於上訴法庭就一首歌曲頒布的臨時禁制令，特區政府重申禁制令針對與該歌曲有關的四項指明刑事行為。為維護國家安全這個正當目的，禁制令是必要、合理、合法、相稱及符合相關人權法案的要求。國際上，很多司法管轄區都有法律機制禁止違法、具有冒犯性、煽動暴力、煽動仇恨或損害公衆利益的信息傳播。例如歐盟的《數字服務法案》規定中介服務供應商收到有關當局要求對非法內容採取行動後，必須及時通知當局其所作的行動；並要求主機服務商須建立機制打擊非法內容及在收到通知後須及時採取應對行動，包括移除及封鎖相關內容。歐盟對特區政府的正當法律行動作出無理批評顯然是持有雙重標準。」

「至於被法庭依法判處在監獄服刑的在囚人士，從來沒有必然獲得提早釋放或者減刑的權利。懲教署署長不轉介犯危害國家安全罪行的在囚人士的個案予監管釋囚委員會，是一項考慮到國家安全的重要性的預防措施，亦有助相關在囚人士改過自新。不轉介有關個案並無增加在囚人士的刑期，也不能被視為對在囚人士的懲罰。法庭亦同意懲教署署長根據《監獄條例》及《監管釋囚條例》賦予的職權行使職務時有責任維護國家安全，亦必須將國家安全視為最重要因素，並給予適當考慮。懲教署一直依法和按既定機制處理有關個案，在決定提早釋放個別在囚人士是否不會不利於國家安全，署長會考慮個案的實際情況及所有相關資料和因素，嚴格依照所有相關法律、公平公正地處理每宗個案。」

「外部勢力『以港遏華』的圖謀無法得逞，只好抹黑詆毀《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》及特區其他相關法律。但事實擺在眼前，香港市民和國際投資者的眼睛都是雪亮的。《香港國安法》實施五年多以來，恢復了香港市民在『黑暴』期間無法享有的權利和自由，以及讓廣大香港市民生活和經濟活動迅速回復正常，營商環境得以恢復並不斷提升。根據《2025年世界競爭力年報》，香港的排名躍升兩位至全球第三；香港在全球國際金融中心中位列三甲，並在全球首次公開招股市場中位列前四名。這些國際認可的成就都是建基於《香港國安法》及其他特區相關法律和維護國家安全工作為香港社會帶來的自由、安穩，亦給予世界各地的投資者和企業充足的信心在香港發展業務，及善用香港『一國兩制』的制度優勢開拓包括粵港澳大灣區在內的內地廣大市場。」

「歐盟一再通過所謂年度報告詆毀盡責、忠誠和依法維護國家安全的香港特區，而對相關法律讓廣大香港居民生活和經濟活動回復正常、營商環境恢復的實況置若罔聞。此實乃典型的虛偽『雙標』。歐盟必須立即重回正道，停止抹黑香港特區維護國家安全相關法律和工作。」

加強國民教育

特區政府發言人指出：「學校是學生學習和成長的地方，學校有責任提供安全有序的校園環境和氛圍，防止政治干預或違法活動入侵校園，以保障學生福祉。國民教育一直是香港中小學及幼稚園課程重要部分，以加強學生對國情、歷史和文化、《憲法》和《基本法》、以及國家安全的認識，建立文化自信，提升國民身分認同，培育他們成為德才兼備，有承擔、有視野、愛國愛港的新一代。此外，教師是學生的重要楷模，肩負知識傳承、熏陶品德的重要職責，特區政府有責任確保教師的專業操守。實施包括國家安全教育在內的國民教育，是世界各地教育當局正當合理的責任，不同地方對實施國家安全教育及培養學生國民身分，包括對各自的憲法、自身歷史、文化、地理等知識，均十分重視。」

「學術自由是香港一直推崇的重要社會價值，亦是香港高等教育界賴以成功的基石。自《香港國安法》實施以來，本港學者和專上院校繼續與境外和校外合作夥伴進行正常交流活動。同時，本地專上院校已採取一系列措施，將國家安全教育納入學生的學習範圍，以履行其法定責任。各院校在課程設計上享有自主，特區政府鼓勵其就國家安全教育為學生提供多元化的學習機會。」

保持長期繁榮穩定

​特區政府發言人強調：「自香港回歸祖國以來，特區政府按照《憲法》和《基本法》，全面準確、堅定不移貫徹落實『一國兩制』、『港人治港』、高度自治的方針，保持香港長期繁榮穩定，並已踏上由治及興的新階段。

「在『一國兩制』下，香港擁有『背靠祖國、聯通世界』此得天獨厚的顯著優勢。香港是世界貿易組織及亞太區經濟合作組織的單獨成員。香港會憑藉連接內地與世界各地的獨特優勢，繼續充分發揮其作為『超級聯繫人』和『超級增值人』的角色。實施《香港國安法》為香港帶來的穩定環境有利於香港與世界各地達致強勁且持續的貿易增長，包括歐盟繼續是香港最大的貿易夥伴之一。此外，根據菲沙研究所發布的《世界經濟自由度 2024年度報告》，香港是全球最自由經濟體，在「國際貿易自由」及「監管」均位列首位。在《2025年世界競爭力年報》中，香港整體排名較去年上升兩位，晉身全球首三位最具競爭力的經濟體，在「商業法規」和「税務政策」更是排名全球第一。香港會繼續發揮其優勢以鞏固國際金融、航運和貿易中心等地位，以及積極融入國家發展大局包括參與粵港澳大灣區建設、『一帶一路』高質量發展等。特區政府亦會繼續全力增強發展動能，及更積極進取地招商引才，以提升香港競爭力。」

​​發言人重申：「任何外國或外部勢力詆毀香港，試圖破壞香港繁榮穩定，只會自暴其短，理屈詞窮，絕不會得逞。特區政府定當繼續堅定履職，堅持法治原則，致力確保『一國兩制』、『港人治港』、高度自治的方針實踐行穩致遠，更好結合『有為政府』和『高效市場』，更積極進取地招商引才，提升香港競爭力，推動香港經濟走上更高台階，為市民謀幸福，為香港謀發展。」"

Fatal traffic accident in Kowloon City,2025-09-09 23:06,2025-09-09 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900924.htm," Police are investigating a fatal traffic accident in Kowloon City this afternoon (September 9), in which a woman died.

Hong Kong enters its summer influenza season with another case of severe paediatric influenza A infection reported,2025-09-09 21:26,2025-09-09 21:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900855.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (September 9) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection. The CHP also reminded members of the public that the local influenza activity has further increased over the past week, indicating that Hong Konghas entered the summer influenza season. Members of the public should maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Schools and parents should arrange for children to participate in the seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) programmes at the start of the new school year to receive free vaccination and prevent respiratory infections.

New case of severe paediatric influenza A infection
-------------------------------------------------------------

The case involves a 15-year-old boy who developed a fever, sore throat, coughing and vomiting yesterday (September 8). He attended a private hospital and was admitted to its paediatric intensive care unit. His nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A complicated with septic shock. He was transferred to a general ward today and is in stable condition. So far, his household contacts are asymptomatic.

The CHP investigation revealed that the boy had received the 2024/25 seasonal influenza vaccine. Five other students in his class recently developed mild influenza-like symptoms between September 5 and 6. They sought medical treatment and none of them required hospitalisation. No outbreaks have been reported in other classes at the school so far. The CHP advised the school on the necessary infection control measures to be implemented and will continue to put the school under medical surveillance.

Since last Friday (September 5), five cases of severe paediatric influenza A infection have been recorded. This marked the first occurrence of severe paediatric cases since mid-April this year. Since January this year, the CHP has recorded a cumulative total of 16 cases of severe influenza virus infections in children. Ten of them were unvaccinated in the 2024/25 season.

Influenza activity continues to rise
-----------------------------------------
 
After cautiously monitoring influenza trends over the past two weeks, the CHP determined that Hong Kong has entered the summer influenza season. Summer influenza seasons do not occur every year. During the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic (between 2010 and 2019), Hong Kong experienced a summer influenza season in five years. The summer influenza seasons usually occurred between July and August, and lasted for six to 18 weeks. The CHP anticipated that the local influenza activity would remain at a relatively high level in the near term.

According to preliminary surveillance data, the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for seasonal influenza viruses during the week of August 31 to September 6 was 6.94 per cent (provisional figure), higher than the 6.16 per cent recorded during the preceding week (August 24 to 30).

Regarding outbreaks influenza-like illness (ILI) in schools and residential care homes (RCHs), the CHP recorded 26 outbreaks during the week of August 31 to September 6, affecting a total of 259 individuals, nearly doubling from the 14 outbreaks (affecting 81 individuals) reported during the previous week (August 24 to 30). With the start of the new school term, there has been a significant increase in ILI outbreaks in schools. The number of outbreaks rose from four (affecting 25 people) in the week ending August 30 to 15 (affecting 202 people) in the week ending September 6. In the first three days of this week (September 7 to 9), 24 school outbreaks (affecting 276 people) were recorded, with four cases involving 20 to 98 people. The CHP staff have inspected these schools and advised the schools on necessary infection control measures. These included recommending that students wear masks on campus, appropriately opening windows to improve ventilation in individual activity rooms and classrooms, thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting the campus, and suspending inter-class and inter-grade activities. The CHP also advised teachers and students to check their temperature daily before returning to school. If they develop symptoms or fever, they should not go to school. The CHP will continue to put these schools and RCHs under medical surveillance.

Vaccination effectively prevents severe cases of seasonal influenza and its complications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vaccination has been scientifically proven to be one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risks of in-patient admission and mortality due to seasonal influenza. The Government has all along been encouraging the public to receive vaccination as early as possible, and providing free and subsidised seasonal influenza vaccines to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. During the previous influenza season (2024/25), approximately 2.09 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines were administered under various SIV Programmes, setting a new historical high. Severe influenza cases among adults and children decreased significantly by 20 per cent and 60 per cent respectively, compared to the influenza seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. It is believed to be attributable to higher vaccination rates.

The DH announced yesterday (September 8) that the 2025/26 SIV Programmes would commence on September 25 to provide a free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. A number of new initiatives have been introduced to encourage and enable public participation, including further enhancing the SIV School Outreach Programme so that all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools being allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities. Approximately 2 300 schools (99 per cent) have joined the outreach programme. To safeguard students' health, the CHP will publish a list of schools not participating in the programme on its official website to remind parents to promptly arrange for children in those schools to receive vaccinations from family doctors.

To make vaccinations more accessible, the Government will open all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the 25 District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission, and 74 general outpatient clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP's Vaccination Schemes page. Starting from 9am on September 22, parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via the online booking system.

The CHP reminded high-risk persons to wear surgical masks when visiting public places. The general public should also wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly, and consider whether to go to work or school. For the latest information on seasonal influenza, members of the public can visit the CHP's seasonal influenza and COVID-19 & Flu Express webpages.

Cyber Security Exercise SWORDLIFTER held by Hong Kong Police Force in preparation for National Games (with photos),2025-09-09 20:33,2025-09-09 21:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900821.htm,"The Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) of the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) conducted the Cyber Security Seminar cum Tabletop Exercise, codenamed SWORDLIFTER, at the Police Headquarters today (September 9). The event aimed to enhance cyber resilience, incident reporting co-ordination and immediate response capabilities of relevant stakeholders in preparation for the 15th National Games (NG), the 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities (NGD) and the 9th National Special Olympic Games (NSOG).

Speaking at the seminar, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Crime), Ms Chung Wing-man, stated that the co-hosting of the 15th NG, the 12th NGD and the 9th NSOG by Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao carries great significance. As one of the host cities, Hong Kong shoulders the responsibilities and has the capability to strengthen its cybersecurity defenses, ensuring that the Games can be carried out in a safe, orderly and secure manner.

The seminar focused on the cyber threats faced and deployment strategies adopted during major sporting events in the past. Industry leaders were invited to share local and overseas case studies and best practices. Topics covered prevention of phishing and counterfeit tickets websites, website security, system intrusion protection and social media account security, in order to enhance the cybersecurity awareness of stakeholders.

The tabletop exercise adopted an integrated scenario simulating pre-event situations where the organiser and relevant stakeholders received malicious and false information, their official websites or related pages were hijacked, and critical infrastructures faced cyberattacks, etc. During the exercise, participants conducted incident analysis, multi-agency reporting and recovery operations, with a view to better understanding the potential impacts of different cyberattacks and corresponding response processes.

Joined by more than 100 representatives from over 30 departments, units and organisations, including the National Games Coordination Office (Hong Kong), venue operators, various government departments, transportation and public organisations, as well as relevant sports associations, the event concluded successfully and affirmed the importance of cross-sector collaboration.

HKPF will maintain close liaison with all stakeholders to ensure thorough preparations for the upcoming 15th NG and the smooth running of the events."

香港已進入夏季流感季節　再添一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案,2025-09-09 20:15,2025-09-09 20:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900814.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（九月九日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案。此外，中心提醒市民本地季節性流感的活躍程度過去一星期進一步上升，顯示香港已進入夏季流感季節。市民應時刻保持良好個人和環境衞生，學校和家長應在新學年盡早安排學童參與季節性流感疫苗接種計劃，免費接種流感疫苗，以預防感染呼吸道疾病。

最新兒童甲型流感嚴重個案
————————————

個案涉及一名15歲男童，他昨日（九月八日）開始出現發燒、喉嚨痛、咳嗽及嘔吐，到私家醫院求診，獲安排在該院的兒童深切治療部留醫。他的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H3）病毒呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發敗血性休克。他今日已轉往普通病房留醫，情況穩定。他的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵。

中心調查發現，男童曾接種二○二四／二五季度流感疫苗，他就讀的班別近日有另外五名學生在九月五日至六日期間出現輕微流感病徵，他們已求醫，全部無需入院。其他班別暫時未有出現爆發情況。中心已向校方建議需實施的感染控制措施，並會繼續對該校進行醫學監察。

自上周五（九月五日）起已錄得五宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，是自今年四月中後再次錄得兒童嚴重個案。自今年一月起，中心累計接獲16宗兒童感染流感病毒的嚴重個案，當中10宗未有接種二○二四／二五季度的疫苗。

流感活躍程度持續上升
——————————

經審慎監察近兩周流感的趨勢後，中心判斷本地已進入夏季流感季節。夏季流感季節並非每年也出現，新冠疫情前的十年（二○一○年至二○一九年）期間，本地共有五年曾出現夏季流感季節，一般在七月至八月間出現，維持介乎六至18星期。中心預料本地流感活躍程度會在短期內維持在較高水平。

根據初步監測數據，在八月三十一日至九月六日的一周，呼吸道樣本中流感病毒檢測呈陽性的百分比為6.94（臨時數字），高於上一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的百分比為6.16。

學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發方面，中心在八月三十一日至九月六日的一周錄得 26 宗涉及學校或院舍的流感樣疾病爆發（共影響259人），比上一周（八月二十四日至三十日）的14宗（共影響81人）增加近一倍。隨着新學期開始，學校出現的流感樣疾病爆發個案顯著增加，由截至八月三十日的一周四宗爆發個案（共影響25人），上升至截至九月六日的一周15宗爆發個案（共影響202人）。本周首三天（九月七日至九日）已錄得24宗學校爆發個案（共影響276人），當中四宗個案涉及20至98人。中心已派員在該些學校視察，並向校方建議需實施的感染控制措施，包括建議學生在校內佩戴口罩、適當開啓窗戶以改善個別活動室及班房的通風情況、徹底清潔消毒校園，及停止進行跨班別和跨級別活動。中心亦建議師生每天返校前檢查體溫，如出現病徵或發燒，不應上學。中心會繼續對出現爆發個案的學校及院舍進行醫學監察。

疫苗有效預防季節性流感重症及其併發症
——————————————————

根據科學實證，接種疫苗是預防季節性流感重症及其併發症的最有效方法之一，亦可減低感染流感而導致入院留醫的機會和死亡的風險。政府一直鼓勵市民盡早接種流感疫苗，並透過各項疫苗注射計劃為合資格的高風險群組提供免費及資助季節性流感疫苗。上一年度（二○二四／二五年）衞生署的各項疫苗接種計劃共接種約209萬劑季節性流感疫苗，創下歷史新高。成人和兒童嚴重流感個案較新冠疫情前的流感季節分別顯著下跌兩成和六成，相信是歸功於疫苗接種率上升。

衞生署昨日（九月八日）公布二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃將於九月二十五日展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。當中包括多項新措施鼓勵和便利市民接種，包括進一步優化季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，讓所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。目前已有約2 300間學校（99%）參與外展計劃。中心稍後會將不參與計劃的學校名單上載至中心網頁，以提醒有關學校的家長盡快自行安排子女到家庭醫生接種疫苗，守護學童健康。

為了讓市民更加方便接種疫苗，政府會繼續開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下的25個地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間普通科門診和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可由九月二十二日上午九時起透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

中心提醒高危人士到公眾地方時，應佩戴外科口罩。市民乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，亦應考慮佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，並考慮應否上班或上學。有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"
"LegCo Secretariat releases Policy Pulse on ""Expanding global economic and trade network""",2025-09-09 20:08,2025-09-09 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900787.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Legislative Council Secretariat:

  The 10th Belt and Road Summit, jointly organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, will be held in Hong Kong tomorrow and Thursday (September 10 and 11). The Summit brings together senior government officials and business leaders from various countries to explore business opportunities, serving as a key platform for deepening Hong Kong's economic and trade ties with countries and regions along the Belt and Road (B&R). As the Summit approaches, the Legislative Council (LegCo) Secretariat today (September 9) released the latest issue of the Policy Pulse on ""Expanding global economic and trade network"".

  The Policy Pulse provides an overview ofHong Kong's latest developmentsas an international trade centre under the support of the National 14th Five-Year Plan. It highlights Hong Kong's unique advantages in economic and trade, demonstrating how the city leverages its roles as a ""super connector"" and a ""super value-adder"" to continuously expand the economic and trade network, while also summarising relevant discussions in LegCo.

  The Policy Pulse points out that, with its four ""success factors"", namely free trade policies, world-class infrastructure, the common law system and sound rule of law, as well as the institutional strengths of ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong becomes one of the world's most competitive trading hubs. The SAR Government has also been adopting a multipronged approach to expand Hong Kong's global economic and trade network.

  The publication highlights Hong Kong's active expansion of trade and investment agreements network, having signed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with 21 economies and Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (IPPAs) with 33 economies, with negotiations on an IPPA with Qatar largely concluded. LegCo Members urge the Government to strive to forge FTAs and IPPAs with more economies, with particular focus on emerging markets in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Middle East, while supporting Hong Kong enterprises in market expansion to Latin America.

  The Policy Pulse also introduces the SAR Government's proactive efforts to join the world's largest FTA – the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) – with the goal ofreducing international trade costs and barriers. It points out that Hong Kong's accessionto RCEP will help deepen trade ties among RCEP members, assisting them in participating in the B&R Initiative and facilitating their access to the Mainland market. LegCo has been actively rallying support from various parties for Hong Kong's early accession to RCEP. For instance, the President of LegCo led duty visits to three ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore) and Japan respectively, and met with Consuls-General in Hong Kong and parliamentarians from various countries to explain how Hong Kong's accession to RCEP would be conducive to achieving mutual benefits and win-win outcomes. Members also suggest that the Government should focus on promoting related supporting industries that can benefit from RCEP when planning the Northern Metropolis.

  Furthermore,the Policy Pulse details multiple initiatives by the SAR Government to attract enterprises and investment, including the development of a multinational supply chain management centre, attracting Mainland enterprises to set up international or regional headquarters in Hong Kong to manage offshore trade and supply chains, and supporting Mainland enterprises in ""going global"". Through the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), Hong Kong's access to the Mainland's goods and services markets has further opened up, enhancing the attractiveness of Hong Kong to overseas investors, and positioning Hong Kong as a perfect springboard for Mainland enterprises to ""go global"". The Second Agreement Concerning Amendment to CEPA Agreement on Trade in Services signed last year further facilitates Hong Kong service suppliers in establishing and developing businesses on the Mainland.

  The Policy Pulse notes that the B&R Initiative is a far-reaching national development strategy. Leveraging Hong Kong's distinctive advantages, the city has become the prime functional platform for the B&R Initiative. The SAR Government has been proactively expanding presence in emerging markets, with recent key initiatives including the Chief Executive's visit to the Middle East to strengthen economic and trade ties, the expansion of Hong Kong's global office network particularly in emerging markets, and the enhancement of the Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading and Domestic Salesto assist enterprises in developing non-local markets.

  The Policy Pulse summarises various recommendations made by Members for expanding Hong Kong's global economic and trade network. These include comprehensively co-ordinating and strengthening efforts in attracting enterprises and investment; reviewing and enhancing the division of responsibilities and functions among relevant government departments and public organisations to avoid duplication of resources; establishing sound industry and supply chains to assist enterprises in ""going global and attracting foreign investment""; formulating and promoting the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area standards in more different areas, with a view to assisting Hong Kong businesses in utilising the preferential measures under CEPA to tap into the Mainland market; encouraging local airlines to operate more international flights between Hong Kong and Middle East cities in order to facilitate business and tourism; and attracting enterprises and family offices from B&R countries to set up or expand their businesses in Hong Kong.

  The detailed content of ""Expanding global economic and trade network"" is available on the LegCo website. The Policy Pulse, published by the Council Business Divisions of the LegCo Secretariat, covers specific topics and offers a comprehensive overview of related policy developments and summarised discussions in LegCo."
"InvestHK hosts ""Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises' Global Expansion"" seminar to showcase city's unique strengths as multinational supply chain and treasury management centre (with photos)",2025-09-09 20:00,2025-09-09 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900738.htm,"  Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) today (September 9) hosted a seminar entitled ""Hong Kong - The Ideal Platform for Mainland Enterprises' Global Expansion"". The event brought together over 120 representatives from Mainland enterprises to explore leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages as a multinational supply chain management and international financial centre to support Mainland enterprises in expanding globally.

  The seminar, supported by the Belt and Road Office of the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, was attended by guests including the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan; Vice Chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) Mr Li Zhen; the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau; and the Permanent Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Ms Maggie Wong.

  Mr Chan delivered his opening remarks, ""Hong Kong is the country's southern gateway. Under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, we possess the unique advantages of connectivity with the Mainland and the world, international and multicultural inclusiveness. Our institutional strengths also include the practice of common law; free port status and free trade; zero tariffs and efficient customs clearance procedures, an extensive logistics network and world-class port infrastructure; as well as robust financial markets and professional services and many more. Hong Kong not only serves as a platform supporting Mainland enterprises to go global; our dynamic financial markets also facilitate capital raising to support their overseas business development.""

  Mr Chan added, ""It has become an established trend for Mainland enterprises to go global into the Global South and Belt and Road countries, deploying their supply chains and industrial chains while exploring more diversified markets. In response to this trend, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government has been promoting the city's development as a multinational supply chain management hub in recent years. InvestHK, the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council of the HKSAR have established mechanisms and dedicated teams to jointly assist Mainland enterprises in setting up international and regional headquarters in Hong Kong for offshore trade and supply chain management. We provide one-stop advisory services to support your global supply chain deployment and overseas market expansion.""

  Mr Li said, ""Amid profound changes in the global landscape, Hong Kong, leveraging its unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, has increasingly demonstrated its role in connecting global resources and linking international markets. It has become a crucial strategic pivot for Mainland enterprises' global expansion. Mainland enterprises have achieved substantial results in Hong Kong. As of the end of June 2025, there were 121 central State-owned enterprises listed companies in Hong Kong, with a total market capitalisation of approximately RMB5.1 trillion. In 2024, the import and export volume of non-mineral goods trade between the Mainland and Hong Kong reached US$33.2 billion, fully demonstrating Hong Kong's value as a global hub for industrial and supply chain collaboration, a platform for capital financing, and a highland for innovation co-operation.""

  Mr Li continued, ""In the future, SASAC will support central enterprises in leveraging Hong Kong as a gateway to strengthen global industrial and supply chain collaboration, broaden funding channels, participate in international standard governance, attract global talent, and deepen co-operation with various sectors in Hong Kong. It is believed that under the impetus of the 'dual circulation' paradigm and the Belt and Road initiative, Hong Kong is bound to provide even stronger support for Mainland enterprises' globalisation, enabling them to achieve new breakthroughs in serving the broader national development strategy.""

  The Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK, Ms Alpha Lau, said, ""As a leading international financial and trading hub in Asia, Hong Kong has become the preferred gateway for Mainland enterprises to expand globally. The city possesses unparalleled connectivity, serving as an international logistics hub and global trading centre with a free, open, and well-regulated business environment. Furthermore, Hong Kong possesses robust financial and capital markets, efficient financing channels, a highly transparent legal environment, and talent pool - making it the ideal base for international operations and capital management. At the same time, the Northern Metropolis, as a new engine for Hong Kong's future development, will inject new economic momentum by providing additional land for innovation and technology purposes.""

  The seminar featured two thematic panel discussions, where representatives from Mainland enterprises and Hong Kong industry leaders shared their strategies and experiences in global markets.

  The first discussion, themed ""Strategic Development of Multinational Supply Chain in the Midst of Global Changes"", was moderated by the Head of Transport, Logistics and Industrials at InvestHK, Mr Benjamin Wong. The panel guests discussed how Mainland enterprises are responding to geopolitical situation, multinational supply chain restructuring, and technological transformation. They explored strategies on leveraging Hong Kong's advantages in offshore trading, supply chain digitalisation transformation, strengthening trade settlement and financing, and positioning Hong Kong as a platform for international logistics and commodities trading.

  The second discussion, themed ""Leveraging Hong Kong's Financial Strengths to Empower Mainland Enterprises' Global Operations"", was moderated by the Global Head of Financial Services, Fintech & Sustainability at InvestHK, Mr King Leung. The panel guests explored how Mainland enterprises leverage Hong Kong to establish corporate treasury centres, optimise cross-border fund pool management structures, and reduce foreign exchange and financing risks. It also delved into the adoption opportunities of fintech and Renminbi internationalisation in supporting Mainland enterprises to expand globally.

  The seminar successfully facilitated in-depth dialogue between Mainland enterprises and Hong Kong industry leaders, reinforcing Hong Kong as a premier platform for Mainland enterprises' global expansion."
投資推廣署舉辦「香港：內地企業全球化首選平台」研討會　展示香港作為跨國供應鏈及財資管理中心的獨特優勢 （附圖）,2025-09-09 20:00,2025-09-09 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900728.htm,"​投資推廣署（投資署）今日（九月九日）舉辦「香港：內地企業全球化首選平台」研討會。活動匯聚逾120位內地企業代表出席，探討香港如何憑藉其作為跨國供應鏈管理中心及國際金融中心的獨特優勢，助力內地企業發展海外業務。

研討會由商務及經濟發展局（商經局）「一帶一路」辦公室支持，出席嘉賓包括財政司司長陳茂波、國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）副主任李鎮、商經局局長丘應樺，以及商經局常任秘書長黃少珠。

陳茂波為活動致開幕辭時表示：「香港是國家的南大門，在『一國兩制』下，擁有內聯外通、國際化和多元包容的獨特優勢。我們的制度優勢還包括實施普通法；維持自由港地位和自由貿易政策；零關稅和高效的清關手續、四通八達的物流網絡和港口基建；卓越的金融市場和專業服務等。香港不但是助力內地企業出海的平台，我們蓬勃的金融市場，也能支持內地企業籌募資金發展海外業務。」

陳茂波補充：「當前內地企業『走出去』到全球南方和『一帶一路』沿線和相關國家，布局供應鏈和產業鏈、並開拓更多元化的市場，已是大勢所趨。因應這大勢，香港特別行政區（特區）政府近年積極推動香港成為服務大家的跨國供應鏈管理中心。特區政府投資署、引進重點企業辦公室和香港貿易發展局建立了機制和專門團隊，聯手助力內地企業來港建立離岸貿易和供應鏈管理的國際和區域總部，為大家提供一站式諮詢服務，協助大家部署環球供應鏈和擴展海外市場。」

李鎮表示：「當前全球格局深刻調整，香港憑藉『一國兩制』的獨特優勢，在對接全球資源、鏈接國際市場方面的作用愈發突顯，是內地企業全球化進程中不可或缺的戰略支點。中央企業在港發展成果豐碩，截至二○二五年六月底，在港控股上市公司達121家，總市值約5.1萬億人民幣，二○二四年與香港非礦貨物貿易進出口額達332億美元，充分體現了香港作為全球產供鏈協同樞紐、資金融通平台、創新合作高地的價值。」

李鎮續指：「未來，國資委將支持中央企業以香港為紐帶，強化全球產供鏈協同，拓寬資金供給渠道，參與國際標準治理，匯聚全球英才，深化與香港各界的全方位合作。相信在國家『雙循環』格局和『一帶一路』建設的推動下，香港必將為內地企業走向世界提供更強勁的助力，共同在服務國家發展大局中實現新的突破。」

投資署署長劉凱旋表示：「香港作為亞洲領先的國際金融及貿易樞紐，正迅速發展為內地企業實現全球化的首選門戶。一方面，香港擁有無與倫比的連通性，是國際物流樞紐及國際交易中心，擁有自由、開放和規範的營商環境；另一方面，香港具備強大的金融和資本市場、便捷的融資渠道、高透明度的法治環境及專業人才，成為企業部署海外營運和資金管理的最佳據點。與此同時，北部都會區作為香港未來發展的新引擎，透過提供新土地作創新科技發展用途，將為香港注入新經濟動力。」

研討會設有兩場主題討論，邀請內地企業及香港業界代表分享在全球市場中的實戰經驗與策略。

第一場主題討論以「全球變局中跨國供應鏈發展戰略」為主題，由投資署運輸及物流／工業總裁王國藩主持。討論圍繞內地企業在地緣政治、跨國供應鏈重組及科技驅動下的全球營運策略，特別是如何透過香港優勢進行離岸貿易、供應鏈數字化轉型、貿易結算與融資布局，以及利用香港作為國際物流與大宗商品交易平台的策略部署。

August's monthly gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes drops,2025-09-09 19:50,2025-09-09 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900651.htm,"The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (September 9) announced that the monthly gravidtrap index (MGI) for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in August was 5.3 per cent, lower than the 8.1 per cent in July. This reflects the continued efforts by relevant government departments to intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations, resulting in the improvement of the overall mosquito infestation situation this month. In addition, the FEHD has strengthened the dissemination of information on the gravidtrap index for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes so that more citizens can quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation. The department will continue its mosquito control work to further reduce the risk of transmission of chikungunya fever (CF) and dengue fever (DF).

In August, all 64 survey areas recorded an area gravidtrap index (AGI) lower than the alert level of 20 per cent. The decreases in the MGI and the number of surveyareas with an AGI exceeding the alert level in August are attributable to the continuous and intensified mosquito prevention and elimination operations by various government departments and stakeholders, and may also have been affected by factors such as weather. The monthly rainfall was 939.2 millimetres in August, showing a significant increase from the 601.7mm in July and 237.3mm in June. Overall, the MGI for Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in August was 5.3 per cent, at Level 2 (indicating the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in the survey areas was fairly extensive). Relevant departments and stakeholders will persistently intensify mosquito prevention and elimination operations.

Moreover, the monthly density index for Aedes albopictus in August was 1.1, which represented that an average of 1.1 Aedes albopictus adults were found in the Aedes-positive gravidtraps, indicating that the number of adult Aedes albopictus was not abundant in the survey areas.

The FEHD currently makes regular announcements on gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus on its webpage. To allow more citizens to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation, the FEHD has strengthened information dissemination by promptly announcing the latest gravidtrap indexes through press releases and social media.

In addition, to further reduce the risk of transmission of CF, the FEHD has extended the intensified mosquito control work, which was originally activated when the AGI reaches 20 per cent, to cover areas with the AGI falling between 10 and 20 per cent. Specifically, the FEHD will conduct detailed risk assessments in the areas concerned to identify locations with higher mosquito infestation risks, and in collaboration with relevant departments and stakeholders, conduct intensive and targeted mosquito control work. The FEHD will also notify the nearby housing estates, advising property management agents and residents to stay vigilant and join hands in taking mosquito prevention and elimination measures.

To reduce the risk of transmission of CF and DF, the FEHD continues to step up mosquito prevention and control measures across all districts, and to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations within a 250 metre radius of the residence of patients and the places patients had visited during the infectious period, including removing mosquito breeding grounds, applying larvicides to stagnant water that cannot be cleared, and carrying out ultra-low volume fogging operations in adult mosquito habitats such as densely wooded areas, dark and secluded places, and abandoned structures to eliminate adult mosquitoes.

The FEHD continues to conduct its three-phase Anti-mosquito Campaign this year. The third phase of the territory-wide campaign was launched on August 4 and will run until October 24. During the period, the district offices of the FEHD will target areas that have drawn particular concern, such as public markets, cooked food centres and hawker bazaars, single-block buildings, streets and back lanes, common parts of buildings, village houses, construction sites, vacant sites and road works sites, to remove accumulated water and carry out mosquito prevention and control work. To further enhance the effectiveness of mosquito control, the FEHD and relevant government departments have carried out phase two of the All-out Anti-mosquito Operations from May 7. In addition to the work of phase one, including eliminating potential mosquito breeding places, the FEHD called on property management entities to arrange for necessary repairs to their premises to minimise mosquito breeding places and commence adult mosquito control measures by means of regular ultra-low volume fogging operations.

The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

âAedes albopictus is a kind of mosquito that can transmit DF and CF. DF is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, and has become endemic in many countries in Southeast Asia. In 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded over 14 million cases, which was a record number. Additionally, according to the WHO, CF cases have been recorded in more than 110 countries/regions. Many countries worldwide experienced CF outbreaks this year, and as of July, over 240 000 cases had been reported in 16 countries/regions worldwide. The DF and CF activities in neighbouring areas have remained high. Members of the public should stay vigilant and continue to carry out effective mosquito prevention and control measures."
Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for possession of duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo),2025-09-09 19:50,2025-09-09 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900801.htm,"âAn incoming male passenger was sentenced to four weeks' imprisonment and fined $1,200 at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today (September 9) for possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs Officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).

Customs officers intercepted the incoming 83-year-old male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on August 29 and seized 1 781 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $7,000 and a duty potential of about $5,000 from his sling bag and shopping bags. The passenger was subsequently arrested.

Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences. Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
一名入境旅客管有未完稅香煙罪成判囚（附圖）,2025-09-09 19:50,2025-09-09 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900797.htm,"​一名入境男旅客因管有未完稅香煙和未有向海關人員作出申報，違反《應課稅品條例》（《條例》），今日（九月九日）在粉嶺裁判法院被判處監禁四星期及罰款一千二百元。

海關人員於八月二十九日在落馬洲支線管制站截查該名八十三歲抵港男旅客，在其攜帶的斜孭袋及購物袋內檢獲一千七百八十一支未完稅香煙，估計市值約七千元，應課稅值約五千元。該名旅客隨即被捕。

海關對判刑表示歡迎，監禁刑罰具相當阻嚇作用，並反映罪行的嚴重性。海關提醒市民，根據《條例》，煙草屬應課稅品。任何人士若處理、管有、售賣或購買私煙，即屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一百萬元及監禁兩年。

市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑私煙活動。"
八月份白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數回落,2025-09-09 19:50,2025-09-09 20:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900712.htm,"食物環境衞生署（食環署）今日（九月九日）公布，八月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之五點三，較七月份的百分之八點一為低，反映相關政府部門持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，令本月的整體蚊患情況較上月有所改善。此外，食環署已加強白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數的資訊發放，讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，並會繼續進行控蚊工作，進一步降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的傳播風險。

八月份，全部64個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數均低於百分之二十的警戒水平。八月份每月誘蚊器指數及分區誘蚊器指數高於警戒水平的監察地區數目減少，是由於各政府部門及持份者持續加緊採取防蚊及滅蚊行動，亦有機會受天氣等因素影響。八月份的總雨量為939.2毫米，較七月份的601.7毫米及六月份的237.3毫米大幅上升。整體而言，八月份全港白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數為百分之五點三，屬於二級水平（顯示監察地區內白紋伊蚊的分布情況頗為廣泛），各相關部門及持份者仍會持續進行控蚊工作。

另外，八月份白紋伊蚊密度指數為一點一，表示在發現白紋伊蚊的誘蚊器中，白紋伊蚊的平均數量為一點一隻，顯示整體監察地區內的白紋伊蚊成蚊數量並不多。

現時，食環署會定期在部門網頁公布白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數。為讓更多市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，食環署已加強資訊發放，並通過新聞公布及社交媒體盡快發放最新的誘蚊器指數。

此外，為進一步降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險，食環署將原先在分區指數達20%時啓動的強化控蚊工作，擴展至指數介乎10%至20%的區域。具體而言，食環署會在有關區域進行詳細風險評估，找出蚊患情況較高的地點，聯同各部門及持份者進行密集且具針對性的控蚊工作，亦會通知附近的屋苑，建議管理公司和住戶提高警覺，共同採取防蚊滅蚊措施。

為降低基孔肯雅熱及登革熱的傳播風險，食環署繼續在全港各區加強防控蚊患措施，並在病者的住所及於感染期曾到訪的地點250米範圍內進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，包括清除蚊蟲滋生地、於不能清除的積水處施放殺幼蟲劑，以及於成蚊棲息處如樹木茂密、陰暗隱蔽的地點和荒廢結構進行超低微量霧化處理，以殺滅成蚊。

食環署今年繼續分三期進行全港滅蚊運動，第三期滅蚊運動已於八月四日展開，至十月二十四日止。其間，食環署各分區辦事處會針對區內一些受關注的地點，例如公眾街巿、熟食中心、小販巿場、單幢式樓宇、街道和後巷、大廈的公用地方、村屋、建築地盤、空置土地及路旁工地等，進行一連串的清除積水及防治蚊患行動。為進一步加強滅蚊的成效，食環署已聯同相關部門，於五月七日展開第二期全城防蚊及滅蚊行動，除繼續第一期工作，包括清除潛在蚊子滋生地外，食環署呼籲私人物業管理公司及早維修處所，以減少蚊子滋生地，並開始定期以超低微量噴灑方式殺滅成蚊。

食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境以徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

​白紋伊蚊是傳播登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的病媒。登革熱常見於熱帶及亞熱帶地區，在多個東南亞國家，已成為風土病。世界衞生組織（世衞）於二○二四年共錄得超過1 400萬宗登革熱個案，創歷史新高。此外，根據世衞的資料顯示，超過110個國家和地區曾經錄得基孔肯雅熱本土傳播個案。今年全球多國爆發基孔肯雅熱，截至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗個案。鄰近地區登革熱及基孔肯雅熱的活躍程度仍然高企，巿民不應鬆懈，並應繼續採取有效的防治蚊患措施。"

李家超歡迎馮飛書記率領代表團訪港，出席第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」。李家超表示很高興繼三月訪問海南省後，再次與馮飛書記會面。他說，香港與海南地緣相近、人緣相親、商緣相連。兩地政府三月簽署了《海南省人民政府香港特別行政區政府合作備忘錄》，涵蓋經貿投資、金融、數據安全有序流動、旅遊，以及人才交流共五個領域的深度合作，進一步加強瓊港交流合作。

李家超表示，海南與香港同樣位處一帶一路的關鍵節點。今年是海南省迎來自由貿易港封關運作、擴大開放的一年，積極實現自由貿易港高水平開放和高質量發展。瓊港可充分善用合作潛力，共同發揮「一帶一路」功能平台的角色，攜手貢獻「一帶一路」建設。

李家超說，海南省人民政府是首個內地省政府，使用香港的融資平台和專業服務發行債券。他歡迎和感謝海南省人民政府利用香港作為國際金融中心和離岸人民幣債務產品的平台優勢，共同為「一帶一路」建設貢獻力量。香港特別行政區政府會繼續積極發揮橋樑作用，深化瓊港兩地在經貿、旅遊和人才等多方面交流合作，優勢互補，互利共贏，共同為國家高質量發展作出貢獻。

Mr Lee said that Hainan and Hong Kong are both key links under the Belt and Road Initiative. This year marks the customs closure operation and further opening of the Hainan Free Trade Port, actively achieving a high level of opening up and high-quality development. Hong Kong and Hainan can fully leverage their collaborative potential, jointly serving as a functional platform and contributing to the Belt and Road Initiative.

Highlighting that the Hainan Provincial People's Government is the first provincial government of the Mainland to utilise Hong Kong's financing platform and professional services to issue bonds, Mr Lee welcomed and thanked the Hainan Provincial People's Government for leveraging Hong Kong's advantages as an international financial centre and a platform for offshore Renminbi debt products, jointly contributing to the Belt and Road Initiative. The HKSAR Government will continue to actively play its bridging role, deepening exchanges and co-operation between Hong Kong and Hainan in various areas such as economy and trade, tourism, and talent, achieving complementarities and mutual benefits, and contributing to the country's high-quality development.

主席、各位委員：

大家好！行政長官在《2024年施政報告》宣布成立「促進銀髮經濟工作組」（工作組），由我和商務及經濟發展局局長分別擔任組長和副組長，領導統籌各政策局，循五個範疇制定發展方案。五個範疇是：促進「銀色消費」、發展「銀色產業」、推廣「銀色品質保證」、推廣「銀色財務及保障安排」及釋放「銀色生產動力」。

工作組自成立以來，與業界及持份者進行協商，審視了多項建議。在工作組及業界的共同努力下，香港在過去一年逐漸在不同領域開拓了銀色產業和服務。今年五月二十七日，工作組公布推行30項促進銀髮經濟措施。這一系列措施由多個政策局聯同不同界別多個機構共同推動，目標是拉動銀髮族的消費、發展銀色相關的產品和服務、以認證方式增加產品和服務的認受性以拓展銷售、善用和保障長者的財政資源，以及吸引長者投入勞動市場加強社會的生產力。

30項促進銀髮經濟措施的內容及最新進展已載述在文件第4至46段。因此，我不擬重複講述。工作組會繼續留意立法會、業界及組織和不同持份者的意見，以助政府和業界優化措施或探索未來路向。

我和同事樂意聽取委員的意見和回答各位的提問。多謝主席。"

保安局局長在立法會保安事務委員會會議就更生同行--懲教署為在囚人士提供的更生服務開場發言（只有中文）,2025-09-09 17:50,2025-09-09 18:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900708.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（九月九日）出席立法會保安事務委員會會議就更生同行—懲教署為在囚人士提供的更生服務的開場發言︰

主席：

懲教署一直致力確保羈管環境穩妥、安全、人道、合適和健康，同時為在囚人士提供適切的更生服務。懲教署一直肩負「更生同行者」的角色，全面落實各項措施，以多管齊下的方式加強更生工作，包括透過提供全方位的教育和進修機會、與時並進的技能培訓、針對性的心理輔導、行為和思想矯正、適切的更生計劃及就業支援，以及多元化的釋後監管和支援服務，強化在囚人士改過的決心、將更生計劃由圍牆內伸延至圍牆外，同時努力爭取社會各界積極參與和支持更生工作，協助在囚人士改過自新，重投社會。

接下來，我會重點介紹懲教署近年在不同方面的更生工作。

在教育方面，為協助在囚人士創造更多向上流的機會，懲教署在二○二三年十月在白沙灣懲教所和羅湖懲教所設立「立德學院」，為自願參與的成年在囚人士提供一年全日制應用教育文憑課程。

為進一步協助已經考取應用教育文憑的在囚人士獲取進階資歷，懲教署於上年九月在「立德學院」開設通識教育副學士課程，提供兩年全日制遙距課程的升學選擇。懲教署亦同時將「立德學院」擴展至壁屋監獄，為未能在餘下刑期內完成副學士學位的「立德學院」畢業生，提供半日通識教育副學士課程和半日職業訓練，讓他們能夠接受短期升學和職業訓練，協助他們繼續裝備自己，為即將獲釋重投社會做好準備。

在職業訓練方面，懲教署為青少年在囚人士提供13項市場導向的職業訓練課程，以及為將於24個月內獲釋並可合法居留受僱的成年在囚人士，開辦超過40項自願參與的職業訓練課程，提供超過1700個訓練名額。這些課程都由本地培訓機構協辦，並且獲資歷架構或市場認證，有助更生人士就業和報讀銜接或進階課程。

在就業方面，為協助在囚人士獲得更多向上流動的機會，懲教署近年推出「『招』『職』創未來」計劃，為他們提供「一條龍」培訓和工作發展機會，鼓勵他們及早規劃人生，發揮所長，並為社會作出貢獻。計劃內容包括生涯規劃、所內培訓、釋後實習、正式聘請以及師友計劃。

在行為和思想矯正方面，針對因涉及「黑暴」事件和違反《香港國安法》或《維護國家安全條例》的在囚人士的特殊更生需要，懲教署繼續在「沿途有『理』」計劃下，致力按三大更生計劃方向，分別為認識中國歷史和加強國民教育、心理和價值觀重整，以及生涯規劃和家庭關係重修，協助他們重新建立正確的價值觀，積極面對往後人生路上的各種挑戰。

在心理輔導方面，懲教署在上年於羅湖懲教所和豐力樓開展「更生輔助犬服務」，向有需要的在囚人士提供動物輔助治療，改善他們的抑鬱和焦慮情緒，並減低他們的暴力傾向。另外，亦在豐力樓推行的「更生輔助犬服務實習生計劃」，讓中途宿舍受訓生通過照顧更生輔助犬，提升自信心和培養責任感。懲教署還安排受訓生和更生輔助犬到長者服務中心進行關愛探訪服務，藉此回饋社會。

在釋後更生支援方面，懲教署近年新設四間多用途家庭及更生服務中心，進一步加強為更生人士，和他們的家人提供個人和小組輔導服務，以及便利在囚人士家屬進行視像探訪。懲教署亦於去年在屯門和上水兩間多用途家庭及更生服務中心設立家庭治療中心，為正接受法定監管的戒毒者，以及有暴力傾向或思想激進的更生人士舉辦不同類型的治療項目，將在囚期間的心理和家庭輔導服務延伸至社區，協助他們與家人重修關係。

另外，懲教署在去年成立更生服務研究組，目的是通過推動研究工作和參考國際最新的研究結果，開展實證為本的更生服務。

過去20多年，香港的再犯率跌幅非常明顯，由二○○○年的39.9%下降至二○二二年的21.8%，這個得來不易的成果，正正反映懲教署一直以來的堅持和努力、在囚和更生人士改過的決心，以及社會各界對助更新工作的支持。

展望未來，懲教署會繼續因應社會的轉變和需要，積極檢討和加強各項更生服務和計劃，以及與各界攜手，在社區內積極推動更生工作。

根據廣東省疾病預防控制局的資訊，過去一周（八月三十一日至九月六日）廣東省新增178宗基孔肯雅熱個案，較過去兩周分別225宗（八月二十四日至三十日）及336宗（八月十七日至二十三日）進一步減少。全部均為輕症病例，沒有嚴重或死亡個案。雖然廣東省的新增病例數字過去一個月持續遞減，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

本港今年累計錄得13宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-09 17:30,2025-09-09 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900636.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) announced that as of 5pm today (September 9), nonew cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 178 new CF cases in Guangdong during the past week (August 31 to September 6), showing a further decrease compared to the previous two weeks, which reported 225 cases (August 24 to 30) and 336 cases (August 17 to 23) respectively. All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported. Although the number of new CF cases in Guangdong Province has continued to decline over the past month, many countries worldwide are still experiencing CF outbreaks. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 13 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Secretary for Health witnesses signing of collaboration agreements between The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong and three local universities (with photos),2025-09-09 17:25,2025-09-09 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900355.htm,"The Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, today (September 9) attended the signing ceremony of the collaboration agreements between The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) and three local universities with schools of Chinese medicine, namely Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and the University of Hong Kong (HKU). He witnessed CMHHK, as the Chinese medicine (CM) teaching hospital for the respective universities, establish a close partnership with the universities to promote the high-quality and high-standard development of CM in Hong Kong on all fronts.

Professor Lo said, ""Today, CMHHK becomes the CM teaching hospital for the three universities, which marks a significant milestone in the development of CM services, training and education, and scientific research in Hong Kong. I expect CMHHK and the three universities to create synergy in providing better CM services for members of the public, as well as fostering training and education, and scientific research and innovation in CM. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government will continue to give full support to the CMHHK in collaborating with various stakeholders to make good use of the development platform of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and fully leverage Hong Kong's unique advantage of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world, with a view to contributing to the national development of CM.""

The clinical services of CMHHK cover six specialised CM services, namely Internal Medicine in CM, External Medicine in CM, Gynaecology in CM, Paediatrics in CM, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in CM and Acupuncture and Moxibustion in CM. CM experts from the three universities will participate in these services and jointly formulate clinical standards and guidelines, enabling CMHHK to provide quality and safe services for members of the public. Meanwhile, as the CM teaching hospital for the three universities, CMHHK will provide local clinical placements and advanced training opportunities for undergraduates and postgraduates, serving as an important base for nurturing CM talent. In addition, the hospital's diverse clinical cases, coupled with the top-tier research capabilities of the universities, will foster CM scientific research development, including proprietary Chinese medicines development and clinical research. CMHHK will also strengthen co-operation with counterparts on the Mainland and overseas through the international academic networks of the three universities, thereby facilitating CM's going global with concerted effort.

At the signing ceremony, Professor Lo; the President and Vice-Chancellor of HKBU, Professor Alexander Wai (representative of CMHHK); and representatives of the three universities, namely the Vice-President (Research and Development) of HKBU, Professor Lyu Aiping; the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Philip Chiu; and the Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Health) and Dean of the LKS Faculty of Medicine of the HKU, Professor Lau Chak-sing, jointly witnessed the signing of agreements by the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of CMHHK Operator, Mr Wong Kwai-huen, with the Dean of the School of Chinese Medicine of HKBU, Professor Li Min; the Director of the School of Chinese Medicine of the CUHK, Professor Lin Zhixiu; and the Associate Dean (Clinical Affairs) of the LKS Faculty of Medicine of HKU and Director of HKU Health System, Professor Victoria Wong, respectively. The Hospital Chief Executive of CMHHK, Professor Bian Zhaoxiang, also attended the media briefing held after the signing ceremony.

Located at 1 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, CMHHK adopts a public-private partnership model with its construction fully funded by the Government. The Government commissioned HKBU as the Contractor through tendering procedures in 2021. HKBU subsequently incorporated a company limited by guarantee in the same year in accordance with the service deed to act as the operator for managing, operating and maintaining the hospital. CMHHK will commence services in phases starting from December this year."

Quarterly business receipts indices for service industries for second quarter of 2025,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900575.htm,"  Business receipts in value terms of most of the major service industries showed increases of varying magnitudes in the second quarter of 2025 when compared with the second quarter of 2024, according to the provisional figures of business receipts indices released today (September 9) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  Comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the second quarter of 2024, double-digit increases were recorded in business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) (+27.7%), import/export trade (+21.2%), insurance (+20.7%) and banking (+14.5%) industries. On the other hand, the real estate industry recorded a decrease of 8.1% in business receipts index during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 75.6% year-on-year during the same period, while that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain also increased by 9.6% year-on-year.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter comparison, business receipts in value terms of around half of the major service industries recorded increases of varying magnitudes in the second quarter of 2025 when compared with the first quarter of 2025. In particular, business receipts indices of the financing (except banking) and real estate industries increased by 3.5% and 3.0% respectively. On the other hand, business receipts index of the insurance industry decreased by 13.9% during the same period.

  Analysed by service domain, comparing the second quarter of 2025 with the first quarter of 2025 on a seasonally adjusted basis, business receipts index of the computer and information technology services domain increased by 10.0%, whereas that of the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain decreased by 5.6%.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business receipts of most service industries recorded increases in the second quarter of 2025 over a year earlier. More notable increases in business receipts were seen for the financing (except banking), import/export trade, insurance, and banking industries.

  Looking ahead, the continued economic expansion should benefit the business of various service industries. Though some industries may be more affected by external uncertainties, steady economic growth in Asia particularly the Mainland, sustained increases in local employment earnings, together with the Government's various measures to boost the economy and attract investment, would provide support to different service industries.

Further information

  Table 1 presents the business receipts indices and their corresponding year-on-year rates of change in respect of selected service industries and service domains for the recent five quarters, while Table 2 shows the corresponding quarter-to-quarter rates of change in the business receipts indices for the recent five quarters based on the seasonally adjusted series.

  The revised figures of business receipts indices for the second quarter of 2025 will be released at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/web_table.html?id=660-69001) on October 17, 2025.

  Data for compiling the business receipts indices are mainly based on the Quarterly Survey of Service Industries conducted by the C&SD, supplemented by relevant data provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Tourism Board.

  A service domain differs from a service industry in that it comprises those economic activities which straddle different industries but are somehow related to a common theme. It may include all activities carried out by all establishments in a service industry that is closely related to the domain. For a service industry that is less closely related, however, only a portion of the establishments in the industry or even only part of the economic activities of the establishments is related to the domain. Taking the tourism, convention and exhibition services domain as an example, it includes all services of convention and exhibition organisers, short-term accommodation services and services of travel agents, and some of the services (only those involving visitors as customers) of restaurants, retailers and transport operators.

  The classification of service industries follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into relevant industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the report ""Quarterly Business Receipts Indices for Service Industries, Second Quarter 2025"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520).

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for August 2025,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900391.htm,"  The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (September 9) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for August 2025.

  The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased slightly from 42.1 in July 2025 in the contractionary zone to 42.3 in August 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. September 2025) outlook DI on business receipts was 45.7. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts, despite below the 50-mark, rose in August 2025 as compared with previous month for some surveyed sectors, including retail trade (from 39.3 to 41.1) and wholesale trade (from 40.4 to 41.3).

  The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades decreased from 45.0 in July 2025 to 44.2 in August 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. September 2025) was 47.0.

Commentary

  A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs and their outlook in one month's time both improved slightly further in August. The overall employment situation also turned better.

  Looking ahead, local business sentiment would continue to be affected by the uncertain external environment. Nonetheless, solid growth in the local economy, coupled with steady economic growth in Asia in particular the Mainland, should provide support. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.

Further information

  The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to establishments with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent establishments in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled ""Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey"" released by the C&SD.

  The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own establishments rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises"". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300).

二零二五年八月份中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查結果,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900385.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月九日）發表二零二五年八月份中小型企業（中小企）業務狀況按月統計調查的結果。

中小企業務收益的現時動向指數從二零二五年七月在收縮區域的42.1輕微上升至二零二五年八月的42.3，而未來一個月（即二零二五年九月）的業務收益展望動向指數為45.7。按行業分析，業務收益現時動向指數雖低於50的分界線，但一些統計調查涵蓋的行業的相關指數在二零二五年八月較上月上升，包括零售業（從39.3上升至41.1）及批發業（從40.4上升至41.3）。

進出口貿易業新訂單的現時動向指數從二零二五年七月的45.0下跌至二零二五年八月的44.2，而未來一個月（即二零二五年九月）的新訂單展望動向指數為47.0。

評論

政府發言人表示，八月中小企的營商氣氛和對未來一個月的預期均進一步略為改善。整體就業情況亦見好轉。

展望未來，外圍環境不明朗，將繼續影響本地營商氣氛。儘管如此，本地經濟增長穩健，加上亞洲尤其是內地經濟持續穩步增長，應會提供支持。政府會繼續密切監察相關情況。

進一步資料

「中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查」旨在於最短時間內就中小企的短期業務狀況提供快捷的參考。這項統計調查涵蓋的中小企是指就業人數少於50人的機構單位。受訪者在提供意見時已撇除季節性因素的影響。政府統計處根據該統計調查搜集得來的意見，編製了一套動向指數（包括現時與展望動向指數）。指數高於50表示業務情況普遍向好，低於50則表示情況恰恰相反。至於大規模機構單位的業務展望統計，用戶可參考政府統計處發布的刊物《業務展望按季統計調查報告》。

統計調查的結果須小心闡釋。這項統計調查每月約從600間中小企的固定樣本搜集意見，統計調查結果因此受樣本規模所局限。統計調查搜集的意見僅是指受訪者對自己機構單位情況的意見，而非他們對所從事行業情況的意見。此外，就這類有關展望業務狀況的統計調查而言，受訪者的意見會受進行訪問期間社會上各樣事件的影響，並且很難確定受訪者對業務狀況的看法與基本趨勢的相符程度。這項統計調查的大部分數據是在參考月份的最後一周左右搜集。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《中小型企業業務狀況按月統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處的網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

二零二五年第二季服務行業按季業務收益指數,2025-09-09 16:30,2025-09-09 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900414.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月九日）發表的業務收益指數的臨時數字顯示，二零二五年第二季與二零二四年第二季比較，大部分主要服務行業以價值計算的業務收益均有不同程度的升幅。

二零二五年第二季與二零二四年第二季比較，金融業（銀行除外）（+27.7%）、進出口貿易業（+21.2%）、保險業（+20.7%）及銀行業（+14.5%）的業務收益指數均錄得雙位數升幅。另一方面，地產業的業務收益指數同期則下跌8.1%。

按服務界別分析，電腦及資訊科技服務界別的業務收益指數同期按年上升75.6%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別的業務收益指數亦按年上升9.6%。

二零二五年第二季與二零二五年第一季比較，約一半主要服務行業經季節性調整的業務收益（以價值計算）均錄得不同程度的升幅。當中，金融業（銀行除外）及地產業的業務收益指數按季分別上升3.5%和3.0%。另一方面，保險業的業務收益指數同期則下跌13.9%。

按服務界別分析，二零二五年第二季與二零二五年第一季比較，電腦及資訊科技服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數上升10.0%，而旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別經季節性調整的業務收益指數則下跌5.6%。

評論

政府發言人表示，二零二五年第二季大部分服務行業的業務收益較去年同期上升。較顯著的升幅見於金融業（銀行除外）、進出口貿易業、保險業，以及銀行業。

展望未來，經濟持續擴張應會惠及不同服務行業的業務。儘管一些行業或會較受外圍不確定性所影響，但亞洲尤其是內地經濟穩步增長，本地就業收入持續增加，加上政府多項提振經濟和吸引投資的措施，將為不同服務行業提供支持。

進一步資料

表1載列最近五季選定服務行業及服務界別的業務收益指數及其相應按年變動百分率，而表2則載列最近五季經季節性調整的業務收益指數按季變動百分率。

二零二五年第二季的業務收益指數的修訂數字將於二零二五年十月十七日在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/web_table.html?id=660-69001）發布。

編製業務收益指數所用的數據主要來自政府統計處進行的「服務行業按季統計調查」，並輔以香港金融管理局及香港旅遊發展局提供的有關數據。

服務界別有別於服務行業，前者包括橫跨不同行業但與某個共同主題相關的經濟活動。服務界別可能包括某個服務行業內所有機構單位進行的全部經濟活動，而該服務行業與該服務界別關係密切。然而，在一個與該服務界別關係不太密切的服務行業內，只有部分機構單位甚或只有這些機構單位的部分經濟活動是與該服務界別有關。以旅遊、會議及展覽服務界別為例，這界別包括所有會議展覽機構的服務、短期住宿服務及旅行社所提供的服務，以及食肆、零售商及運輸服務營辦商的部分服務（只包括以旅客為對象的服務）。

服務行業的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各類經濟統計調查，把經濟單位分類歸入合適的行業類別。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《二零二五年第二季服務行業按季業務收益指數》報告內。用戶可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080006&scode=520）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

尊敬的李副主任（國務院國有資產監督管理委員會（國資委）副主任李鎮）、各位嘉賓、各位企業家朋友們：

下午好！很高興在這裏與大家齊聚一堂，共同探討內地企業如何利用香港這個獨特的平台，實現全球化的戰略布局。首先，我謹代表香港特區政府，衷心感謝國務院國資委對今天研討會的大力支持，並熱烈歡迎所有遠道而來的內地企業代表和嘉賓朋友們。

習近平主席指出，對外開放是我國的基本國策，我國正在推進高水平對外開放，開放的大門只會越開越大。香港是國家的南大門，在「一國兩制」下，擁有內聯外通、國際化和多元包容的獨特優勢。我們的制度優勢還包括實施普通法；維持自由港地位和自由貿易政策；零關稅和高效的清關手續 、四通八達的物流網絡和港口基建；卓越的金融市場和專業服務等。香港不但是助力內地企業出海的平台，我們蓬勃的金融市場，也能支持內地企業籌募資金發展海外業務。

事實上，我們的優勢獲得國際社會廣泛認同。例如，在瑞士洛桑國際管理發展學院今年發表的《世界競爭力年報》，香港連續兩年上升共四位至全球第三；今年三月的《全球金融中心指數》，香港穩居第三，在亞太稱冠；加拿大菲沙研究所去年也將香港評為全球最自由經濟體。今日剛公布的《2025年世界人才排名》，香港排名全球第四，亞洲第一。

去年，外來駐港公司數量升到9 960家，創下歷史新高，其中來自內地的駐港公司數目最多，佔超過四分之一。

金融服務方面，香港擁有全鏈條的籌融資市場，可為處於不同發展階段的企業提供金融支持。無論是天使投資、風險基金、私募基金、證券市場，還是銀行貸款，香港都能把全球資金跟企業接連起來，全方位多層次支持企業的業務拓展。

特別值得一提的是，香港也是全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，可以為內地企業提供境外人民幣融資，企業也可以把境外人民幣在此進行管理和投資。通過在香港設立財資中心，企業能夠高效地整合和調配全球資金，實現跨境資金池管理、優化流動性配置、降低匯率風險，並提高資金使用效率。香港完善的金融基建、資金自由流動的環境以及與國際接軌的監管體系，為企業海外資金管理提供了安全、便捷、高效的解決方案。

近年來，特區政府積極推動香港發展成為國際創科中心，深化政、產、學、研、投聯動合作。 我們樂見近年不少內地企業在港設立研發中心，推動產品及技術走向全球。事實上，在世界知識產權組織最新發佈的《2025年全球創新指數》中，「深圳—香港—廣州」集群首次位列全球第一，反映粵港澳大灣區的創新能力獲國際高度認可。 香港不僅是大灣區內創新科技產出和加速成長的地方，更為內地科創企業走向全球提供全面的知識產權保護。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，世界百年變局加速演進，近年全球貿易和供應鏈格局重構，為內地企業帶來了挑戰、也創造了機遇。當前內地企業「走出去」到全球南方和「一帶一路」沿線和相關國家，布局供應鏈和產業鏈、並開拓更多元化的市場，已是大勢所趨。因應這大勢，特區政府近年積極推動香港成為服務大家的跨國供應鏈管理中心。特區政府投資推廣署、引進重點企業辦公室和香港貿易發展局（貿發局）建立了機制和專門團隊，聯手助力內地企業來港建立離岸貿易和供應鏈管理的國際和區域總部，為大家提供一站式諮詢服務，協助大家部署環球供應鏈和擴展海外市場。貿發局的海外辦事處亦為內地企業提供在地支援，包括協助企業建立與海外市場的聯繫、了解海外市場法規；提供不同新興國家的市場調查；以及它們在環境、社會和企業管治（ESG）、檢測及認證、出口信用風險管理等方面的資訊。

至今，內地企業通過香港這個平台成功「走出去」的包括來自工程機械界、創意產業界、物流運輸界等。今日多家在港的內地企業代表會跟大家分享他們在香港發展的經驗。

在中央的堅實支持下，我們會竭盡所能支持內地企業出海發展。

歡迎各位積極考慮在香港設立國際業務地區總部、跨國供應鏈管理中心、財資中心、電商中心、知識產權管理中心、科研中心等，讓香港的各種優勢，成就大家的國際化發展。

最後，祝願希望今天的研討會圓滿成功，各位嘉賓朋友事業宏達，身體健康！謝謝大家！"

  The SHYA appointed a supervisory committee on July 18 pursuant to section 72C of the District Councils Ordinance (Cap. 547) to investigate the alleged misconduct of Mr Yip. The supervisory committee submitted a report to the SHYA on September 1. After considering the evidence related to the misconduct, the negative impact of the incident on DC members, DCs and the Government's reputation and credibility, as well as Mr Yip's written representation, the supervisory committee concluded that Mr Yip's dangerous driving conviction constituted misconduct and recommended suspending Mr Yip's functions and duties as a DC member for one week.

  Pursuant to section 72D of the Ordinance and the Performance Monitoring Guidelines for Members of the District Councils, and after considering the report of the supervisory committee, the SHYA concurred with the supervisory committee's opinions that Mr Yip's dangerous driving conviction constituted misconduct, and decided to suspend his functions and duties as a DC member for one week. For the period of suspension, he shall not be entitled to receive any remuneration or allowances, including end-of-service gratuity, but shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the operating expenses incurred, e.g. office rentals and staff salaries, during the period.

  Miss Mak said, ""This is the first time the Government has investigated and imposed sanctions on a DC member for misconduct in accordance with the performance monitoring mechanism for DC members under the improved district governance. The Government places strong emphasis on the conduct and integrity of DC members, and they should conduct themselves in a manner that is in line with public expectations and commensurate with the reputation of the DC and its members. The Government will continue to monitor the performance of DC members to ensure that every DC member upholds their duties to serve the people. The Government would also like to express gratitude to the five members of the supervisory committee for their work and opinions on the case.""

  Mr Yip will be suspended from his functions and duties as a DC member from tomorrow (September 10) to September 16 (both dates inclusive). The DC website has been updated accordingly for public information."

Ambassador Valler (Consul-General of Brazil in Hong Kong, Mr Wladimir Valler Filho), Deputy Commissioner Pan Yundong (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good afternoon.

It's a pleasure to be here, today, in celebration of Brazil's National Day – the 203rd anniversary of its Declaration of Independence. On this special occasion, we honour not only the rich history and culture of Brazil but also the enduring friendship between our peoples.

Brazil is a country of enviable superlatives. The world's fifth-largest nation in area, it's also the seventh-largest in population, with some 213 million people.

As Latin America's largest economy, Brazil has built an impressive and diversified industrial base, with globally competitive companies spanning agriculture, manufacturing, aerospace, metallurgy, services, and more.

I'm pleased to say that Brazil is also our key trading partner in Latin America. Last year, Brazil was Hong Kong's largest import source and second-largest export market in the region. Bilateral merchandise trade between our economies last year reached US$3.4 billion - an increase of more than 18 per cent year on year. These figures speak to the strength and potential of our economic ties.

At a time when protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise globally, Brazil continues to champion multilateralism and international co-operation. It has been a steadfast partner to our country, China, in building a multipolar world and a more sustainable planet. These shared values are more important than ever, as we work together to build a more inclusive and resilient global community. 

Last year marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Brazil, when President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Brazil. It was a milestone celebrated with the signing of over 30 bilateral agreements. And during President Lula da Silva's state visit to our country in May this year, a further 20 co-operation agreements were concluded, covering a wide range of areas including science and technology, digital economy, finance, and more.

This deepening of co-operation between Brazil and China opens up new and exciting avenues for Hong Kong to strengthen its engagement with Brazil. Under the unique ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong serves as a vital bridge between China and the rest of the world. We are well positioned to facilitate and expand bilateral ties across business, trade and innovation.

Hong Kong offers a world-class business environment, underpinned by the rule of law, a free and open economy, and a regulatory regime that is aligned with the best international standards and enriched by a vibrant international and diverse community. These core strengths continue to earn us high recognition in global competitiveness rankings and positive feedback from international businesses operating here.

In trade, our zero-tariff regime, efficient logistics, and seamless customs clearance make Hong Kong an ideal gateway for Brazilian goods entering the Greater Bay Area and the broader Chinese and Asian markets. 

One area of particular promise for future collaboration is innovation and technology. Brazil leads Latin America in the number and diversity of its start-ups, reflecting a dynamic and entrepreneurial spirit. Likewise, Hong Kong is emerging as a leading I&T hub, bolstered by the strength of the Greater Bay Area, which hosted an innovation cluster that tops the world in a recent ranking by the World Intellectual Property Organization.

We are actively attracting global talent, companies and start-ups to join our thriving innovation ecosystem, with nearly 30 per cent of start-up founders coming from outside Hong Kong.

It helps that Hong Kong is Asia's leading financial centre, offering a full range of funding options, with deep liquidity, exceptional professional services, and unparalleled international connectivity. For start-ups and innovators, launching here is effectively an international seal of approval. If a start-up can thrive in Hong Kong, it is likely to succeed elsewhere.

Of course, our growing ties are not limited to business alone. We welcome Brazilian music, dance, food and drink, entertainment and, yes, football, too. I had the pleasure of enjoying a taste of Brazilian culture in June, at the opening ceremony of ""Extravaganza! When Brazil Meets Hong Kong"", down by the harbour. It was a joyful and colourful celebration that added vibrancy to Hong Kong's calendar as Asia's events capital.

I am delighted to hear that Brazil's ""Extravaganza"" will return to Hong Kong next year, and I look forward to even more cultural exchanges that bring our communities closer together.

On this note, I wish you a happy national day. Thank you very much."

EDB announces Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors for 2026/27 cohort - undergraduate programmes,2025-09-09 14:30,2025-09-09 14:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900348.htm,"âThe Education Bureau (EDB) announced today (September 9) that the Study Subsidy Scheme for Designated Professions/Sectors (SSSDP) will subsidise a total of 4 781 places in 57 undergraduate programmes, covering 3 425 places in 57 first-year-first-degree (FYFD) programmes and 1 356 places in 45 top-up degree (TUD) programmes of eight post-secondary institutions for the cohort to be admitted in the 2026/27 academic year.

The programmes of the SSSDP fall under 10 disciplines that have been identified as having keen manpower demand, namely architecture and engineering, computer science, creative industries, financial technology, healthcare, insurance, logistics, sports and recreation, testing and certification, and tourism and hospitality. The programmes include 16 applied degree programmes, which will receive additional subsidies, with a view to further strengthening the vocational and professional education and training progression pathway at the post-secondary level.

The programmes and numbers of subsidised places under the SSSDP are determined by the EDB in consultation with relevant policy bureaux and departments. Details of the participating institutions, the programmes and the numbers of subsidised places are listed in the Annex. The EDB will continue to work with relevant policy bureaux and departments to explore covering more suitable programmes in the SSSDP.

The annual subsidy amounts for the 2026/27 academic year will remain unchanged at $81,450 for laboratory-based programmes and $46,780 for non-laboratory-based programmes. For applied degree programmes, including the additional annual subsidies, the total annual subsidy amounts will also remain unchanged at $89,620 for laboratory-based programmes and $51,880 for non-laboratory-based programmes.

The subsidy amounts are applicable to both new and continuing eligible students. The subsidy is tenable for the normal duration of the programmes concerned. Subsidised students will pay a tuition fee with the subsidy applied. Students in need may still apply for student financial assistance from the Student Finance Office of the Working Family and Student Financial Assistance Agency in respect of the actual amount of tuition fee payable.

The subsidised FYFD intake places are allocated mainly through the Joint University Programmes Admissions System to ensure that eligible students are selected on a merit basis, whereas the subsidised places of the TUD programmes are allocated in accordance with the existing admission arrangements of the self-financing TUD programmes, i.e. through direct admission by institutions. Students can apply for admission to the programmes directly through the institutions concerned.

The SSSDP was launched in the 2015/16 academic year to subsidise students to pursue designated full-time locally accredited self-financing undergraduate programmes in selected disciplines. The objectives are as follows:

(1) to increase the supply of subsidised undergraduate places by leveraging the supply of the self-financing post-secondary education sector;

(2) to nurture talent in support of specific industries with keen demand for human resources;

(3) to encourage the self-financing post-secondary education sector to offer programmes in selected disciplines that meet Hong Kong's social and economic needs by providing targeted financial support; and

(4) to support the healthy and sustainable development of the self-financing post-secondary education sector to complement the University Grants Committee-funded sector in broadening and diversifying study opportunities.

The SSSDP has been expanded to include TUD programmes with effect from the 2023/24 academic year. As for the designated sub-degree programmes, the relevant details for the 2026/27 cohort, including the participating institutions, the sub-degree programmes, the numbers of subsidised places and the subsidy amounts, will be announced in due course.

Details of the SSSDP are available on the EDB website (www.cspe.edu.hk/sssdp)."
Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier opens today (with photo),2025-09-09 14:15,2025-09-09 14:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900292.htm,"Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier is open for public use today (September 9), providing two berths to divert vessel and passenger traffic from the existing Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier and the nearby landing steps, thereby alleviating congestion, especially during holidays.

The new pier, a project under the Pier Improvement Programme (PIP), is located next to Ma Liu Shui Landing No. 3 on Science Park Road in Sha Tin (see location map). It provides berths for local sightseeing vessels and kaito ferries for passenger boarding and alighting. Two regular kaito ferry service routes, namely Ma Liu Shui - Lai Chi Wo and Ma Liu Shui - Kat O/Ap Chau, currently using Landing No. 3 for boarding and alighting, will switch to the new pier starting this Saturday (September 13). The other two regular kaito ferry service routes, Ma Liu Shui - Tap Mun and Ma Liu Shui - Tung Ping Chau, will continue to use Ma Liu Shui Ferry Pier.

The new pier features a design with a floating platform and a gangway. As the floating platform rises and falls with the sea level, it remains at the same level as the vessels, making it easier for them to berth and for passengers to board and alight safely and conveniently. The floating platform is connected to the shore by a gangway for passengers in need. In addition, facilities including charging stations, a Wi-Fi hotspot and an information display panel are installed on the shore to enhance user convenience and experience.

Launched in 2017, the PIP aims to improve marine traffic to and from remote areas in the New Territories and outlying islands, facilitating access for residents and visitors while meeting the needs of fishermen's operations through reconstruction or construction of public piers and upgrading of pier facilities. The PIP currently involves 23 public piers. In addition to Ma Liu Shui New Ferry Pier, which is open today, Pak Kok Pier on Lamma Island and Kau Sai Village Pier in Sai Kung are already open for public use. Ten piers are under construction, seven of which will open progressively by the end of 2025. These include Lai Chi Chong Pier, Sham Chung Pier and Sam Mun Tsai Village Pier in Tai Po District; Leung Shuen Wan Pier in Sai Kung District; Yi O Pier and Ma Wan Chung Pier on Lantau; and Shek Tsai Wan Pier at Ma Wan. Improvement works for Yung Shue Wan Public Pier on Lamma Island, Sai Wan Jetty on Cheung Chau and Tai O Public Pier on Lantau are expected to be completed in 2026. The remaining piers are at the planning and design stages, and the projects will be taken forward in an orderly manner."

新碼頭是「改善碼頭計劃」下的項目，位於沙田科學園路馬料水三號梯台旁（見位置圖），供本地觀光船隻和街渡渡輪停泊上落客。現時利用三號梯台上落客的兩條固定班次街渡渡輪服務航線：馬料水—荔枝窩和馬料水—吉澳／鴨洲，本周六（九月十三日）起將改用新碼頭上落客；而馬料水—塔門和馬料水—東平洲兩條固定班次街渡渡輪服務航線將繼續使用馬料水渡輪碼頭上落客。

新碼頭採用浮動平台及斜台設計。由於浮動平台會隨海面升降，能與船隻保持在同一水平，方便船隻靠泊，乘客上落船隻亦更加安全和便捷；浮動平台以斜台連接到岸上，供有需要乘客使用。此外，岸上配備充電設施、Wi-Fi熱點及電子顯示屏等，方便使用者及豐富其體驗。

政府於二○一七年推出「改善碼頭計劃」，透過重建或增建公共碼頭，以及提升碼頭設施，改善新界及離島偏遠地方的對外海上交通，方便居民和遊客出行及滿足漁民作業需要。計劃現時涵蓋二十三個公眾碼頭，除了今日開放的馬料水新渡輪碼頭，南丫島北角碼頭及西貢滘西村碼頭已經啓用；十個碼頭正在興建中，當中七個將於二○二五年年底前陸續啓用，分別為大埔區荔枝莊碼頭、深涌碼頭及三門仔村碼頭、西貢區糧船灣碼頭、大嶼山二澳碼頭及馬灣涌碼頭，以及馬灣石仔灣碼頭；而南丫島榕樹灣公眾碼頭、長洲西灣碼頭及大嶼山大澳公眾碼頭的改善工程則預計於二○二六年完成；其餘碼頭正在規劃及設計階段，會適時有序地推展。"

香港特區政府與貿易發展局主辦的第十屆「一帶一路高峰論壇」，將於本周三、四（九月十至十一日）在香港舉行。論壇匯聚多國政商界領袖，共同探討商機，是深化香港與「一帶一路」沿線國家和地區經貿聯繫的重要平台。適逢高峰論壇即將舉行，立法會秘書處（秘書處）今日（九月九日）發布最新一期《專題快訊》――「拓展全球經貿網絡」。

《專題快訊》概述香港在國家《十四五規劃》的支持下，發揮國際貿易中心角色的最新情況，包括香港在經貿方面的獨特優勢，以及如何發揮「超級連繫人」及「超級增值人」的角色，持續拓展經貿網絡，並綜述立法會相關討論。

《專題快訊》指出，香港憑藉自由貿易政策、世界級基礎設施、普通法制度和健全法治，以及「一國兩制」的制度優勢這四項「成功基因」，成為全球最具競爭力的貿易中心之一，香港特區政府亦一直多管齊下拓展全球經貿網絡。

《專題快訊》指出，香港積極擴展貿易及投資協定，與二十一個經濟體簽訂了自由貿易協定，以及與三十三個經濟體簽訂了促進和保護投資協定，與卡塔爾的投資協定談判亦大致完成。立法會議員建議政府尋求與更多經濟體，特別是東盟和中東新興市場，商定自貿和投資協定，以及協助港商開拓拉丁美洲市場。

《專題快訊》亦介紹，特區政府積極爭取加入全球規模最大的自貿協定《區域全面經濟伙伴關係協定》（RCEP），以減少國際貿易成本和貿易壁壘，並指出香港加入RCEP後，將深化成員間的貿易往來，協助它們參與「一帶一路」倡議，助力進入內地市場。立法會亦積極爭取多方支持香港盡早加入RCEP，包括在立法會主席率領下先後到東盟三國（即馬來西亞、印尼和新加坡）及日本進行職務考察，並接待了多國的駐港總領事和國會議員，向他們解說香港加入RCEP有助促進互惠共贏。議員又建議政府規劃北部都會區時，重點推動可受惠於RCEP的相關配套產業。

《專題快訊》亦臚列特區政府多項招商引資的工作，包括致力構建跨國供應鏈管理中心，吸引內地企業來港設立管理離岸貿易和供應鏈的國際或區域總部，協助內地企業「走出去」；透過《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》（CEPA），加大開拓內地貨物及服務貿易，增強香港對海外投資者的吸引力，同時讓香港成為內地企業「走出去」的最佳跳板，而去年簽訂的CEPA《服務貿易協議》的第二份修訂協議，讓香港的服務提供者更容易在內地設立企業和發展業務。

《專題快訊》指出，「一帶一路」倡議是格局宏大的國家長遠發展策略，香港憑藉獨特優勢成為共建「一帶一路」的首選功能平台，而特區政府積極拓展沿線新興巿場，近年重點工作包括行政長官訪問中東，加強與當地的經貿聯繫，擴展全球各地特別是新興市場的辦事處網絡，以及優化「BUD專項基金」，協助企業拓展境外市場。

《專題快訊》綜述議員對拓展全球經貿網絡的多項建議，包括建議當局全面統籌和加強招商引資工作，檢視和優化相關部門和公營機構的分工及職能，避免資源重疊；建立健全產業鏈和供應鏈，協助企業「引進來、走出去」；在更多領域訂立及推廣粵港澳大灣區標準，以便利港商利用CEPA的優惠措施進入內地市場；推動本地航空公司開辦更多來往香港與中東城市的國際航線，以便利經商旅遊，以及吸引「一帶一路」沿線國家企業和家族辦公室來港開設或擴展業務。

財經事務及庫務局局長在蘇州（香港）金融合作交流會致辭全文（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-09-09 13:00,2025-09-09 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/09/P2025090900396.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（九月九日）在蘇州（香港）金融合作交流會的致辭全文：

尊敬的林太（香港特別行政區第五任行政長官、江蘇省海外聯誼會名譽會長、江蘇省香港商會永遠榮譽會長林鄭月娥）、馬省長（江蘇省常務副省長馬欣）、顧市長（蘇州市常務副市長顧海東）、彩霞巡視員（國家金融監督管理總局國際合作司一級巡視員王彩霞）、各位重要嘉賓、金融業界朋友：

大家好。歡迎馬省長和顧市長帶領各位蘇州市的同事來到香港。很高興今天出席蘇州金融合作交流推介會，與各位就促進蘇州和香港金融合作交流，並見證《香港──蘇州金融協同發展行動方案》的簽署。

香港是蘇州市主要外資來源地。去年蘇州實際使用港資接近30億美元，佔全市實際使用外資額約百分之五十七。今年蘇州市政府工作報告強調要提升蘇州對外開放水平，主動擁抱全球化，着力打造雙向開放的國際門戶城市。在此基礎上，我認為香港作為「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」，正好可發揮作為國際金融中心的優勢，透過加強香港蘇州兩地的金融合作，達致互利共贏。合作方向我這裏也拋磚引玉提出四個可行的範疇。

第一，善用香港作為聯通內地與世界各地的「超級聯繫人」角色，助力蘇州企業拓展國際業務。香港擁有國際級一流的專業服務和豐富的國際交流合作經驗，是蘇州企業「走出去」，拓展「一帶一路」及海外市場的首選平台。無論是為大型基建項目融資、設立企業的離岸財資中心，還是設立專屬自保保險公司等，香港都能提供全面的專業服務，充分發揮既了解內地企業需求，又與國際市場接軌的優勢。

第二，深化資本市場聯通。在上市融資方面，香港一直擔當內地企業集資平台的角色。截至今年七月底，在香港上市的內地企業共有1 511家，當中有五家市值合共約900多億港元的蘇州企業。我們歡迎更多蘇州企業善用香港作為籌融資平台，包括透過香港交易所（香港交易及結算所有限公司）於前年推出的特專科技上市新章節上市融資。

第三，支持數字金融和金融科技創新。科技自立自強是國家強盛之基、安全之要，科技創新已經成為提高綜合國力的關鍵支撐。在金融領域，香港目前共有超過1 100家金融科技公司，涵蓋移動支付、跨境理財、人工智能金融服務顧問、財富及投資管理、合規科技等範疇。蘇州香港兩地金融機構和企業可以加強在金融科技技術研發和應用方面的合作。

第四，推動綠色金融發展。綠色金融對推動經濟社會可持續發展、實現雙碳目標有重要意義。香港可以進一步發揮國際金融中心的優勢，引導境外資金支持國家綠色和可持續發展。我們也知道今年剛好是「兩山」理念的二十周年慶典，所以這個綠色金融發展正好是非常好的時機，我們期待香港和蘇州加強綠色金融方面的交流合作，也歡迎蘇州政府和企業善用香港進行綠色融資，包括發行綠色債券。

女士們先生們，今日《香港──蘇州金融協同發展行動方案》的簽署，正好體現了剛才我提及的四大合作範疇。我期待未來與蘇州市政府進一步加強合作交流，實現互惠共贏，共同為國家金融高質量發展作出積極貢獻。謝謝。"
