CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as severe paediatric influenza infection case was recorded over two consecutive days,2025-10-21 21:14,2025-10-21 21:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100859.htm,"Following yesterday's (October 20) announcement ofa case of severe paediatric influenza A infection, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 21) recorded another severe case.The CHP reiterated its appeal to schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 2-year-old girl with underlyingillness. She has developed a fever, cough and shortness of breathsince October 10. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospitalon October 16 and was admitted for treatment. She is currently in critical condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A(H1)virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia.

The girl had not received the 2025/26 SIV yet. Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic and no influenza outbreaks have been reported at her school recently.

  ""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illnessoutbreaks in schools since September. As of October 21, 587 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 62 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 315 cases in primary schools and 210 cases in secondary schools. Including the above case, 12 severe paediatric influenza cases, including one fatal case, involving children aged 2 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year. Nine of them had good past health,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

  ""Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to the Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions,"" he added.

The 2025/26 SIV Programmes have commenced, offering free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes. This year, all schools may choose to use the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV nasal vaccines) and ""hybrid mode"", i.e. schools are allowed to choose both injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and LAIV for the same or different outreach vaccination activities.

The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged 6 months to under 2 years. Moreover, the District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission in the 18 districts, and 74 Family Medicine Clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For a list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccinations at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system.

Dr Tsui reminded high-risk individuals to wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.

連續兩日錄得兒童感染流感的嚴重個案　衞生防護中心呼籲學童盡快接種季節性流感疫苗,2025-10-21 20:30,2025-10-21 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100828.htm,"繼昨日（十月二十日）公布一宗兒童感染甲型流感的嚴重個案，衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（十月二十一日）再接獲另一宗嚴重個案。中心再次呼籲學校和家長盡快安排學童和子女免費接種季節性流感疫苗，因為接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。

個案涉及一名有長期病患的兩歲女童。她十月十日開始出現發燒、咳嗽和氣促，十月十六日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫，需留院治理，目前情況危殆。她的鼻咽拭子樣本經化驗後，證實對甲型流感（H1）呈陽性反應，臨床診斷為甲型流感併發嚴重肺炎。

女童尚未接種二○二五／二六季度流感疫苗。她的家居接觸者暫時沒有病徵，她就讀的學校近日亦沒有出現流感爆發的情況。

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港正值夏季流感季節，學校的流感樣疾病爆發個案自九月起大幅上升。截至十月二十一日，九月開學後涉及學校的爆發個案共有587宗，包括幼稚園／幼兒中心（62宗）、小學（315宗）及中學（210宗）。計及上述個案，中心由開學至今錄得十二宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，當中包括一宗死亡個案，年齡介乎2至17歲，其中九人過往的健康狀況良好。」

他續說：「市民如出現發燒及呼吸道病徵，尤是兒童、長者及有長期病患人士，應盡快求醫，以及早接受治療。兒童患上流感，情況可能迅速惡化，家長必須注意患病兒童的身體狀況，一旦發現病童情況轉差，例如出現呼吸急促、喘鳴、咀唇發紫、胸痛、神智模糊、持續發燒或抽搐等，必須立即前往急症室求醫。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃已經展開，為合資格的高風險群組透過各項疫苗注射計劃免費或獲資助接種季節性流感疫苗。今年所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗以及「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。

此外，政府亦已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有6個月至2歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間家庭醫學診所和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。

徐樂堅醫生提醒高危人士到人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。任何人士出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩及盡早向醫生求診，同時考慮應否上班或上學。

有關最新的流感資訊，市民可參閱衞生防護中心流感網頁及2019冠狀病毒病及流感速遞。"

Deputy Director Luo Yonggang (Deputy Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Acting CommissionerLi Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region), Dr Raymond Chan (Chair of the Shaw Prize Foundation), Professor Kenneth Young (Chair of the Shaw Prize Council), Professor Reinhard Genzel (Chair of the Board of Adjudicators of the Shaw Prize Foundation), esteemed laureates, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good evening. I am delighted to be here, with you, on this splendid occasion – the Shaw Prize Award Presentation Ceremony. A celebration of the achievements by our remarkable scientists.

  Generations after generations, we stand on the shoulders of giants to gaze upon the future of science, consolidating, building on, and often breaking through the foundations built by them.

  As we gather to celebrate new achievements on this journey, we must also pay tribute to trailblazers who came before us. It is in this spirit of reverence, and continuity, that we remember and honour a monumental figure for the Shaw Prize, the scientific community and, indeed, humanity – Professor Chen-ning Yang.

  A founding member of the Shaw Prize Council and the Chair of its Board of Adjudicators for over a decade, Professor Yang was instrumental in establishing the very standards of excellence we recognise today. As one of the first Chinese scientists to receive a Nobel Prize in Physics, he reshaped modern physics, and remained devoted to the scientific and educational developments of China, our country.

  Professor Yang's spirit of intellectual pursuit, and his unwavering dedication to advancing knowledge for humanity, continue to live on today.

  This commitment to excellence brings us here tonight – some 600 strong from around the world – to honour this year's Shaw Laureates. Here to pay tribute to their pioneering advances in three discrete disciplines: astronomy, life science and medicine, and mathematical sciences.

  My congratulations to each of you for your outstanding, and continuing, contributions to science and to civilisation – to a future bright with co-operation, progress and purpose.

  That, of course, speaks of the vision Sir Run Run Shaw brought to compelling life – with the help of Professor Yang and other founding members – one that celebrates education and the pursuit of knowledge through science and research.

  That vision is central to the priorities and policies of the HKSAR Government. We dedicate significant investments to innovation and technology, and the research and development that drives it.

  That same commitment shapes our post-secondary education. I'm proud to say that Hong Kong is home to five of the world's top 100 universities. And, in the 2026 World University Rankings, announced earlier this month, Hong Kong claimed a record six spots in the top 200.

  Indeed, this year, for the first time, all eight of our publicly funded universities made the World University Rankings.

  And in this year's World Talent Ranking, Hong Kong finished fourth overall, topping the world in the category of ""graduates in sciences"".

  Hong Kong's outstanding institutions nurture our talented and hard-working young generation. They also help to attract some of the world's best academics and professionals to our city. Just this month, we welcomed a Nobel Laureate in Physics to one of our universities. We are thankful to many science laureates, as well as world-class academics and researchers in our city, and I'm confident that they will continue to propel Hong Kong's rise as an international education and I&T hub.

  The Hong Kong Government will continue to work closely with the Shaw Prize, our homegrown scientific award of international repute, in realising the potential of science, and in contributing to a world that prizes collaboration, harmony and a future of promise and innovation for all.

  My congratulations to all laureates again. I wish you a memorable evening in Hong Kong – Asia's world city. Asia's science city.

  Thank you."

A Hong Kong Pavilion themed ""Hong Kong is So Chic"" was set up, which showcased an array of exquisite design works and creative lifestyle representations. Through hosting a series of activities, it also enhanced the industry's exposure on the Chinese Mainland, fostering opportunities for market expansion and collaboration. The Hong Kong Pavilion was well received by visitors, with over 50 000 attendees recorded during the four-day expo period, reflecting the appeal of Hong Kong's cultural and creative forces.

  The design of the Hong Kong Pavilion focused on Hong Kong's vibrant cityscape, charaterised by the organised chaos from the city's narrow lanes and alleys, imparting an ambience of serenity. It showcased works from renowned Hong Kong brands and creators alongside creations from emerging designers and brands. Their designs represented the East-meets-West cultural fusion of Hong Kong, highlighting the diversity and unique charm of the city's cultural contours.

The Hong Kong Pavilion comprised the Art Toy Zone, the Fashion and Apparel Zone, the Hong Kong Brands Zone, and the Film and Comics Zone, exhibiting films, comics, art toys, fashion, jewellery, and lifestyle products from 13 local designers and brands, with an aim of showcasing the latest achievements in Hong Kong's cultural and creative industries.

As pledged in ""The Chief Executive's 2025 Policy Address"", CCIDA proactively assists Hong Kong cultural and creative designers in producing more cultural and creative products with Chinese and Hong Kong cultural features, and will continue to strengthen support for local original works to enter the Mainland and international markets."
反非法勞工行動拘十人（附圖）,2025-10-21 19:01,2025-10-21 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100745.htm,"入境事務處（入境處）於十月二十日至今日（十月二十一日）一連兩日在東涌區一個新入伙的大型屋苑展開代號為「促進行動」的反非法勞工行動，以打擊從事裝修工作的非法勞工。

入境處調查人員較早前留意到有內地裝修公司透過網上社交平台，以相對便宜的價錢作招倈，提供一站式的裝修工程服務。同時，有不法分子會聘請非法勞工來港進行裝修工作，以減低服務成本，從中獲利。

入境處隨即針對新入伙的大型屋苑展開行動，一共搜查超過一百五十個目標住宅及處所，拘捕七名懷疑非法勞工及三名涉嫌聘用非法勞工的僱主。被捕的懷疑非法勞工為七名男子，年齡介乎三十六至五十四歲。因涉嫌聘用非法勞工被捕的僱主則為兩男一女，年齡介乎四十三至五十四歲。有關涉嫌聘用上述非法勞工的僱主的調查仍然在進行中，不排除有更多人被捕。

同時，入境處職員亦安排宣傳車及派員於屋苑內向住戶及物業管理人員派發「切勿聘用非法員工」的宣傳單張，呼籲切勿聘用非法勞工。

入境處發言人說：「任何人違反對他／她有效的逗留條件，即屬犯罪。同時，所有旅客在未獲入境處處長批准前，無論受薪與否，均不得在港從事任何僱傭工作。違例者會遭檢控，一經定罪，最高刑罰為罰款五萬元及監禁兩年。協助及教唆者同罪。」

發言人重申，僱用不可合法受僱的人是嚴重罪行。根據《入境條例》，僱主若僱用不可合法受僱的人，而該人是非法入境者、受遣送離境令或遞解離境令規限的人、逾期逗留或被拒入境人士，最高刑罰由原來的罰款三十五萬元及監禁三年，大幅提高至罰款五十萬元和監禁十年，以反映有關罪行的嚴重性。而有關公司的董事、經理、秘書、合夥人等，亦可能需負上刑事責任。高等法院曾頒布判刑指引，聘用非法勞工的僱主須被判即時入獄。

根據法院判例，任何人士在決定聘用一名僱員前，必須採取一切切實可行的步驟以確定有關僱員是可合法受僱。除了查閱僱員的身份證外，該人亦負有明確的責任向僱員作出查詢，而僱員提供的任何答案不會令該人對僱用有關僱員的合法性產生合理懷疑，否則法院不會接納以此作為免責辯護。如求職者沒有香港永久性居民身份證，僱主亦必須查閱求職者的有效旅行證件，違例者經定罪後，最高可被判罰款十五萬元及監禁一年。就此，發言人提醒所有僱主切勿以身試法，僱用非法勞工。入境處會繼續嚴正執法，打擊有關罪行。

入境處會根據現行機制的標準程序以審核及識別販運人口受害人，對所有行動中被捕的容易受剝削人士（包括非法勞工、非法入境者、性工作者及外籍家庭傭工）進行初步審核。如初步審核結果顯示有任何販運人口指標出現，入境處人員會依據一份標準核對清單再作全面調查及識別程序，以確定當中是否有販運人口的元素，例如在招募階段是否涉及威脅及脅迫，以及是否存有剝削性質。被識別的販運人口受害人會獲提供各項支援和協助，包括緊急介入、診症和治療、輔導、收容或臨時住宿及其他支援服務。入境處呼籲販運人口受害人應立即向有關部門舉報有關罪行。

市民可使用舉報非法勞工專線3861 5000、傳真2824 1166、電郵anti_crime@immd.gov.hk、或登入入境處網址www.immd.gov.hk利用「網上舉報違反入境條例罪行」表格向入境處舉報僱用非法勞工活動。"
10 persons arrested during anti-illegal worker operation (with photos) ,2025-10-21 19:01,2025-10-21 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100747.htm,"  The Immigration Department (ImmD) mounted an anti-illegal worker operation at a newly built/inhabited housing estate at Tung Chung District codenamed ""Contribute"" for two consecutive days on October 20 and today (October 21) to combat the influx of illegal renovation workers.

  ImmD investigators recently noticed that some Mainland renovation companies were using online social media platforms to offer one-stop renovation services at a lower price. Meanwhile, some offenders might attempt to reduce their service costs and gain profit from hiring illegal workers to conduct renovation works in Hong Kong.

  ImmD immediately conducted an operation at a newly built/inhabited housing estate. Immigration officers raided over 150 target locations. A total of seven suspected illegal workers and three suspected employers were arrested. The arrested suspected illegal workers comprised seven men, aged 36 to 54. Two men and a woman, aged 43 to 54, suspected of employing the illegal workers, were also arrested. Investigations into the suspected employers are ongoing, and the possibility of further arrests is not ruled out.

  At the same time, ImmD officers and a promotional vehicle have been deployed to distribute ""Don't Employ Illegal Workers"" leaflets and convey the message to occupants and property management staff in housing estates.

  An ImmD spokesman said, ""Any person who contravenes a condition of stay in force in respect of him or her shall be guilty of an offence. Also, visitors are not allowed to take employment in Hong Kong, whether paid or unpaid, without the permission of the Director of Immigration. Offenders are liable to prosecution and upon conviction face a maximum fine of $50,000 and up to two years' imprisonment. Aiders and abettors are also liable to prosecution and penalties.""

  The spokesman reiterated that it is a serious offence to employ people who are not lawfully employable. Under the Immigration Ordinance, the maximum penalty for an employer employing a person who is not lawfully employable, i.e. an illegal immigrant, a person who is the subject of a removal order or a deportation order, an overstayer or a person who was refused permission to land, has been significantly increased from a fine of $350,000 and three years' imprisonment to a fine of $500,000 and 10 years' imprisonment to reflect the gravity of such offences. The director, manager, secretary, partner, etc, of the company concerned may also bear criminal liability. The High Court has laid down sentencing guidelines that the employer of an illegal worker should be given an immediate custodial sentence.

  According to the court sentencing, employers must take all practicable steps to determine whether a person is lawfully employable prior to employment. Apart from inspecting a prospective employee's identity card, the employer has the explicit duty to make enquiries regarding the person and ensure that the answers would not cast any reasonable doubt concerning the lawful employability of the person. The court will not accept failure to do so as a defence in proceedings. It is also an offence if an employer fails to inspect the job seeker's valid travel document if the job seeker does not have a Hong Kong permanent identity card. Offenders are liable upon conviction to a maximum fine of $150,000 and to imprisonment for one year. In that connection, the spokesman would like to remind all employers not to defy the law by employing illegal workers. The ImmD will continue to take resolute enforcement action to combat such offences.

  Under the existing mechanism, the ImmD will, as a standard procedure, conduct an initial screening of vulnerable persons, including illegal workers, illegal immigrants, sex workers and foreign domestic helpers, who are arrested during any operation with a view to ascertaining whether they are trafficking in persons (TIP) victims. When any TIP indicator is revealed in the initial screening, the ImmD officers will conduct a full debriefing and identification by using a standardised checklist to ascertain the presence of TIP elements, such as threats and coercion in the recruitment phase and the nature of exploitation.

"FS attends APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting in Incheon, Korea (with photos)",2025-10-21 18:53,2025-10-21 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100723.htm,"The Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Finance Ministers' Meeting in Incheon, Korea, today (October 21), and met with the Chair of the Meeting, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Korea, Mr Koo Yun-cheol.

This year's meeting focused on key issues including global and regional economic situations and outlooks, digital finance, and fiscal policies of member economies.

Mr Chan spoke at various sessions of the meeting. During the session on the global and regional economic outlooks, he remarked that global growth momentum has weakened amid rising challenges from unilateralism and tariffs. He stressed that the global economy is facing heightened uncertainty, with some economies having to choose between co-operation and coercion, as well as between shared prosperity and narrow self-interest. Against this backdrop, Hong Kong, China remains firmly committed to upholding a free and open trade and investment environment, providing global enterprises and investors with a stable, consistent and predictable business environment. He called on all member economies to safeguard a rules-based multilateral trading system and to work together in promoting sustainable regional economic growth.

At the session on digital finance, Mr Chan highlighted that blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly advancing digital financial services. These technologies not only improve efficiency and reduce costs, but also play a key role in driving financial inclusion. Drawing on Hong Kong, China's experience, he shared three key observations on developing a robust fintech ecosystem. First, financial innovation should serve the real economy. Strengthening data connectivity through public-private partnerships is essential to promoting inclusive and accessible financial services. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched the Commercial Data Interchange (CDI), a platform that enables small and medium-sized enterprises to share business data with banks to facilitate credit assessment. To date, the CDI has supported over 60 000 loan applications with loans granted exceeding US$6.5 billion. Second, regulators should encourage innovation to drive market developments while maintaining effective oversight. Hong Kong's financial regulatory bodies offer regulatory sandboxes that allow financial institutions and tech companies to test innovative fintech solutions, with feedback from regulators to help refine and improve these solutions before full-scale implementation. Third, in light of the increasingly widespread application of digital assets and AI in financial services, economies should place strong emphasis on ensuring that such innovations are responsible and sustainable - including the need to safeguard investor interests and maintain financial stability. Mr Chan stated that Hong Kong is actively engaged in cross-border co-operation and policy dialogue on digital finance, and stands ready to deepen collaboration with regional partners in these areas.

At the session on fiscal policy, Mr Chan shared Hong Kong, China's economic strategy, which includes solidifying its strengths as an international financial and trading centre, while fostering growth of emerging industries such as innovation and technology. He also outlined the Government's fiscal consolidation plan, which focuses primarily on containing expenditure growth, complemented by modest revenue measures based on user-pay and affordability principles. Meanwhile, it is leveraging private sector capital through public-private partnerships and bond issuances to expedite the development of the Northern Metropolis, injecting new impetus into economic development.

During the meeting, Mr Chan also held bilateral discussions with the Chair of the Meeting, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Korea, Mr Koo Yun-cheol, to discuss further co-operation in trade, finance, and innovation and technology.

Mr Chan will attend the joint session of APEC Finance Ministers' Meeting and Structural Reform Ministerial Meeting tomorrow morning (October 22), before departing for Beijing. He will lead a government delegation to visit the Beijing subsidiary administrative centre and the Xiong'an New Area in Hebei."

Incoming passengers jailed for possessing and importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and for importing alternative smoking products (with photos),2025-10-21 18:50,2025-10-21 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100702.htm,"âTwo incoming male passengers were sentenced to six weeks and 10 months' imprisonment by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts and the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts respectively today (October 21) for importing and possessing duty-not-paid cigarettes, failing to declare them to Customs officers, as well as for importing alternative smoking products, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) and the Import and Export Ordinance (IEO). One of them was also fined $1,000.

Customs officers intercepted a 62-year-old incoming male passenger at the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point on October 11 and seized 1 781 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes with an estimated market value of about $7,300 and a duty potential of about $5,900 from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested. He was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment by the Fanling Magistrates' Courts today in contravention of the DCO.

Also, Customs officers intercepted a 37-year-old incoming male passenger at Hong Kong International Airport on August 25.

He was subsequently arrested. The man was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today in contravention of the DCO and IEO.

Customs welcomes the sentence, noting that even a first-time offender may still be imprisoned. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.

Under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

Under the IEO, any person who imports an alternative smoking product into Hong Kong commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.

  Addressing the seminar, the Head of the CSC, Mr Oscar Kwok, said that Hong Kong is rooted in profound traditional Chinese culture while also being deeply influenced by Western culture, developing a cultural perspective that blends the East and the West. It is especially evident in the realm of popular culture, such as film and music, where Hong Kong has made unique contributions and has served as an important window for the world to appreciate the diverse charms of both Hong Kong and Chinese culture. Hong Kong thus serves as a ""cultural interpreter"" in strengthening international cultural exchange. Hong Kong attracts outstanding talent from around the world, boasts world-class arts and cultural infrastructure, and stands as one of the world's leading arts trading centres. As an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange, Hong Kong should fully leverage its advantages to promote innovative development in arts and culture while advancing mutual learning among civilisations.

  About 140 civil servants in directorate, senior, and middle ranks from 39 bureaux/departments attended the seminar in person or online today.

  The Executive Series on Brokering North and South: China in a Multipolar World invites renowned scholars and leaders from the Mainland and overseas as guest speakers to inspire civil servants to reflect on the influence of China, as a major player in a multipolar world, on the global community amid the rise of the Global South and profound changes in the international landscape, and to explore how Hong Kong, as a city where East meets West, should leverage its strengths in its unique role in connecting the country with the world. It covers subjects pertaining to the rise of the Global South and international order, upholding principles and innovation in arts and culture and international communication, and a holistic approach to national security and global initiatives, among others."

今年財長會議聚焦討論環球和亞太區的經濟情況與展望、數字金融、各經濟體的公共財政政策等議題。

陳茂波在會上的各個環節都發言。在討論環球和區域經濟展望時，陳茂波表示，環球經濟增長在單邊主義和關稅的挑戰下有放緩的勢頭，當前世界經濟正面臨極大不確定性，一些經濟體還須面對合作與脅迫之間，以及共同繁榮與狹隘私利之間的抉擇。他指出，在這個背景下，中國香港堅定維持自由開放的貿易與投資環境，為全球企業和資本提供穩定、先後一致和可預期的營商環境。他呼籲各成員經濟體堅定維護以規則為本的多邊貿易體系，團結合作，推動區域經濟的可持續增長。

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-21 18:20,2025-10-21 18:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100698.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 21), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 42 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  According to information from the Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Administration, there were 2 086 new CF cases in Guangdong last week (October 12 to 18), showing a decrease compared to the previous week (October 5 to 11), which reported 2 257 cases. Most of the cases (795 cases) were recorded in Jiangmen last week, followed by Foshan (241 cases), Shenzhen (202 cases) and Guangzhou (189 cases). All cases were mild, with no severe or fatal cases reported.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call1823in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

今年財長會議聚焦討論環球和亞太區的經濟情況與展望、數字金融、各經濟體的公共財政政策等議題。

陳茂波在會上的各個環節都發言。在討論環球和區域經濟展望時，陳茂波表示，環球經濟增長在單邊主義和關稅的挑戰下有放緩的勢頭，當前世界經濟正面臨極大不確定性，一些經濟體還須面對合作與脅迫之間，以及共同繁榮與狹隘私利之間的抉擇。他指出，在這個背景下，中國香港堅定維持自由開放的貿易與投資環境，為全球企業和資本提供穩定、先後一致和可預期的營商環境。他呼籲各成員經濟體堅定維護以規則為本的多邊貿易體系，團結合作，推動區域經濟的可持續增長。

在討論數字金融的環節上，陳茂波指出，區塊鏈技術和人工智能正引領數字金融服務快速發展，它們不單能提升效率和降低成本，也有助推動普惠金融。他以中國香港的經驗，分享了對金融科技生態發展的三點意見。一、金融創新應服務實體經濟，而通過公私營合作，能推動更普惠包容的金融服務。他以數據互通為例，指出香港金融管理局推出「商業數據通」平台，通過數據共享以便利中小企融資，至今已支援逾6萬宗貸款申請，並批出超過65億美元的貸款。二、監管機構除履行監管職責外，亦應鼓勵創新，推動市場發展。他以香港金融監管機構的「監管沙盒」為例作說明，表示金融機構和創科公司均可利用這沙盒，測試其創新金融科技方案的可行性，過程中還可參考監管機構的回饋，以進一步改善其最後方案。三、在數字資產及人工智能越趨廣泛應用於金融服務的背景下，各經濟體應重視有關創新是否負責任和可持續，包括須顧及投資者利益和金融穩定。陳茂波表示，香港積極參與數字金融的跨境合作與政策對話，並願與區內夥伴深化在相關領域的合作。

在討論公共財政政策的環節上，陳茂波分享了中國香港的經濟發展策略，包括鞏固國際金融中心和貿易中心等優勢產業，並推動創科等新興產業發展。此外，他也簡介了政府的財政整合計劃，以控制政府開支增長為主，並按「用者自付」及「能者多付」的原則適度提高收入為輔。同時，亦會積極運用市場資源，例如公私營合作及發債等，以提速發展北部都會區，為經濟注入更大的發展動能。

Mr Tse welcomed the delegation and said that the HKSAR Government attaches great importance to the local agriculture and fisheries industries and promotes their sustainable development by complementing the direction of national development. The HKSAR Government will continue to implement measures under the Blueprint for the Sustainable Development of Agriculture and Fisheries to helpfishermen/farmers switch to modernised and sustainable operation modes, attract more young people to join the industry, integrate into the development plan of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and enhance the quality, quantity, and output value of local agricultural and fisheries products in the long run.

The Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation, Mr Mickey Lai, introduced to the delegation the Government's work in supporting the development of the agriculture and fisheries industries, including developing deep-sea mariculture in new fish culture zones, launching the ""Fish enJoy"" Scheme to promote leisure fisheries, developing urban farming, and promoting the development of a multi-storey, modernised, and environmentally friendly pig farm by the industry.

Through inspecting the landing and sale of catches at the Aberdeen Wholesale Fish Market, the delegation understood that the FMO has been providing the fisheries industry with services such as wholesale of chilled fish and live seafood, supply of clean seawater, as well as promoting local fisheries products. All profits are then used to support the development of local fisheries, including improving market services and facilities and providing low-interest loans to fishermen. The delegation also met with local fishermen and tasted local processed speciality fisheries products.

The FMO, established under the Marine Fish (Marketing) Ordinance (Cap. 291), is a financially independent non-profit organisation led by the Director of Marketing, a post concurrently held by the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation. The Aberdeen Wholesale Fish Market is one of the busiest fish wholesale markets under the FMO. In 2024, the market handled approximately 4970tonnes of chilled marine fish and about 3622tonnes of live seafood, accounting for around 15 per cent and nearly 50 per cent of the FMO's total wholesale volume, respectively."

黃恩諾表示，過去六十年，國家動用了大量人力及物力推行多項擴建、改造工程及生態環保措施，並限制開發東江流域沿線保護區，以及在受保護範圍內禁止採石、開礦及進行大規模禽畜養殖等活動，以保障供港東江水水質，香港用以儲存東江水的水塘才能孕育出優質魚，體現民間智慧「養好魚先養好水」。今次參賽作品數目超出預期，收到許多高質素的作品。冠軍作品將用作本地水塘優質魚產品的品牌標誌。

水務署定期在水塘投放魚苗並撈捕已完全成長的魚，以維持水塘生態平衡及水質優良。其中，本地水塘船灣淡水湖繼去年底成功註冊為優質養魚場，今年八月亦獲頒發有機水產養殖認證，魚類的質量備受認可。為善用資源和推廣本地優質魚產品，水務署聯同魚類統營處推出鮮味魚湯系列以及百分百香港本地鯪魚燒賣，於今年八月的香港美食博覽首次公開發售。另外，部分魚產品將贈予非牟利機構，藉此向社區表達關懷。"
Celebration of the 60th Anniversary of Dongjiang Water Supply to Hong Kong - Good Water Good Fish Logo Design Competition results announced (with photos),2025-10-21 17:15,2025-10-21 17:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100608.htm,"To celebrate the 60th anniversary of Dongjiang's water supply to Hong Kong, the Water Supplies Department (WSD) organised the Good Water Good Fish Logo Design Competition with an aim of conveying an important message that local reservoirs being able to produce high-quality reservoir fish is attributable to the high-quality Dongjiang water stored in them. The competition attracted an overwhelming response, with nearly 500 entries received from Hong Kong and other places. Judging was held today (October 21), during which a champion, first runner-up, and second runner-up were selected. The adjudication panel comprised internationally renowned artist Dr Kan Tai-keung; Legislative Council Member (Tourism) Mr Perry Yiu; the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Water Supplies, Professor Joseph Kwan; the Director of Water Supplies, Mr Roger Wong; as well as representatives from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, the design industry, and the fisheries sector.

Mr Wong remarked that over the past 60 years, the country has mobilised a large amount of labour and resources to implement a number of expansion and improvement works as well as ecological conservation measures along the Dongjiang River Basin, in which development has been strictly restricted with activities such as quarrying, mining, and large-scale livestock farming prohibited within protected zones to safeguard the quality of Dongjiang water supplied to Hong Kong. Dongjiang water stored in local reservoirs in Hong Kong can thus nurture high-quality fish, with the traditional wisdom ""To cultivate good fish, one must first maintain good water"" being proved right. The number of entries for the competition has exceeded expectations, with many high-quality entries received. The winning entry will be used as the logo for high-quality fish products from local reservoirs.

The WSD regularly releases fish fry into local reservoirs and catches mature fish to maintain an ecological balance and preserve good water quality. The local Plover Cove Reservoir was registered as an accredited fish farm at the end of 2024 and received its organic aquaculture certification in August this year. The fish caught from this reservoir are recognised for their remarkable quality. To make efficient use of these resources in reservoirs and promote local high-quality fish products, the WSD is collaborating with the Fish Marketing Organization to produce umami fish soup products and 100 per cent local mud carp siu mai, which were first offered for sale at the Hong Kong Food Expo this August. Additionally, some fish products are donated to non-profit organisations to benefit the community."

政務司副司長出席2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-21 16:53,2025-10-21 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100500.htm,"以下是政務司副司長卓永興今日（十月二十一日）出席2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮的致辭：

衣學東主任（國務院國有資產監督管理委員會研究中心主任）、張政偉主任（國際可持續準則理事會主席特別顧問兼北京辦公室主任）、李萌副處長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部金融處副處長）、鄭勇男副董事長（香港大公文匯傳媒集團副董事長、總經理）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友︰

大家好！很高興參加由香港大公文匯傳媒集團舉辦的2025香港國際ESG論壇暨年度榜單評選頒獎典禮。

行政長官的二○二五年《施政報告》推出了數項有利於推動環境、社會及企業管治（ESG）發展的舉措，包括：推動新能源產業發展，加速綠色技術落地，例如建設可持續航空燃料產業鏈和落實《香港氫能發展策略》；以及推動綠色創科成果商品化，例如支持市場發展換電型電動車及自動化換電站技術，和推動市場加快為現有建築物減碳等。

今天活動的主題名為「綠色金融匯聚，價值共創新生」，展示了推動ESG發展和綠色金融的密切關係。接下來，我想與大家分享香港在綠色和可持續金融方面的最新發展。

作為國際金融中心，香港正朝着國際綠色金融中心的方向邁進。香港擁有既深且廣的資本市場，能為不同發展階段的企業提供多元化的投融資渠道，同時把國際資金引導至優質的可持續發展項目。截至今年六月，獲證券及期貨事務監察委員會認可的ESG基金超過200隻，資產管理規模超過1.1萬億港元，分別較三年前增加51%及18%。在債券市場方面，去年在香港安排發行的綠色和可持續債券總額約3,354億港元，佔地區總額約四成半，並自二○一八年起連續七年居於亞洲區市場的首位。此外，在政府可持續債券計劃下，我們自二○一九年起已成功發行合共約2,400億港元等值的政府綠色債券，涵蓋不同類型、貨幣種類和年期，為多個本地綠色項目融資，並為潛在發行人提供重要基準。

香港是全球領先的可持續金融樞紐。特區政府全力推動符合國際標準、且一致和可比較的氣候及可持續發展的相關資訊的披露，以提升資本市場就相關資訊的透明度，便利投資者作出投資決策。去年十二月，我們推出《香港可持續披露路線圖》，就大型公眾責任實體不遲於二○二八年全面採用國際財務報告可持續披露準則（簡稱ISSB準則）提供清晰的路徑。今年六月，香港亦獲得國際財務報告準則基金會確認為首批以全面採用ISSB準則為目標的司法管轄區，顯示香港作為推動採用ISSB準則的先鋒。

為更好地結合金融科技和綠色金融，推動經濟綠色轉型，我們積極拓展綠色金融科技的生態圈，打造香港成為綠色金融科技樞紐。政府於去年六月推出全新的綠色和可持續金融科技概念驗證測試資助計劃，提供前期資助，推動進行綠色金融科技活動的科技公司或研究機構與本地企業合作，開發處理行業痛點的新項目，助力有關方案商業化和完成概念驗證。該計劃至今已批出60個綠色金融科技方案，並正陸續通過概念驗證，讓有潛力的綠色和可持續金融科技能在香港的商業環境中更廣泛應用。

嘉賓們、朋友們，ESG生態圈的發展有賴我們每一位的積極參與和支持。我呼籲在座各位把握今天的機會，與其他參加者交流討論，就推動香港以至全球綠色轉型及可持續未來的工作，貢獻智慧和力量。我亦祝賀今年在香港國際ESG年度榜單評選中獲獎的80間公司及機構。感謝你們為ESG建設作出的卓越貢獻，不但鼓勵更多企業走向綠色轉型，同時亦向世界展示國家在推動ESG發展和管理中的積極性和進步性。

最後，我亦想為一件關係香港未來的大事，作出呼籲。立法會的高水平、有效運作，對推動香港的經濟社會發展，至為關鍵。第八屆立法會的選舉，將在十二月七日舉行。我請大家到時踴躍參與投票，以手上一票，為「一國兩制」在香港的成功實踐行穩致遠，以及特區良政善治、長治久安和美好的未來，盡愛國愛港者的責任，貢獻力量。謝謝大家。​"

Hong Kong Customs detects smuggling case of suspected scheduled endangered species by air (with photo),2025-10-21 16:45,2025-10-21 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100587.htm,"Hong Kong Customs on October 18 detected an air freight smuggling case of suspected scheduled endangered species and seized about 202 kilograms of suspected scheduled sea cucumbers with an estimated market value of about $520,000 at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA).

Based on risk assessment, Customs on that day examined an inbound air cargo consignment from Saudi Arabia, declared as dried fish, at the Customs Cargo Examination Compound at HKIA. Upon inspection, Customs officers found the batch of suspected scheduled sea cucumbers in five carton boxes therein. A cargo recipient was arrested.

An investigation is ongoing. The likelihood of more arrests is not ruled out.

Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement actions against all kinds of smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.

Smuggling of scheduled endangered species is a serious offence. Under the Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance, anyone importing, exporting or possessing specimens of endangered species not in accordance with the Ordinance commits an offence and will be liable to a maximum fine of $10 million and imprisonment for 10 years upon conviction.
â
Members of the public may report any suspected smuggling activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)."

海關當日根據風檢評估於機場海關驗貨場檢查一個從沙特阿拉伯進口，報稱載有魚乾的空運貨物。經查驗後，海關人員在其中五個紙箱內檢獲該批懷疑受管制海參。一名貨物收貨人被捕。

案件仍在調查中，不排除會有更多人被捕。

海關會繼續透過風險評估和情報分析，嚴厲打擊各類型走私活動。

走私受管制瀕危物種屬嚴重罪行，根據《保護瀕危動植物物種條例》，任何人如非按照《條例》規定進出口或管有瀕危物種均屬違法，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款一千萬元及監禁十年。
​
市民可致電海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/）舉報懷疑走私活動。"

以下是立法會內務委員會主席李慧琼今日（十月二十一日）於立法會綜合大樓會見傳媒的發言︰

早前的內務委員會會議上，議員同意由我以內務委員會主席身分，在明日的立法會會議上，動議告别議案。

近日，有不同議員就告别議案的安排，向我表達意見。有部分議員關注到，新一屆立法會選舉提名期於十月二十四日，即星期五開始，與最後一次立法會會議辯論時間其實是非常接近，而最新的評估是，選情是異常激烈，亦有部分議員擔心，如果在立法會會議上進行告別議案辯論，有可能對選舉造成不公平。

亦有部分議員向我表達，由於選舉提名期即將展開，希望爭取更多時間聚焦處理選舉事宜。當然亦有部分議員希望繼續辯論。

經過審慎考慮所有因素，並與核心組的成員商量，以及跟不同議員溝通後，我決定撤回動議告別議案的預告，讓議員可以更加聚焦處理議會工作，亦確保選舉的公平性。"

創新科技及工業局局長出席騰雲香港科創集群加速器開幕典禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-21 15:00,2025-10-21 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100519.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十月二十一日）在騰雲香港科創集群加速器（騰雲加速器）開幕典禮的致辭：

尊敬的黃濤先生（騰雲加速器聯合創始人、世紀金源集團總裁）、方方先生（騰雲加速器聯合創始人、香港水木投資集團合夥人）、張鈺晶會長（中國機電產品進出口商會會長）、鄭松岩總裁（香港數碼港管理有限公司行政總裁）、葛明博士（工業專員（創新及科技））、謝副局長（深圳市前海深港現代服務業合作區管理局副局長謝暉暉）、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家好！今天我非常高興與各位一同見證騰雲香港科創集群加速器落戶數碼港。

初創企業的蓬勃發展對一個地區科技創新和產業創新的發展至關重要：除了為經濟提供新動能和更多可能性之外，同時可以匯聚資源、吸引人才。在特區政府的大力推動下，香港初創企業數目去年已經達到4 700間，這些都顯示了香港的創科初創生態發展日益蓬勃。

為進一步完善本地創科生態圈，加快推動香港發展成為國際創新科技中心，行政長官在去年的《施政報告》中提出創科加速器先導計劃，目的是吸引海內外具豐富經驗的初創加速器落戶香港，建立加速器基地，進一步豐富本地專業初創服務。該計劃上月已獲得立法會財務委員會通過撥款，將為香港的初創企業提供更全面和精準的扶持，促進初創企業做大做強。

騰雲香港科創集群加速器的成立及啓用響應了特區政府扶持初創企業的政策方向。我非常感謝黃濤先生、方方先生等一批企業家、投資銀行家，以及行業專家共同發起成立騰雲加速器，攜同70多家聚焦人工智能、生物醫藥、醫療器械、能源科技等領域的優秀創科企業及投資機構來港發展，利用數碼港的優勢，為進駐的企業提供全面服務，助其在香港落地、布局、發展。加上特區政府即將推出的優化版創科創投基金及即將在明年推出全新的創科產業引導基金，將為香港創科企業的發展創造更為有利的條件。

香港是國家「引進來、走出去」的雙向通道，亦是內地企業進軍海外市場的首選出海平台。特區政府銳意發展創科，有別於以往企業需要個別建立或引進的模式，加速器的成立可以一次性地引進以支持大批初創企業並提供更精準及具系統性的支援，產生集群效應，體現香港支持初創企業發展質和量的提升。我歡迎騰雲加速器引入的多間優秀創科企業及投資機構來港發展，也期望不久的將來有更多優秀的加速器基地在港成立，共同深耕香港的創科樂土。

最後，祝賀騰雲加速器和在座各位業務蒸蒸日上！祝國家及香港的創科品牌在國際舞台上越發亮麗！謝謝大家！"

Speech by STL at IATA World Sustainability Symposium,2025-10-21 13:03,2025-10-21 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100380.htm,"Following is the speech by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the IATA World Sustainability Symposium today (October 21):

Mr Walsh (Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Mr Willie Walsh), Patrick (Chair of Cathay Group, Mr Patrick Healy), Ronald (Chief Executive Officer of Cathay Group, Mr Ronald Lam), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

A warm welcome and good morning to you all. For friends from afar, welcome to Hong Kong. It is my great honour to address this esteemed gathering this morning at the World Sustainability Symposium. I stand before you today with a deep sense of purpose, as we come together to chart a path toward a more sustainable future for the aviation industry globally and for Hong Kong.

First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to IATA and the Cathay Group for inviting me to speak at this prestigious occasion, which is one of IATA's signature events of the year. It is a fitting choice for you to host the third edition of the symposium here in Hong Kong - a city that we all love and has emerged as a leading player in sustainable aviation in the region. I have heard that this year's edition has brought together nearly 500 participants from all over the world, including senior executives, professional experts, and thought leaders in the field of green aviation. I warmly welcome all of you to Hong Kong and sincerely hope you take some time to explore and enjoy the vibrancy and warmth in Hong Kong. This hotel is well-situated, where you can have a good perspective of our harbour.

My bureau oversees not only aviation but also land transport, maritime and logistics. Not only are we charting a path towards green aviation, we have also promulgated a series of action plans and blueprints to promote green transport and green shipping.

Our presence here today underscores a shared commitment to achieving a sustainable future for aviation. With so many distinguished experts in the room, I need not reiterate the critical importance of sustainability and decarbonisation in the aviation sector. This symposium provides a unique platform for leaders from around the world to exchange perspectives and provide solutions on green aviation. As we embark on this dialogue, I would like to begin by sharing Hong Kong's achievements and our forward-looking blueprint for building a sustainable aviation ecosystem.

When we speak of sustainability in aviation, our recent focus must be on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. This is indeed a complex and multifaceted challenge that demands co-operation and collaboration amongst a wide array of stakeholders, including governments, airlines, fuel suppliers, industry partners, and the traveling public. In Hong Kong, we are taking decisive steps to develop a SAF industry and promote the use of it at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). In our view, it is of utmost importance that we join hands to scale up the production of SAF, as we all know that it is currently the only practical means for international aviation to decarbonise.

The HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government is dedicated to fostering a robust SAF supply and its supply chain in collaboration with Mainland authorities and local enterprises, from upstream raw material collection to the establishment of production plants and large-scale production and supply. Given Hong Kong's close proximity to the Chinese Mainland, which has the largest supply of used cooking oil, we are leveraging this advantage to create a significant SAF supply for Hong Kong. Moreover, as 100 per cent neat SAF cannot be uplifted to aircraft at this moment, we are actively exploring the construction of a SAF blending facility right here in Hong Kong. This facility aims to support the provision of competitively priced SAF-blended jet fuel in the long run, hence raising the competitiveness of Hong Kong's SAF industry. By doing so, we also aim to strengthen the bargaining power of airlines operating from HKIA, ultimately fostering HKIA's competitiveness as an international aviation hub.

On this floor, I know that Cathay Pacific Group has been leading and is very dedicated in pushing forward the use of SAF. Of course, we would work closely with Cathay as our close partner. We are also mindful of the pragmatic and practical considerations faced by different airlines in Hong Kong. In a way, we hope to create a critical mass and to achieve and secure a reasonably priced SAF supply and production to enable us to create a robust supply chain for SAF in Hong Kong. With the above measures in place and subject to regional SAF industry development, we adopt a vision to achieve a SAF consumption ratio of 1 per cent to 2 per cent for flights departing from HKIA by 2030 as a starting point to drive momentum.

  ""The Chief Executive's Policy Address"" announced just last month includes quite some paragraphs on how we would strive ourselves to achieve the SAF consumption target. We, in a recent briefing for our legislature, disclosed the target that I mentioned just now. I received a lot of feedback asking whether Hong Kong could set a more aggressive target. Replying to the stakeholders and the legislative councillors was that we want to be pragmatic and realistic. We want to put it into action. So, we set a target which we hope to achieve. That is a starting point, and this should not preclude or hinder us from setting an even more aggressive target along the way.

Apart from the industry and aviation partners, I think public education is also very important. As we take people along from places to places, the travelling public need to raise their awareness for green aviation. It helps build a collective understanding of the role SAF plays in reducing aviation's carbon footprint. The Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) will, for instance, launch targeted publicity and promotional campaigns to raise awareness among the public and corporations about the importance of SAF, and the need for everyone to do their part. By engaging communities and businesses, we aim to create a culture of sustainability that supports long-term environmental goals. I think this culture of sustainability is the basic, core element and spirit that IATA has also been promoting around the globe.

Speaking of AAHK, I am proud to highlight their unwavering commitment to sustainability. Apart from SAF that I spoke of a lot, together with key aviation-related business partners, AAHK is dedicated to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2050, a bold step making HKIA the world's greenest airport. Their efforts to embed sustainability into new developments at HKIA, integrate environmental best interests and practices, and address climate change and resilience given the airport's coastal location have all gained significant momentum. Initiatives such as trialing renewable diesel, expanding the use of electric and autonomous vehicles on the Airport Island, as well as continuously upgrading its equipment by incorporating more energy-efficient installation and technologies reflect a holistic approach to sustainable development at HKIA.

We are all acutely aware that the journey to a sustainable future in the aviation sector is not a solo mission. It is a global challenge and mission that requires collaboration across borders, industries, and sectors. The HKSAR Government is committed to playing a pivotal role by leading, offering policy support, driving innovation and technology, and most importantly, cultivating an enabling environment for sustainable aviation. Our door is always open. We will maintain close communication with international organisations, airlines, the airport community, fuel suppliers and industry stakeholders to tackle pressing challenges and difficulties. As Dr Thomsen (Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist of IATA, Dr Marie Owens Thomsen) just mentioned, it is not just saying when there is a will, there is a way. We have to create ways so as to make our will works. It is the time not for words, but for action.

Last but not least, international collaboration is paramount in this endeavor. No single city, country, or organisation can achieve net zero alone. We must share knowledge, pool resources and align our strategies to create a unified global response to the climate crisis. We have been facing very frequent super typhoons over the past weeks and months in Hong Kong, which is quite unprecedented. Our airport and aviation community have been making our best efforts to respond, recover and resurrect, but nothing is more important than tackling this issue at the heart of the problem and do it with passion and determination. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is precisely why gatherings like this symposium are vital for fostering such partnerships.

I truly look forward to the rich discussions and innovative insights that will emerge from this symposium, sparking actionable outcomes. And with the talent and the dedication I see in this room, I am more than confident that we can turn the vision of net zero by 2050 into a reality. It's a goal championed by IATA, but it's a future we will build together.

Lastly, I wish you all productive, inspiring and impactful sessions ahead. Thank you very much.

Speech by DSJ at International Conference of Legal Regulators 2025 (English only) (with photo),2025-10-21 12:37,2025-10-21 12:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100371.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Deputy Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the International Conference of Legal Regulators 2025 today (October 21):

President Tong (President of The Law Society of Hong Kong, Mr Roden Tong), Dr Kelvin Wong (Chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you all at the International Conference of Legal Regulators today. My warmest welcome to the leaders and representatives from across the global legal regulatory community. I am particularly delighted that Hong Kong has been chosen as the venue for hosting the conference this year. Your presence here reflects our shared commitment to upholding the highest standards of the legal profession.

  The theme of this year's Conference, ""New Ways to Regulate in a Changing World?"", is not only timely but profoundly critical. We are navigating an era of unprecedented and simultaneous transformation. Breakthroughs in technology and global economic shifts present both opportunities and challenges for legal regulators worldwide. Our discussions over the coming days will focus on fostering a resilient and adaptive regulatory environment, which is essential for upholding the rule of law.

  In Hong Kong, our approach to these global challenges is firmly anchored in our constitutional principle of ""one country, two systems"". This principle, enshrined in our Basic Law, is the bedrock of our success and stability. It is the foundation that underpins our common law system, which continues to operate robustly.

  Central to this system is the independent exercise of legal and regulatory powers. Our Judiciary exercises independent judicial power free from any interference. Similarly, the regulation of legal practitioners is handled independently by the legal profession itself. The Law Society of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Bar Association, as the self-regulatory bodies for their respective professions, perform this critical function with the highest degree of professionalism, integrity, and diligence. Their work in upholding stringent ethical standards, ensuring professional competence, and administering a fair disciplinary system is conducted strictly in accordance with the law, free from interference. This independent self-regulation is a cornerstone of our legal framework and a key reason for the immense international confidence placed in Hong Kong's status as a leading international legal and dispute resolution hub.

  While our foundations are strong, we are facing several new challenges.

  First, technological disruption, particularly the development of artificial intelligence (AI), is fundamentally reshaping the practice of law. These tools offer potential to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve access to justice. However, they also pose regulatory questions on accountability, confidentiality of clients, and ethical practice.

  At present, the laws in Hong Kong protect the legitimate rights and interests of individuals, enterprises and various other organisations in different spheres. To manage potential risks in promoting the ongoing technological development, the Department of Justice will establish an interdepartmental working group to review the legislation needed to support a wider application of AI. This initiative is part of our broader strategy to encourage AI applications across different sectors, while ensuring that regulatory frameworks keep pace with technological advancements.

  Second, the expansion of cross-border trade amplifies the need for mediation and arbitration, which in turn necessitates a stronger regulatory framework for such services. The Department of Justice established the Working Group on Mediation Regulatory System in October last year to review the regulatory system for the accreditation and disciplinary matters of the mediation profession in Hong Kong, and to make recommendations on enhancing the professionalism of mediators. We will implement measures for strengthening the system for the mediation profession in Hong Kong by the end of this year, as well as take forward the relevant legislative work next year. These efforts aim at ensuring our regulatory frameworks remain fit for purpose in a globalised and increasingly mediated legal environment.

  Third, the increasing cross-border nature of legal practice challenges our traditionally jurisdiction-specific regulatory models. This requires the enhancement of cross-border co-operation. Exchange of insights, sharing of best practices, and building mutual understanding through collaboration is necessary.

  Hong Kong is proud to contribute to this vital global conversation. Our unique position as a gateway between the East and the West, along with our professional legal sector and robust common law system, make us a ""super connector"" in the field of legal regulation.

  Through this conference, we can pioneer the new regulatory pathways. I have every expectation that your deliberations over the next two days will be immensely stimulating, pioneering, and productive.

  I thank The Law Society of Hong Kong once again for its sterling efforts in hosting this pivotal event. To our distinguished international guests, I wish you a successful conference and a delightful stay in Hong Kong. Thank you very much."
創新科技及工業局局長出席香港江蘇科創中心啓用儀式致辭（只有中文）,2025-10-21 11:59,2025-10-21 12:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100348.htm,"以下是創新科技及工業局局長孫東教授今日（十月二十一日）在香港江蘇科創中心啓用儀式的致辭：

尊敬的趙副省長（江蘇省人民政府副省長趙岩）、唐英年會長（香港江蘇社團總會創會會長）、譚鐵牛書記（南京大學黨委書記）、葉水球副部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室教育科技部副部長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家上午好！非常高興與大家一同在香港數碼港參與今天這個重要活動。首先，我代表香港特區政府祝賀香港江蘇科創中心正式啓用，並歡迎趙副省長及各位江蘇省的領導和朋友們來港指導交流。

香港特區政府一直全力配合國家的科技創新發展策略，推動國家高質量發展。在國家的大力支持下，香港不只是全球重要的國際金融中心和國際貿易樞紐，也正全力發展成為國際創新科技中心。我們大力強化上游的基礎科研優勢，同時積極引進及培育科創企業，加速新型工業化以及新興和未來產業發展。

為了完善香港創科生態鏈，抓緊新一輪科技創新和產業變革的機遇，特區政府一直多管齊下促進上、中、下游協同發展。除了鞏固我們傳統的上游基礎科研的優勢之外，近年來，我們特別加強初創企業的支持，強化科研成果轉化和產業化，倡導「政、產、學、研、投」的高效合作，豐富創投融資渠道。其中，我們推出創科創投基金優化計劃，調撥資金與業界配對成立聯合基金，投資策略性產業的創科初創企業，進一步加大對本地初創企業的融資支持。明年，我們還將推出創科產業引導基金，結合市場力量投資創科產業在港發展。此外，我們亦會於今年內推出創科加速器先導計劃，吸引海內外具豐富經驗的專業初創企業服務機構在香港建立加速器基地，完善創科成長生態圈。

蘇港兩地互動素來頻繁，香港是粵港澳大灣區的核心城市，江蘇則是長三角地區具強大創新能力的經濟大省，兩地在科技創新領域一直密切交流合作。香港擁有「內聯外通」的獨特優勢，是國家「引進來、走出去」的雙向通道，也是越來越多內地企業進行國際化部署及擴充業務的重要據點。我相信通過香港江蘇科創中心的成立，蘇港兩地將進一步深化產學研合作，優勢互補，促進創科產業發展、孕育更多新企業，攜手為國家的高質量發展作出貢獻。

最後，我再次祝賀香港江蘇科創中心成立啟用，助力蘇港兩地創科合作踏上新台階。祝願今天的活動圓滿成功，各位身體健康，工作順利。謝謝！"

Hong Kong Scholarship for Excellence Scheme opens for applications,2025-10-21 11:13,2025-10-21 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102000153.htm,"The Education Bureau (EDB) today (October 21) announced that the Hong Kong Scholarship for Excellence Scheme (HKSES) will, from today until December 31, be open for applications from eligible Hong Kong students who intend to pursue undergraduate or postgraduate studies at world-renowned universities outside Hong Kong starting from the 2026/27 academic year.

A spokesman for the EDB said, ""As a merit-based scheme targeting the most outstanding Hong Kong students, the HKSES seeks to cultivate a cadre of brilliant young achievers with a sense of social responsibility and national identity, an affection for Hong Kong and an international perspective, who will return home after receiving a world-class education supported by the scholarship to enrich Hong Kong's talent pool and competitiveness in the long run. Selection will be based on candidates' academic achievements and other attributes such as leadership qualities and potential as well as their contributions and commitment to society. Awardees are required to complete their specific study programmes and undertake to return to Hong Kong upon graduation to work for at least two years or a period equivalent to the duration of the scholarship received, whichever is longer.""

Awardees will receive a non-means-tested scholarship to cover their tuition fees, subject to a ceiling of $300,000 per annum. In addition, the HKSES will provide additional support to financially needy awardees during their studies. Awardees who have passed the means test will receive a bursary of up to $200,000 per student per annum to cover their living and study-related expenses. The value of the award will be correspondingly reduced if an awardee also receives other awards, both locally and abroad, or assistance to finance his or her same studies overseas.

Apart from the monetary scholarship, the value of the HKSES also lies in its prestige and recognition as well as other non-monetary benefits. Awardees will receive a series of support and mentorship services to be rendered by the Government and other sectors of the community.

More details on the HKSES are available on the HKSES website (hkses.edb.gov.hk). Eligible students who intend to pursue their first year of undergraduate or postgraduate studies at world-renowned universities outside Hong Kong in the 2026/27 academic year (i.e. during the period from August 2026 to July 2027) may submit their applications for the scholarship online via the application system on the HKSES website on or before December 31, 2025, by 6pm. Late applications will not be accepted.

Shortlisted applicants will be invited by the EDB to attend interviews for the scholarship from April 2026 onwards after receiving unconditional offers from their chosen programmes. They will be notified of the results in due course after the interviews."

丘應樺首先與土耳其共和國總統府投資與金融局局長A Burak Dağlıoğlu會面，介紹香港最新的經貿發展，以及招商引資的主要措施，以鞏固香港作為國際貿易中心及商業樞紐的地位。他亦簡介香港最新成立的內地企業出海專班，以協助內地企業開拓包括土耳其在內的海外市場。雙方並就投資推廣策略及加強兩地在「一帶一路」倡議等多個領域的合作交換意見。

丘應樺隨後與土耳其對外經濟關係委員會成員舉行商務圓桌會議，向他們分享香港在「一國兩制」下的獨特優勢及為經濟注入動力的最新舉措，例如北部都會區和電子商貿的發展。因應環球經濟格局的轉變，不同經濟體均積極拓展新興市場以應對挑戰。丘應樺指出，香港是土耳其企業開拓東南亞及粵港澳大灣區市場的理想跳板，同時作為重要平台讓有意拓展海外業務的內地企業透過香港「走出去」，促進雙向貿易和投資，讓各方受惠。

此外，丘應樺禮節性拜會伊斯坦堡省長Davut Gül，介紹香港在不同領域的最新發展，並就加強香港與土耳其的商貿合作交換意見，以建立更緊密的雙邊關係。他亦簡介粵港澳大灣區的發展，以及為土耳其企業帶來的機遇。

晚上，丘應樺出席由投資推廣署及香港貿易發展局合辦的商務晚宴，推廣香港優越的營商環境和內聯外通的獨特優勢。他向約30位出席的商界領袖表示，香港與土耳其雙邊貿易關係良好，即使受前所未有的疫情衝擊，過去五年，兩地的商品貿易平均增長約百分之四。

丘應樺指出，香港和土耳其均為各自區域內的重要門戶。香港地理位置優越，位處亞洲的中心，成為開拓中國內地和亞洲市場的貿易和投資門戶。他亦與嘉賓分享香港作為全球第五大貿易經濟體（僅次於中國內地、歐洲聯盟、美國和日本）、全球第三大金融中心、最大的離岸人民幣中心，以及全球最自由經濟體等的優勢。

他鼓勵土耳其企業來港設立區域運營基地，以享受《內地與香港關於建立更緊密經貿關係的安排》下的優惠待遇，從而進入龐大的中國內地市場。他表示，加上香港實行簡單低稅制，資金自由流通，生活方式和文化充滿活力，是一個穩定、開放且具有韌性的國際樞紐，也是通往中國內地乃至亞洲地區進行貿易、投資、創新和人文交流的渠道。

晚宴前，丘應樺亦藉此機會與中國駐伊斯坦布爾總領事魏曉東會面，介紹香港的最新發展和深化國際交往合作的工作。

丘應樺將於十月二十一日（伊斯坦堡時間）轉赴格魯吉亞第比利斯，出席第比利斯絲綢之路國際論壇。"
SCED promotes HK's role as springboard to foster two-way investment and trade on visit to TÃ¼rkiye (with photos),2025-10-21 09:00,2025-10-21 09:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/21/P2025102100188.htm," The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, on his visit to Istanbul, Türkiye, on October 20 (Istanbul time) promoted Hong Kong's unparalleled advantages and its role as a springboard to foster two-way investment and trade with a view to strengthening the partnership between Hong Kong and Türkiye.

 Mr Yau first met with the President of the Investment and Finance Office of the Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye, Mr A Burak DaÄlÄ±oÄlu, to brief him on Hong Kong's latest economic and trade developments, and major measures to attract enterprises and investment to consolidate the city's position as an international trade centre and business hub. He also introduced the latest establishment of the Task Force on Supporting Mainland Enterprises in Going Global in Hong Kong to assist Mainland enterprises in exploring overseas markets including the Turkish one. They also exchanged views on investment promotion strategies and enhancing collaboration between Hong Kong and Türkiye in various areas including the Belt and Road Initiative.

 Mr Yau then held a business roundtable with members of the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Türkiye to share with them Hong Kong's unique advantages under the ""one country, two systems"" principle and latest initiatives such as the Northern Metropolis Development and e-commerce to inject economic impetus. In view of the changes in the global economic landscape, various economies are proactively exploring emerging markets to cope with challenges. He noted that Hong Kong is an ideal springboard for Turkish enterprises to tap into the Southeast Asian and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) markets, while at the same time serving as a key platform for Mainland companies seeking to expand their overseas business to go global via Hong Kong, boosting two-way trade and investment to benefit all.

 Mr Yau also paid a courtesy call on the Governor of Istanbul, Mr Davut Gül, to give him an update on Hong Kong’s latest developments in various fields and exchange views on business and trade collaboration between Hong Kong and Türkiye to forge closer bilateral ties. He also briefed him on the development of the GBA and the business opportunities it presents for Turkish enterprises.

 In the evening, Mr Yau attended a business dinner organised by Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council to promote Hong Kong's premier business environment and unique advantages of being closely connected to both the Mainland and the world. Speaking to some 30 participating business leaders, he said that Türkiye and Hong Kong have very good bilateral trade relationships. The merchandise trade between the two places during the past five years has seen an average growth of about 4 per cent despite the unprecedented hit of the pandemic.

 Mr Yau noted that the two places are both important gateways in their respective regions. Hong Kong is at a strategic location, right at the centre of Asia, enabling the city to serve as the gateway to trade and investments in the Chinese Mainland and the Asian markets. He also shared with the guests Hong Kong's strengths as the world's fifth-largest trading entity (after the Chinese Mainland, the European Union, the United States and Japan), the third-ranked global financial centre, the biggest offshore Renminbi centre and the world's freest economy, among others.

 He encouraged Turkish enterprises to set up their base of regional operations in Hong Kong to enjoy the preferential treatment under the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement to enter the vast Chinese Mainland market. He said that coupled with its simple and low tax system, free flow of capital and vibrant lifestyles and culture, Hong Kong is a stable, open and resilient international hub and a conduit to the Chinese Mainland and the broader Asian region for trade, investment, innovation and people-to-people exchange.

 Before the dinner, Mr Yau took the opportunity to meet with the Chinese Consul-General in Istanbul, Mr Wei Xiaodong, to keep him abreast of Hong Kong's latest developments and efforts to deepen international co-operation and exchange.

 Mr Yau will depart for Tbilisi, Georgia, on October 21 (Istanbul time) to attend the Tbilisi Silk Road Forum."

CHP urges schoolchildren to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported,2025-10-20 21:42,2025-10-20 22:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/20/P2025102000848.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 20) announced a case of severe paediatric influenza A infection.The CHP urged schools and parents to arrange for schoolchildren to receive free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza and its complications. Vaccination also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection.

The case involves a 2-year-old girl with good past health. She has developed a fever and convulsionsince yesterday (October 19). She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital today and was admitted for treatment. She is currently in serious condition. Her nasopharyngeal swab specimen tested positive for the influenza A(H3)virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis was influenza A infection complicated with encephalopathy.

The CHP investigation revealed thatthe girl was in Guangdong Province during part of the incubation period and returned to Hong Kong on October 17. She had not received the 2025/26 SIV yet. Her household contacts are currently asymptomatic.

  ""Hong Kong is currently in the summer influenza season and there has been a significant increase in influenza-like illnessoutbreaks in schools since September. As of October 20, 556 outbreaks have been reported in schools since the start of the school year in September, including 59 cases in kindergartens/child care centres, 298 cases in primary schools and 199 cases in secondary schools. Including the above case, 11 severe paediatric influenza cases, including one fatal case, involving children aged 2 to 17 have been recorded since the start of the school year. Nine of them had good past health. Members of the public, especially children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, should seek medical advice promptly if presented with fever and respiratory symptoms, for early treatment,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The 2025/26 SIV Programmes have commenced, offering free or subsidised SIV to eligible high-risk groups through various vaccination programmes.
