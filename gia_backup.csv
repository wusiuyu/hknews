Press briefing and media visit held on Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) (with photos/video),2025-12-16 19:49,2025-12-16 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600570.htm,"  The Highways Department (HyD), the Transport Department (TD) and the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) held a joint press briefing today (December 16) at the Central Kowloon Bypass (Yau Ma Tei Section) (CKB (YMTS)) Administration Building on the detailed arrangements for the commissioning of the CKB (YMTS) on December 21 (Sunday). The HyD also arranged a media visit to the CKB (YMTS) after the briefing.

  At the press briefing, representatives of the HyD, the TD and the HKPF introduced to the media the project highlights and construction challenges of the CKB (YMTS), its benefits, as well as the traffic enforcement and control arrangements after its commissioning. The CKB (YMTS) project, which was large in scale and full of challenges, involved the construction of various sections including flyovers, a drill-and-blast tunnel and an underwater tunnel in a bustling urban area. During the construction, the HyD adhered to a ""people-oriented"" principle, all along ensuring smooth surface traffic and the continued operation of nearby community facilities, while making efforts to enhance community amenities by making good use of the roofs of both tunnel portals to create landscaped decks, integrating recreational facilities into transportation infrastructure.

  Motorists will be able to travel directly between Yau Ma Tei and Kowloon Bay through the CKB (YMTS), with the journey time significantly reduced from currently about 30 minutes to just about five minutes. There will be eight bus routes using the CKB (YMTS) after its commissioning and it is expected that four additional bus routes will be using the CKB (YMTS) next year. The CKB will be a toll road, with tolls commencing when the entire CKB, including the Kowloon Bay Section, is fully commissioned next year.

  After the press briefing, media representatives boarded press coaches arranged by the HyD to visit both tunnel portals and the carriageway, experiencing the convenience brought by the CKB (YMTS) and gaining a better understanding of the tunnel facilities and the design of the connecting roads.

  To help motorists familiarise themselves with the driving routes in advance, the relevant driving guide and videos have been uploaded onto the CKB (YMTS) website (ckr-hyd.hk/travel/)."

Two men sentenced to six months' imprisonment for illegally importing alternative smoking products,2025-12-16 19:45,2025-12-16 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600759.htm,"âThe Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health (DH) was notified by Hong Kong Customs yesterday (December 15) that 60 000 alternative smoking products were intercepted in the luggage of two men arriving from Japan. TACO immediately arrested and prosecuted the two individuals. The case was heard today (December 16) at the West Kowloon Magistrates' Court, where both were convicted and sentenced to six months' immediate imprisonment.

Since the amendments to theTobacco Control Legislation (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, which conferred arrest powers on TACO inspectors,took effect on September 19 this year, TACO has prosecuted 14 cases involving the importation of large quantities of alternative smoking products. Sixteen persons have been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment ranging from two to six months.

According to the Import and Export Ordinance (Cap. 60), a person who imports alternative smoking products, including electronic smoking products, heated tobacco products and herbal cigarettes, commits an offence and isliable on summary conviction to a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for two years; or liable on conviction on indictment to a fine of $2,000,000 and imprisonment for seven years.

Moreover, under the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person may promote, manufacture, sell, or possess for commercial purposes alternative smoking products. An offender is liable to a fine of $50,000 and imprisonment for six months.

The DH welcomes the court's ruling, stating that the imprisonment carries significant deterrent effect. DH reminds the public and visitors not to bring alternative smoking products (such as e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products, or herbal cigarettes) into Hong Kong and not to use such products. TACO will continue to closely monitor and enforce the law to combat related offences.

The DH also cautions the public that alternative smoking products are addictive and are not effective smoking cessation tools. E-cigarettes may increase the risk of cancer, respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. Smokers are urged to quit smoking as early as possible for their own health and that of others. For assistance, please call the DH's Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline on 1833 183, or visit www.livetobaccofree.hk for information on quitting."

CHP investigates imported case of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli infection,2025-12-16 19:40,2025-12-16 20:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600752.htm,"âThe Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced today (December 16) that it is investigating an imported case of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection and reminded members of the public to maintain good personal, food and environmental hygiene to prevent intestinal infections.

The case involves a 55-year-old female with good past health. She developed abdominal pain and watery diarrhoea since November 30. She sought medical attention at aprivate doctor twice on December 4 and 5 but did not require hospitalisation. Her stool sample tested positive for STEC.

A preliminary investigation by the CHP revealed that the patient visited Japan between November 22 and 29 (within the incubation period) and consumed high-risk food there. The patient's family member, who travelled with her, is asymptomatic so far. The CHP is following up on the health condition of her household contact and will continue to investigate the case.

Over the past five years (2020 to 2024), the CHP recorded one to six cases of STEC infection annually. Including the case announced above, four cases of STEC infection have been recorded so far this year. No significant upward trend or unusual cluster cases have been identified.

Generally, STEC infections are usually associated with the consumption of contaminated food or water, such as raw or undercooked meat products, contaminated fruits and vegetables, and unpasteurised dairy products. Direct person-to-person transmission through the faecal-oral route can also occur. Waterborne transmission has been reported, both from contaminated drinking water and from recreational waters. The public is advised to observe good personal and food hygiene.

Members of the public may refer to the CHP'swebpagefor more information about STEC."

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-12-16 19:08,2025-12-16 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600728.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (December 16), two new imported cases of chikungunya fever (CF) with epidemiological linkages have been recorded.    
  
Latest case information
-----------------------------

 The two cases are from the same household and involve a 44-year-old female and a 55-year-old male who live in Sham Shui Po District. A preliminary investigation revealed that they had visited Jieyang in Guangdong Province December 10 and 11, and had suffered mosquito bites in rural areas there. The female patient developed joint pain on December 14, followed by a fever yesterday (December 15). The male patient developed joint pain and a fever on the same day. They then attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital. They were admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are now in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. They have a household contact (who did not travel to Jieyang), who is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.They did not have other travel collaterals.

  An epidemiolocal investigation showed that their residence and usual activity areas do not overlap with areas where imported or local cases have been recorded in the recent month.As the patients visited Guangdong Province together during the incubation period, and no epidemiological linkages have been established between these two cases and other cases recently recorded in Hong Kong, the CHP therefore considered that the cases were infected during their travel. The cases are classified as imported. The CHP has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

  Hong Kong has recorded a total of 81 confirmed CF cases this year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the trails are currently closed until further notice. As the CHP and the relevant government departments are conducting large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails recently, the CHP continues to appeal to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations.

  The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm. All doctors and hospitals in Hong Kong should closely monitor whether their patients present with compatible symptoms and arrange blood tests for those concerned. The CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch will provide free testing services.

  Specifically targeting confirmed cases who visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the hiking trails. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts, to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  TheFEHDand relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  âThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
Import of poultry meat and products from areas in US suspended,2025-12-16 19:08,2025-12-16 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600630.htm,"  The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (December 16) that in view of notifications from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) about outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Edmunds County of the State of South Dakota and Wayne County of the State of North Carolina in the United States (US), the CFS has instructed the trade to suspend the import of poultry meat and products (including poultry eggs) from the above-mentioned areas with immediate effect to protect public health in Hong Kong.

  A CFS spokesman said that according to the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong imported about 40 060 tonnes of chilled and frozen poultry meat and about 2.62 million poultry eggs from the US in the first nine months of this year.

  ""The CFS has contacted the American authority over the issues and will closely monitor information issued by the WOAH and the relevant authorities on the avian influenza outbreaks. Appropriate action will be taken in response to the development of the situation,"" the spokesman said."
FSD steps up inspections and encourages industry to inspect fire service installations and equipment,2025-12-16 18:44,2025-12-16 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600721.htm,"The Fire Services Department (FSD) said today (December 16) that in response to the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, the department has maintained close collaboration with relevant property management organisations and stepped up inspections of fire service installations and equipment (FSIs) in buildings since December 4, with a view to enhancing building fire safety.

The FSD has redeployed manpower internally to enhance inspections of FSIs in buildings, particularly those undergoing major maintenance, and has proactively inspected the functional status of fire alarms. Should any non-compliance be identified, the department will conduct thorough investigations and decisively take enforcement actions. At the same time, the department has redeployed personnel to promptly follow up on reports of abnormal operation of FSIs in buildings and will take appropriate enforcement actions accordingly.

In addition, the FSD has earlier engaged in in-depth exchanges with the Property Management Services Authority (PMSA), the Hong Kong Association of Property Management Companies Limited (HKAPSA), the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA), the Hong Kong Housing Society (HS), and the Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong (REDA). The FSD emphasises that, apart from ensuring that annual inspections of FSIs are conducted in their premises in accordance with the Fire Service (Installations and Equipment) Regulations (Cap. 95B), property management bodies must also proactively discharge their management duties and assist property owners in properly maintaining the FSIs in common areas to ensure their continuous and effective operation. The FSD also reminds property management personnel to inspect the FSIs regularly during daily work and assist owners and their organisations to handle any damage or malfunctions of the FSIs in a timely manner.

To address public concerns regarding the performance of building fire alarms, stakeholders have agreed to promote voluntary fire alarm testing to safeguard public safety. The scope of the testing includes:

Checking that manual call points are intact and capable of activating the fire alarm system;
Ensuring stable power supply to FSIs and reliable operation of standby power supply; and
Verifying that signals transmitted from fire control panels are normal with no false alarms or failures.
	

The HA and the HS have arranged to conduct fire alarm tests progressively in all public rental housing estates and residential projects under their management. The PMSA and the HKAPSA have issued letters reminding the industry practitioners to fulfil their responsibilities by strengthening daily management and preventive measures, and enhancing fire safety awareness and response capabilities among staff and residents. In addition, the REDA will urge its members to actively respond to this call. The Association of Registered Fire Service Installation Contractors has also expressed full support by encouraging the industry to proactively contact owners' organisations and property management companies to implement voluntary fire alarm tests.

The FSD will continue to lead the Inter-departmental Fire Investigation Task Force to investigate the cause of the fire at Wang Fuk Court, including investigation of the FSIs. As the investigation has revealed that the condition of the buildings' FSIs may involve criminal elements, the case is being followed up by the Police."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-12-16 18:37,2025-12-16 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600720.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十二月十六日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗有流行病學關連的新增感染基孔肯雅熱輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

兩宗個案來自同一個家庭，涉及一名44歲女子及一名55歲男子，他們居於深水埗。初步調查顯示，他們於十二月十至十一日一同到訪廣東省揭陽市，並曾在當地郊外環境被蚊子叮咬。女病人在十二月十四日出現關節痛，昨日（十二月十五日）出現發燒，男病人同日出現關節痛及發燒，二人到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫。他們獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他們的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。他們有一名家居接觸者（沒有前往揭陽市），暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。他們沒有其他同行人士。

流行病學調查顯示他們的住所和日常活動範圍與近月的輸入或本地個案沒有重疊的地方。由於病人在潛伏期曾一同到訪廣東省，亦跟香港近期錄得的個案沒有流行病學關連，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案，已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得81宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

政府全方位跟進
———————

因應近期有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。鑑於中心與相關政府部門近期會在該自然徑進行大規模的化學滅蚊及其他防控工作，中心忠告市民不應擅進，以減低感染基孔肯雅熱的風險，同時避免接觸化學劑或妨礙滅蚊工作。

中心繼續呼籲曾在青衣自然徑行山的人士若出現相關病徵，應盡快求醫，並致電設立的查詢熱線（電話：2125 2373）。查詢熱線的運作時間為早上九時至晚上六時。全港醫生及醫院應留意病人是否有相關病徵，並安排相關病人進行血液化驗，中心的公共衞生化驗服務處會提供免費檢測服務。

針對數位患者曾到訪的青衣自然徑一帶，食物環境衞生署（食環署）持續進行密集式霧化處理以殺滅成蚊，在合適的地方使用大型超低微量噴霧器及試用滅蚊機械狗，以提升工作成效。署方亦設置新型捕蚊器、清理可引致積水的棄置容器和垃圾，以及在無法即時處理的積水地方施放蚊油或殺幼蟲劑。食環署已聯同葵青民政事務處、地政總署及渠務署在青衣自然徑加強清除潛在蚊子滋生地，並向該處行山人士派發宣傳單張，呼籲市民提防蚊患及採取個人保護措施。食環署亦舉行跨部門地區滅蚊專責小組會議，討論有關情況的最新發展，並因應需要作出部署，協調各相關部門及持份者在其管轄範圍內加強防蚊滅蚊。

繼續加強防控
——————

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


​上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施

消防處加強巡查並推動業界檢查消防裝置及設備,2025-12-16 18:33,2025-12-16 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600706.htm,"消防處今日（十二月十六日）表示，因應大埔宏福苑火警，處方已於本月四日起與相關物業管理機構保持緊密協作，並加強巡查大廈的消防裝置及設備，以提升樓宇消防安全。

消防處已透過內部調配人手加強巡查大廈的消防裝置及設備，特別針對正在進行大維修的大廈，主動檢查大廈消防警鐘系統運作。處方如發現違規情況，將深入調查並果斷執法。同時，處方已抽調人手迅速跟進大廈的消防裝置異常報告，並按情況採取相應執法行動。

此外，消防處較早前分別與物業管理業監管局（物監局）、香港物業管理公司協會有限公司、香港房屋委員會（房委會）、香港房屋協會（房協）及香港地產建設商會進行深入交流。消防處強調，物業管理公司除須確保大廈依據《消防（裝置及設備）規例》（第95B章）完成年度檢查外，亦應積極履行管理責任，協助業主妥善維護公用部分的消防裝置及設備，確保其持續有效運作。消防處亦提醒物業管理人員須在日常工作中定期巡查消防裝置，並協助業主與業主組織及時處理設備損壞或異常情況。

為消除公眾對消防警鐘效能的疑慮，各持份者同意推動自願性消防警鐘測試，以保障公眾安全。測試內容包括：
• 檢查手動火警鐘掣是否完好並能正常觸發警報；
• 確保消防系統電源穩定，後備電源可靠；以及
• 驗證消防控制板信號傳輸正常，並無誤報或失效。

房委會及房協已安排陸續為轄下公共屋邨及住宅項目進行測試。物監局及香港物業管理公司協會有限公司已向業界發出信件，提醒他們履行相關責任，加強日常管理及預防措施，提升員工與住戶的防火意識及應變能力。此外，香港地產建設商會亦將推動會員積極響應，而香港註冊消防工程公司商會也會全力配合，鼓勵業界主動聯絡業主組織及物業管理公司推行自願性測試。

消防處將繼續率領跨部門調查專組調查宏福苑火警成因，調查範圍包括屋苑的消防裝置及設備。由於調查顯示屋苑的消防裝置及設備情況涉及刑事成分，案件現正由警方跟進。"
HKSAR Government strongly condemns Hong Kong Journalists Association and foreign anti-China media for misleading public and whitewashing Lai Chee-ying,2025-12-16 18:20,2025-12-16 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600693.htm,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government today (December 16) strongly condemned the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) and foreign anti-China media for turning a blind eye to the court's conviction judgment in Lai Chee-ying's case, which was made strictly in accordance with the law and evidence, in an attempt to mislead the public, deliberately whitewash criminal Lai Chee-ying under the cloak of so-called democracy. Their objective is to obscure Lai Chee-ying's shameless acts and subversive work as an agent of external forces to infiltrate and brainwash young people, through manipulating the media to incite the public, the interests of the country and the people.

A HKSAR Government spokesperson said, ""The HKJA has no credibility, lacks recognition and representativeness, and the association has even been refusing to disclose the list of its latest executive committee members. It is despicable for an organisation of such a nature to call itself the representative of the press. In fact, the HKJA, as with other foreign anti-China media outlets, has been intentionally misleading the public by consistently and deliberately conflating the criminal acts in Lai Chee-ying's case with freedom of the press. It has even played up with ill intent different cases to discredit the human rights and rule of law situations of the HKSAR, aiming precisely to confuse the public and smear the HKSAR. These are extremely despicable political manipulations that must be strongly condemned.

""Their misleading and false statements reveal that they have entirely no respect for the HKSAR court's independent judgment of the case, which has been made on the basis of facts and evidence. They also refused to acknowledge the evidence set out in the reasons for the verdict, and refused to understand the court's considerations and rationale for the verdict. Instead, they wantonly launched attacks, slandered and attacked the HKSAR Government, flagrantly trampling the rule of law, overriding the rule of law with politics, distorting facts and confounding right and wrong.""

Court's conviction verdict was entirely free from any political considerations

The spokesperson reiterated, ""The court clearly pointed out in the reasons for verdict that Lai Chee-ying was not on trial for his political views or beliefs. The court's reasons for verdict in this case are 855 pages long, which are fully open for public inspection, and include the court's analysis of the relevant legal principles and evidence, as well as the reasons for convicting Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies in full detail.""

Lai Chee-ying's case has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all

The spokesperson emphasised, ""Lai Chee-ying's case has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all. Over the years, the defendants have used journalism as a guise to commit acts that brought harm to our country and Hong Kong. Lai Chee-ying was fundamentally the mastermind behind a series of anti-China and destabilising activities in Hong Kong, and was no doubt an agent of external anti-China forces. The public trial of this case revealed Lai Chee-ying's close management and hands-on control of the editorial direction of Apple Daily, and one of the senior managers even said they were free within a 'bird cage'.

""Hong Kong citizens enjoy freedom of the press and freedom of speech as protected under the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. In fact, the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of the press, of speech and of publication, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR, are protected in accordance with the law. Like all other places in the world, journalists, just like all other citizens, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. According to the principles established by Article 19 of the ICCPR, the European Convention on Human Rights and relevant jurisprudence, when the media and journalists publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including protection of national security and public order. Journalists must, in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism', act in good faith on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information, so as to be entitled to the protection of freedom of speech and press freedom.

""The HKSAR Government strongly urges the HKJA and other foreign anti-China media to understand the facts relating to Lai Chee-ying's case as soon as possible, and do the right thing to stop any form of infiltration and activities of a subversive nature, including 'brainwashing' young people of the HKSAR for external forces. The HKSAR Government will absolutely not condone any acts endangering national security that incite the public to betray the interests of the country and the people."""

十二月份第二批涵蓋27個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數及五個監察地區的分區誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

食環署至今已公布二○二五年十二月共兩批白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數，涵蓋共48個監察地區。與上月（即二○二五年十一月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這48個監察區中，46個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有兩區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

白紋伊蚊的卵能長時間抵禦乾旱的環境，當遇到合適的溫度和接觸水時，便會孵化。市民在冬季仍須採取防治蚊蟲措施，徹底清除蚊卵。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和清倒盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐；及
最少每星期一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公報、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為了讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

At the meeting, the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau briefed members on the Government's manpower planning and strategies for the arts, culture and creative industries. It reported that the Government endeavours to nurture local talent through providing professional and continuous training to industry practitioners of different levels. Meanwhile, the Government attracts high-end Mainland and overseas talent and continues to add new impetus to the local arts and culture industries. Members were pleased to learn that the Government is actively developing world-class cultural facilities, and continuously enhancing the ecosystem of the arts, culture and creative industries, thereby providing practitioners with a supportive environment and ample opportunities for creative development. Members supported the Government's continuous efforts to promote the development of the arts, culture and creative industries to attract talent from home and abroad, further consolidating Hong Kong's status as an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange.

Members were also briefed on the further enhancement measures of the Technology Talent Admission Scheme (TechTAS) by the Innovation and Technology Commission (ITC). To expedite the admission of innovation and technology (I&T) talent to undertake research and development work in Hong Kong, the ITC will further enhance TechTAS to (1) streamline application procedures to allow technology companies and eligible talent to submit applications for quotas and visas/entry permits in parallel, (2) lift the requirement of engaging in research and development in 14 designated technology areas to better address the ever-changing I&T development, and (3) launch a new dedicated application channel for the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park to provide one-stop assistance to their tenants and incubatees in application and subsequent follow-up. The ITC and the Immigration Department expect to launch the enhancement measures within this month. Members welcomed the further enhancements to TechTAS, anticipating that these initiatives will contribute to attracting a greater number of I&T talent, with a view to enlarging the I&T talent pool of Hong Kong."

  Among the second batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 27 survey areas and Area Gravidtrap Indexes covering five survey areas in December, all were below 10 per cent.

  The FEHD has so far released two batches of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in December 2025, covering 48 survey areas. Among these 48 survey areas, 46 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. November 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Two other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

  The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.

  Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.


  Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

  Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

Motorists can travel to and from Tsim Sha Tsui, the Western Harbour Crossing, Tai Kok Tsui or Kwai Chung via Hoi Po Road, West Kowloon Highway and Lin Cheung Road. At the Kai Tak end, the eight entrances and exits enable motorists to travel to and from Kai Tak, Kowloon Bay, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal or Kwun Tong via Shing Kai Road, Kai Cheung Road and Kai Fuk Road (see details in Annex 1). Upon its commissioning, it will divert the traffic along the existing major east-west corridors in Kowloon and alleviate the traffic congestion during peak hours.

  Appropriate traffic signs and road markings have been put in place on relevant road sections to guide motorists to enter and exit the Bypass for various destinations. The TD appealed to motorists to heed traffic signs on-site and drive carefully when passing through road sections concerned, and reduce speed and be courteous when approaching the new merging points.

Public transport arrangements

  From December 22 (Monday), the first working day upon commissioning, a total of eight bus routes, comprising three new routes and adjusting five existing routes, will provide services via the CKB (YMT Section) during peak hours on Mondays to Fridays (except public holidays):




Three new routes via Bypass
Adjusting five existing routes to run through Bypass




KMB route No. 33X (Tsuen Wan West Station -Yau Tong)
KMB route No. 252S (Handsome Court -Kwun Tong Ferry)
Citybus route No. A28X (Tseung Kwan O Station to Airport (Ground Transportation Centre))




KMB route No. 258X (Po Tin -Kwun Tong Ferry)
KMB route No. 259S (Lung Mun Oasis -Kwun Tong Ferry)
KMB route No. 259X (Lung Mun Oasis -Kwun Tong Ferry)
KMB route No. 268P (Ma Wang Road -Kwun Tong Ferry)
KMB route No. 269S (Tin Shui Wai Town Centre -Kwun Tong Ferry)






  The above franchised bus routes plying via the CKB (YMT Section) will provide convenience for passengers across various districts. While journey times of travelling between East and West Kowloon will be significantly shortened, as the Bypass connects with the West Kowloon Highway, travelling times of long-haul bus routes operating between East Kowloon and New Territories West (including Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Tsuen Wan) will be substantially reduced, improving their efficiency.

  In the initial period upon the commissioning of the CKB (YMT Section), as motorists may take time to adapt to new road sections, it is anticipated that traffic may be busier during various periods. The TD urged motorists to refer to the driving videos of different driving routes set out in the driving guide and the TD's YouTube channel playlist, and choose appropriate routes for their journeys subject to actual traffic conditions.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""The Emergency Transport Co-ordination Centre will closely monitor the traffic condition of the CKB (YMT Section) upon commissioning, including the traffic flow and public transport services of road sections connecting the existing road network and trunk roads across the territory. Motorists, transport trades and the public should plan ahead their journeys, and reserve time to adapt to new routes and adjust their commuting habits.""

  The TD also reminds passengers to refer to the notices, websites or mobile apps of bus operators to take note of the new arrangements of the routes plying via the CKB (YMT Section), as well as their bus stop locations and service hours. The TD has steered bus operators to closely monitor the operations of these routes and reserve standby vehicles and manpower to meet passenger demand. The TD will continue to proactively discuss with bus operators any additional routes or adjustment to existing ones to make better use of the capacity of the Bypass for the benefit of more passengers.

  The Government has briefed District Councils concerned and stakeholders on the above arrangements, including distributing pamphlets to District Council members, district personalities, neighbouring housing estates and schools, relevant motoring associations and public transport operators on various driving routes. The Highways Department and the TD have stepped up publicity since December to remind motorists about the new arrangements via large banners, tunnel broadcasts, variable message signs on major roads and electronic parking meters in the districts in phases.

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's webpage on CKB (YMT Section) and the HKeMobility mobile app for details of the traffic and transport arrangements. They should also heed the latest traffic news through radio and TV broadcasts, the TD's website (www.td.gov.hk) and the HKeMobility."
中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後交通及公共運輸安排（附圖／短片）,2025-12-16 16:45,2025-12-16 17:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600272.htm,"運輸署今日（十二月十六日）表示，中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後，將實施相應交通及公共運輸安排。

交通安排

中九龍繞道（油麻地段）連接西九龍的油麻地交匯處與東九龍的啟德交匯處。油麻地設有七個出入口，駕駛人士可經海寶路、西九龍公路及連翔道來往尖沙咀、西區海底隧道、大角咀或葵涌；啟德則設有八個出入口，讓駕駛者經承啟道、啟祥道及啟福道往返啟德、九龍灣、啟德郵輪碼頭或觀塘（詳見附件一）。繞道開通後將能分流九龍現有東西行主要幹道的車流，紓緩繁忙時間的交通擠塞。

有關路段已加設適當交通標誌及道路標記，指示駕駛人士使用合適道路進出繞道及前往不同目的地。運輸署呼籲駕駛者駛經有關路段時留意現場的交通標誌及小心駕駛，並在駛近新增的交通匯合點時減慢車速及保持禮讓。

公共運輸安排

由通車後的首個工作天即十二月二十二日（星期一）起，共有八條專營巴士路線途經繞道，包括新增三條路線途經繞道，以及調整現有五條路線改經繞道，全部均於星期一至五（公眾假期除外）繁忙時段提供服務：




新增三條路線途經繞道
調整現有五條路線改經繞道




九巴第33X號線（荃灣西站—油塘）
九巴第252S號線（恆順園—觀塘碼頭）
城巴第A28X號線（將軍澳站往機場（地面運輸中心））




九巴第258X號線（寶田—觀塘碼頭）
九巴第259S號線（龍門居—觀塘碼頭）
九巴第259X號線（龍門居—觀塘碼頭）
九巴第268P號線（媽橫路—觀塘碼頭）
九巴第269S號線（天水圍市中心—觀塘碼頭）






上述行經中九龍繞道（油麻地段）的專營巴士路線將便利多區乘客，既大幅縮短來往東西九龍的行車時間，亦因繞道連接西九龍公路而大幅縮短來往東九龍及新界西（如屯門、元朗和荃灣）長途巴士線的時間，提升效率。

中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車初期，預期駕駛人士需時適應新路段，部分時段的交通可能會較繁忙。運輸署呼籲駕駛者，參閱駕駛指南或運輸署YouTube頻道播放清單中各行車路線的駕駛短片，因應實際交通情況，選擇合適路線。

運輸署發言人說：「緊急事故交通協調中心會密切監察中九龍繞道（油麻地段）通車後的交通情況，包括與現有道路網接駁的路段以至港九新界主幹道的車流和公共運輸服務情況。駕駛人士、運輸業界和市民應提早計劃行程，預留時間適應新路線和調整出行模式。」

署方亦提醒乘客參閱巴士公司通告、網頁或流動應用程式，及早了解新安排下行經繞道的路線、車站位置及服務時間。署方已督導巴士公司密切留意有關路線的運作情況，並預留後備車輛和人手，應對乘客需求。署方會繼續與巴士公司積極商討新增或調整現有路線，善用繞道的承載力，讓更多乘客受惠。

政府已向相關區議會及持份者簡介上述安排，包括向區議員、地區人士、鄰近屋苑和學校、相關車會、公共運輸服務營辦商等派發小冊子，介紹各行車路線。路政署與運輸署自本月起已加強宣傳，陸續透過大型提示橫額、隧道廣播、主要道路可變信息顯示屏、區內電子停車收費錶等提醒駕駛人士注意新安排。

市民可參閲運輸署中九龍繞道（油麻地段）專頁及「香港出行易」流動應用程式了解交通運輸安排詳情，並留意電台、電視台、運輸署網頁（www.td.gov.hk）及「香港出行易」的最新交通消息。"

香港海關經情報分析及風險評估，鎖定一艘遠洋船並懷疑不法份子利用其船底結構收藏毒品，遂部署行動。香港海關人員於十一月五日對該艘從巴西抵港的目標船隻進行水底查驗，並在其船底吸水口內發現十一袋、共重約四百一十七公斤的懷疑可卡因。跟進調查後，香港海關在青衣拘捕兩名年齡分別為四十五歲及三十七歲的懷疑涉案男子。

兩名被捕男子暫已獲釋候查。案件仍在調查中，不排除有更多人被捕。

聖誕及新年假期將至，香港海關會於長假期前夕進一步加強執法，嚴厲打擊各類販毒活動。

根據《危險藥物條例》，販運危險藥物屬嚴重罪行，一經定罪，最高可被判罰款五百萬元及終身監禁。

市民可致電香港海關二十四小時熱線182 8080，或透過舉報罪案專用電郵帳戶（crimereport@customs.gov.hk）或網上表格（eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002）舉報懷疑販毒活動。"

Hong Kong Customs detects first drug trafficking case involving underwater compartment of ocean-going vessel and seizes suspected cocaine worth about $256 million (with photo),2025-12-16 16:45,2025-12-16 17:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600496.htm,"âHong Kong Customs, in a joint operation with Mainland Customs anti-smuggling departments, the Hong Kong Police Force and the Fire Services Department, detected its first drug trafficking case where an underwater compartment of an ocean-going vessel was used for drug concealment. During the operation on November 5 in Tsing Yi, Hong Kong Customs officers seized about 417 kilograms of suspected cocaine with an estimated market value about $256 million and arrested two men.

Through intelligence analysis and risk assessment, Hong Kong Customs identified an ocean-going vessel and suspected that criminals were utilising its underwater hull structure to conceal drugs, and thereby formulated enforcement actions. On November 5, the ocean-going vessel that departed from Brazil was selected for underwater inspection, and 11 bags of suspected cocaine, weighing about 417kg in total, were found in an underwater compartment. After a follow-up investigation, Hong Kong Customs officers arrested two men, aged 45 and 37, who were suspected of being involved in the case in Tsing Yi.

The two arrested men have been released pending further investigation. The investigation is ongoing and the likelihood of further arrests is not ruled out.

With the Christmas and New Year holidays approaching, Hong Kong Customs will step up enforcement action to resolutely combat different kinds of drug trafficking activities before the long holidays.

Under the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, trafficking in a dangerous drug is a serious offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and life imprisonment.

Members of the public may report any suspected drug trafficking activities to Hong Kong Customs' 24-hour report hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."

二零二五年九月至十一月失業及就業不足統計數字,2025-12-16 16:30,2025-12-16 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600295.htm,"根據政府統計處今日（十二月十六日）發表的最新勞動人口統計數字（即二零二五年九月至十一月的臨時數字），二零二五年九月至十一月經季節性調整的失業率為3.8%，與二零二五年八月至十月的數字相同。就業不足率在該兩段期間亦保持不變，維持於1.6%的水平。

與二零二五年八月至十月比較，在二零二五年九月至十一月期間，各行業的失業率（不經季節性調整）及就業不足率變動不一，但幅度普遍不大。

總就業人數由二零二五年八月至十月的3 672 700人，下跌至二零二五年九月至十一月的3 669 900人，減少約2 800人。同期的總勞動人口亦由3 822 300人下跌至3 814 300人，減少約8 000人。

失業人數（不經季節性調整）由二零二五年八月至十月的149 600人下跌至二零二五年九月至十一月的144 400人，減少約5 200人。就業不足人數方面，二零二五年九月至十一月的數字為60 900人，與二零二五年八月至十月的數字（60 800人）大致相若。

評論

勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡評論最新失業數字時表示：「二零二五年九月至十一月經季節性調整的失業率維持在3.8%，與上一個三個月期間相同。就業不足率亦維持在1.6%不變。同期勞動人口和總就業人數稍為下跌，失業人數亦進一步減少。」

展望未來，孫玉菡說：「香港經濟穩健擴張，加上消費信心有所改善，應會繼續為整體勞工市場帶來支持。然而，一些行業的就業情況或仍會因其業務面對挑戰而承受壓力。」

進一步資料

失業和就業不足的統計數字，是根據持續進行的「綜合住戶統計調查」結果而編製。

統計調查所採用有關失業及就業不足的定義，緊隨國際勞工組織的建議。當中，就業人口涵蓋所有僱主、自營作業者、僱員（包括全職、兼職及散工等）和無酬家庭從業員。而按行業（或職業）劃分的失業人士是按其以前從事的行業（或職業）劃分。

二零二五年九月至十一月的統計調查所用的樣本，是通過一個根據科學方法設計的抽樣系統選出，包括約26 000個住戶，共約69 000人，以代表本港人口的情況。根據這個樣本編製而成的勞工統計數字反映二零二五年九月至十一月的移動三個月期間的情況。

統計調查是向樣本中各住戶內每名15歲或以上的成員進行訪問，以搜集有關勞動人口特徵的資料。

載列最新勞工統計數字的統計表可於政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/scode200.html）下載。有關勞動人口特徵的詳細分析則刊載於每年出版四次的《綜合住戶統計調查按季統計報告》。最新一期的報告載列二零二五年七月至九月的統計數字，而涵蓋二零二五年十月至十二月的一期將於二零二六年二月底出版。用戶亦可在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1050001&scode=200）瀏覽及下載。

該刊物載列於二零二四年四月至八月期間進行的主題性住戶統計調查所得，關於執行贍養令的情況的主要結果。

統計調查結果顯示，在統計時有432 300名16歲及以上人士曾經離婚／分居，佔香港所有16歲及以上人士的6.9%。須注意，由於部分目標受訪者可能不願意透露他們曾經離婚／分居，因此曾經離婚／分居人士的數目可能被低估。數據使用者須小心闡釋有關數字。

在該432 300名曾經離婚／分居人士中，大部分（344 500人或79.7%）既無申請也不打算申請贍養令，當中10 900人已與前配偶有贍養費協議收取贍養費；其餘333 600人最普遍提及沒此安排的原因是「沒有需要」（44.2%）。另一方面，83 500人（19.3%）在統計時已向法庭申請贍養令，而4 300人（1.0%）打算申請。

在該83 500名有申請贍養令的曾經離婚／分居人士中，絕大部分（77 900人或93.3%）成功獲取贍養令，而3.4%則未能成功，餘下的3.3%未有結果。加上10 900人已與前配偶有贍養費協議收取贍養費，在統計時共有88 800名曾經離婚／分居人士收取贍養費。

上述88 800名人士中，35 200人象徵式收取前配偶1元的贍養費或仍在等待法庭判決贍養費支付方式。其餘53 600名收取贍養費的曾經離婚／分居人士中，五成以上（51.8%）表示已全數收取贍養費（包括以一次過方式收取或在統計前12個月內有按時以定期方式收取）。

其他資料

該項統計調查根據一個以科學方法設計的抽樣系統，成功訪問約10 100個住戶內的目標訪問對象，以代表本港人口的情況。

Unemployment and underemployment statistics for September - November 2025,2025-12-16 16:30,2025-12-16 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600299.htm,"According to the latest labour force statistics (i.e. provisional figures for September - November 2025) released today (December 16) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD), the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in September - November 2025, same as that in August - October 2025. The underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.6% in the two periods.

Comparing September - November 2025 with August - October 2025, movements in the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) and underemployment rate in different industry sectors varied, but the magnitudes were generally not large.

Total employment decreased by around 2 800 from 3 672 700 in August - October 2025 to 3 669 900 in September - November 2025. Over the same period, the labour force also decreased by around 8 000 from 3 822 300 to 3 814 300.

The number of unemployed persons (not seasonally adjusted) decreased by around 5 200 from 149 600 in August - October 2025 to 144 400 in September - November 2025. The number of underemployed persons in September - November 2025 was 60 900, about the same as that in August - October 2025 (60 800).

Commentary

Commenting on the latest unemployment figures, the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, said, ""The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at 3.8% in September - November 2025, same as that in the preceding three-month period. The underemployment rate also remained unchanged at 1.6%. Over the same period, the labour force and total employment decreased slightly, and the number of unemployed persons also decreased further.""

Looking ahead, Mr Chris Sun said, ""The solid expansion of the Hong Kong economy and the improving consumer confidence should continue to render support to the overall labour market. Yet, the employment situations in some sectors may remain under pressure as their businesses face challenges.""

Further information

The unemployment and underemployment statistics were compiled from the findings of the continuous General Household Survey.

In the survey, the definitions used in measuring unemployment and underemployment follow closely those recommended by the International Labour Organization. The employed population covers all employers, self-employed persons, employees (including full-time, part-time, casual workers, etc.) and unpaid family workers. Unemployed persons by industry (or occupation) are classified according to their previous industry (or occupation).

The survey for September - November 2025 covered a sample of some 26 000 households or 69 000 persons, selected in accordance with a scientifically designed sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong. Labour force statistics compiled from this sample represented the situation in the moving three-month period of September to November 2025.

Data on labour force characteristics were obtained from the survey by interviewing each member aged 15 or over in the sampled households.

Statistical tables on the latest labour force statistics can be downloaded at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/scode200.html). More detailed analysis of the labour force characteristics is given in the ""Quarterly Report on General Household Survey"" which is published four times a year. The latest issue of the report contains statistics for the quarter July - September 2025 while the next issue covering the quarter October - December 2025 will be available by end February 2026. Users can also browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1050001&scode=200).

This publication contains key findings on enforcement of maintenance orders based on the Thematic Household Survey conducted from April to August 2024.

The survey results showed that 432 300 persons aged 16 and over had ever been divorced/separated at the time of enumeration, constituting 6.9% of all persons aged 16 and over in Hong Kong. It should be noted that the number of persons who had ever been divorced/separated might be subject to under-reporting because some of the target respondents may not be willing to reveal that they had ever been divorced/separated. Data users are reminded to interpret the related figures with caution.

Of the 432 300 ever divorced/separated persons, the majority (344 500 persons or 79.7%) had neither applied nor intended to apply for a maintenance order, of whom 10 900 persons had a maintenance agreement with their ex-spouse for receiving maintenance. The most commonly cited reason for the remaining 333 600 persons not doing so was ""no such need"" (44.2%). On the other hand, 83 500 persons (19.3%) had applied for a maintenance order from the court at the time of enumeration, while 4 300 persons (1.0%) intended to do so.

Among the 83 500 ever divorced/separated persons who had applied for a maintenance order, the great majority (77 900 persons or 93.3%) were successful in obtaining the maintenance order, while 3.4% were not successful. Results for the remaining 3.3% were not yet known. Coupled with 10 900 persons who had a maintenance agreement with their ex-spouse for receiving maintenance, there were 88 800 ever divorced/separated persons receiving maintenance at the time of enumeration.

Among the abovementioned 88 800 persons, there were 35 200 persons receiving a nominal maintenance of $1 from their ex-spouse or awaiting the court's ruling on the mode of maintenance payment. More than half (51.8%) of the remaining 53 600 ever divorced/separated persons receiving maintenance were able to receive the maintenance payment in full, including those who had received a lump sum maintenance payment or periodic maintenance payments on time during the 12 months before enumeration.

Other information

The survey successfully enumerated target respondents in some 10 100 households in accordance with a scientific sampling scheme to represent the population of Hong Kong.

Detailed findings of the survey, together with the population coverage and concepts/definitions of key terms, are presented in the publication. Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1130201&scode=453).

Communications Authority grants consent to CMHK to cease its 2G services,2025-12-16 16:25,2025-12-16 16:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600336.htm," The Office of the Communications Authority (OFCA) announced today (December 16) the Communications Authority (CA)'s decision to grant prior consent to China Mobile Hong Kong Company Limited (CMHK) for its application to cease the provision of second generation mobile (2G) services on June 23, 2026.

 Having considered various relevant factors, the CA approved the application pursuant to Special Condition 10.4 of CMHK's Unified Carrier Licence. These include the very low proportion of customers affected (including customers of 2G pre-paid services, those who are still using 2G handsets/devices for connection to CMHK's network and those using handsets/devices that do not support VoLTE (Note) function), and CMHK's provision of support services for the affected customers such as offers to upgrade service plans or to replace handsets/devices. For customers who choose not to continue the service or not to replace their handsets/devices, CMHK will make reasonable service termination arrangements and provide them with sufficient advance notification and customer service support. Moreover, the CA has required CMHK to maintain satisfactory 2G services until the scheduled service cessation date.

 CMHK is the last operator to shut down its 2G mobile network and will cease the provision of its 2G services on June 23, 2026. Affected customers may refer to the relevant press release issued by CMHK today or contact the company for details of the arrangements.

  After the phased shutdown of 2G mobile networks by individual mobile network operators, June 23, 2026, will mark the end of the 2G era in Hong Kong. OFCA takes this opportunity to call for customers of 2G services and those who are still using 2G handsets/devices to upgrade their service plans and handsets/devices before June 23, 2026, to ensure the continuity of their mobile services. OFCA also encourages members of the public to assist their family and friends, especially the elderly, in upgrading their services in order to experience better service quality and more advanced and diversified features provided by the newer generations of mobile services.

Note: VoLTE, which stands forVoice over Long Term Evolution (LTE), isa technology that enables voice calls to be made over a 4G LTE network instead of older 2G or 3G networks."

尊敬的鄭翔玲會長（香港中華聯誼會會長）、陳國基署理行政長官、羅永綱副主任（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室副主任）、李永勝副特派員（外交部駐香港特別行政區特派員公署副特派員）、王志學副主任（中國人民解放軍駐香港部隊政治工作部副主任）、馬時亨主席（香港貿易發展局主席）、林建岳主席（香港旅遊發展局主席）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

大家下午好！我很高興再次參與由香港中華聯誼會主辦的「2025科技+新質生產力高峰論壇」。

近日召開的中央經濟工作會議，明確將建設粵港澳大灣區國際科技創新中心列為明年的重點任務之一。近年來，特區政府全速推進香港國際創科中心發展，我們會以三大創科園區、五大研發機構為主體架構，促進上、中、下游協同發展。我們亦扶持了近500家具潛力或引領性的創科企業在港發展，積極構建香港的創科產業體系。我們將陸續推動河套以及北部都會區的創科建設，加強及深化香港在創科發展上的布局。

一、河套香港園區

河套香港園區是國家新質生產力的重要策源地。第一期首三座大樓包括兩座濕實驗室大樓與一座人才公寓已經落成，我們正以「邊建設、邊進駐」發展模式全速推進其餘五座大樓的建設，將於二○二七年起陸續落成。經過一年多的加速推進及籌備，河套香港園區開園在即。目前，近60家企業已經與園區簽約並正在入駐。此外，我們正積極與內地相關單位緊密磋商，制定相關的執行方案，讓人流、物流、資金流及數據流等創新要素在深港兩個園區跨境便捷流動，讓河套園區的創新發展更具活力和突破。

二、新田科技城

新田科技城是驅動北部都會區發展的重要引擎，將以提供原型和中試、量產空間，發展本地優質創科產業，以及匯聚全球創科資源和人才作為新田科技城的三大戰略定位。新田科技城的三個產業發展帶主要聚焦發展生命健康科技、人工智能與機械人，以及微電子與先進製造。未來，河套香港園區將會更專注前沿科技創新與中試，而新田科技城則承接河套園區的成果轉化工作並作產業發展。新田科技城與河套香港園區協同發展，將會引領香港乃至大灣區的高質量發展。

三、沙嶺國際數據園區

人工智能正以前所未有的發展速度重塑全球經濟和產業發展格局。香港亦因應時勢，確立人工智能為關鍵產業。發展人工智能極需要數據與算力等關鍵要素支撐，面對不斷上漲的算力需求以及日益加劇的全球算力競爭，我們必須發展新的算力設施，以維持人工智能發展的核心競爭力。我們將會把北面的沙嶺發展定位為國際數據園區，期望能夠帶動區內人工智能和數據產業發展，推進香港國際數據港建設和響應國家「人工智能＋」行動。

女士們、先生們，國家「十五五」規劃建議明確支持香港建設國際創新科技中心。我相信在有為政府、高效市場的有機結合以及政、產、學、研、投的高效協作下，香港的創科發展定會越加蓬勃，為國家高水平科技自立自強作出香港貢獻。

謝謝大家！"

香港與挪威簽訂稅務協定（附圖）,2025-12-16 15:42,2025-12-16 16:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600281.htm,"​財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（十二月十六日）在北京與挪威駐華大使戴偉恩進行雙邊會議，並代表香港特別行政區（特區）政府與挪威王國政府簽署全面性避免雙重課稅協定。

許正宇說：「挪威是香港在北歐重要的貿易夥伴。今年六月我專程前赴挪威與其財政部商討盡早簽訂兩地的協定，挪威當局積極回應，因而促成半年後的今日雙方正式簽署協定。這份協定闡明兩地的徵稅權，讓投資者更有效評估其跨境經濟活動的潛在稅務負擔及避免雙重課稅，我預期會為兩地締造更具吸引力的營商環境。」

「特區政府一直致力推動國際稅務合作並取得豐碩成果。單是今年，我們便與約旦、馬爾代夫、挪威和盧旺達簽訂了合共四份協定，今日與挪威簽訂的正是香港第55份協定，充分體現香港持續拓展協定網絡的努力。」

按照這份協定，香港居民在挪威繳付的稅項均可根據《稅務條例》（第112章）抵免香港就同一筆收入所徵收的稅項。此外，挪威向香港居民徵收股息的預扣稅稅率將由現時最高25%降至5%或15%（視乎其控股的百分比而定）。

協定將在雙方完成有關批准程序後生效。就香港而言，行政長官會同行政會議會根據《稅務條例》就協定作出一項命令，並以先訂立後審議程序提交立法會省覽。協定詳情載於稅務局網頁。

他補充說：「今年訪問斯洛文尼亞和波蘭期間，我亦與兩國財金高層官員就磋商協定取得共識。特區政府會繼續深化與其他國家及地區的稅務合作，進一步提升香港作為國際商業及投資樞紐的吸引力。我們已計劃明年初與斯洛文尼亞和阿曼就協定展開磋商。另一方面，香港積極支持國際社會就提升稅務透明度和打擊逃稅的工作也獲得肯定，今年早前已成功獲智利、哥倫比亞及葡萄牙從其『稅務黑名單』剔除。」

在今日的雙邊會議上，許正宇向戴偉恩闡述了香港作為國際金融及貿易中心的優勢，並探討兩地在金融領域，包括海事金融、綠色金融和財富管理等的合作空間。

他訪京期間也拜會了國家財政部，就明年十月在港舉行的二○二六年亞太區經濟合作組織財政部長會議商討籌備事宜。由國家財政部主辦的財政部長會議將以特區政府承辦的方式在港舉行，許正宇主持的專責工作組負責統籌會議策劃和籌備等相關工作。

許正宇將於今日傍晚返港。"
Hong Kong and Norway enter into tax pact (with photos),2025-12-16 15:42,2025-12-16 16:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600284.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, had a bilateral meeting with the Ambassador of Norway to China, Mr Vebjørn Dysvik, in Beijing today (December 16) and signed on behalf of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government a comprehensive avoidance of double taxation agreement (CDTA) with the Government of the Kingdom of Norway.

Mr Hui said, ""Norway is an important trading partner of Hong Kong in Northern Europe. This June, I travelled to Norway specifically to discuss with their Ministry of Finance the early conclusion of the CDTA between our two jurisdictions. The Norwegian authorities responded positively, which led to the formal signing of the agreement today, just six months after the trip. The CDTA sets out the allocation of taxing rights between Hong Kong and Norway, which will enable investors to better assess their potential tax liabilities from cross-border economic activities and enjoy avoidance of double taxation. It is envisaged that this CDTA will create a more attractive business environment for the two places.

  ""The HKSAR Government has been committed to promoting international tax co-operation and has achieved significant results. Just this year, we signed a total of four CDTAs with Jordan, Maldives, Norway and Rwanda. The agreement signed today with Norway marks Hong Kong's 55th CDTA, fully reflecting Hong Kong's ongoing efforts in expanding its CDTA network.""

In accordance with this CDTA, any tax paid by Hong Kong residents in Norway will be allowed as a credit against the tax payable in Hong Kong in respect of the same income, subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) (IRO). Moreover, Norway's withholding tax rate for Hong Kong residents on dividends, currently at up to 25 per cent, will be reduced to 5 per cent or 15 per cent, depending on the percentage of their shareholdings.

The CDTA will come into force after completion of ratification procedures by both sides. In Hong Kong, the Chief Executive in Council will make an order under the IRO, which will be tabled at the Legislative Council for negative vetting. Details of the CDTA are available on the Inland Revenue Department's website.

Mr Hui added, ""During my visits to Slovenia and Poland this year, I also reached consensus with senior financial officials of both countries on CDTA negotiations. The HKSAR Government will continue to deepen tax co-operation with other countries and regions, thereby further enhancing Hong Kong's attractiveness as an international business and investment hub. We plan to commence CDTA negotiations with Slovenia and Oman early next year. In addition, Hong Kong's active participation in international efforts to enhance tax transparency and combat tax evasion has been well-recognised. Earlier this year, Hong Kong was successfully removed from the respective 'tax blacklists' of Chile, Colombia and Portugal.""

At today's bilateral meeting, Mr Hui highlighted to Mr Dysvik the strengths of Hong Kong as an international financial and commercial centre, and explored co-operation opportunities between the two sides in the financial sector, including maritime finance, green finance and wealth management.

During his stay in Beijing, Mr Hui also called on the Ministry of Finance to discuss the preparatory work for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Finance Ministers' Meeting (FMM) 2026 to be held in Hong Kong in October next year. Hosted by the Ministry of Finance, the FMM will be held in Hong Kong under the arrangements and organisation of the HKSAR Government. A dedicated task force led by Mr Hui is responsible for co-ordinating relevant planning and preparatory work.

Mr Hui will return to Hong Kong this evening."

大家好。今天我很榮幸出席「2025科技+新質生產力高峰論壇」，跟大家分享特區政府如何透過政策布局，抓緊無限機遇，進一步推動香港創科產業發展，積極推動香港融入國家發展大局，為國家高質量發展作出貢獻。

當前，國家正全面推進高質量發展，加快發展新質生產力。香港在「一國兩制」下擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢，特區政府積極對接國家戰略，以創新科技作為推動經濟發展的重要引擎。

我們的創科布局以「三大創科園區、五大研發機構」為主體，旨在貫通上、中、下游的協同發展，打造完整的創新生態。除了科學園和數碼港持續發展，河套深港科技創新合作區的香港園區即將啓用，配合最近公布的《新田科技城創科產業發展規劃概念綱要》，將進一步強化香港作為國際創科中心的定位。

在研發體系方面，我們正全力重塑公營科研機構的布局，聚焦國家與香港重點發展的前沿科技領域。除了現有的香港生產力促進局和香港應用科技研究院，我們去年成立了香港微電子研發院，致力與大學、研發中心和業界攜手，研發第三代半導體等關鍵技術，並會推動科研成果產業化。

此外，我們正積極推進設立生命健康研發院，促進跨院校、跨學科的科研合作，吸引海內外高端人才匯聚香港，助力大灣區建設成為人才高地。

我們也將於二○二六年成立香港人工智能研發院，引導及助力人工智能技術的創新和應用，為經濟社會發展注入智能動力。

國家「十五五」規劃明確支持香港建設國際創科中心。我們會充分發揮香港「內聯外通」的橋樑角色，吸引具備前沿技術與高階科研能力的企業落戶香港，不斷壯大本地創科生態圈。

截至今年十月底，已經有接近500家具潛力或領先地位的創科企業計劃來港發展、落戶或擴展在香港的業務。我們相信，未來將有更多企業與香港攜手，共同培育新質生產力，貢獻國家科技自立自強。

各位朋友，香港的創科發展需要大家共同努力。特區政府會繼續完善創科政策體系，為香港的經濟注入高質量發展的新動力。我期待各位集思廣益，共同為香港創科開拓更廣闊的空間，讓香港創科發展更上一層樓，為國家現代化建設貢獻更多香港力量。

  ""A total of 221 approved PVRMs will be put up for public auction. A list of the marks has been uploaded to the department's website, www.td.gov.hk/en/public_services/vehicle_registration_mark/index.html,"" a department spokesman said.

  The reserve price of each of these marks is $5,000. Applicants who have paid a deposit of $5,000 should also participate in the bidding (including the first bid at the reserve price). Otherwise, the PVRM concerned may be sold to another bidder at the reserve price.

  People who wish to participate in the bidding at the auction should take note of the following points:

(1) Bidders are required to produce the following documents for completion of registration and payment procedures immediately after a successful bidding:

(i) the identity document of the successful bidder;
(ii) the identity document of the purchaser (if the purchaser and the successful bidder are different persons);
(iii) a copy of the Certificate of Incorporation (if the purchaser is a body corporate); and
(iv) a crossed cheque made payable to ""The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region"" or ""The Government of the HKSAR"". For an auctioned mark paid for by cheque, the first three working days after the date of auction will be required for cheque clearance confirmation before processing of the application for mark assignment can be completed. Successful bidders may also pay through the Easy Pay System (EPS), but are reminded to note the maximum transfer amount in the same day of the payment card. Payment by post-dated cheque, cash, credit card or other methods will not be accepted.

(2) Purchasers must make payment of the purchase price through EPS or by crossed cheque and complete the Memorandum of Sale of PVRM immediately after the bidding. Subsequent alteration of the particulars in the Memorandum will not be permitted.

(3) A PVRM can only be assigned to a motor vehicle which is registered in the name of the purchaser. The Certificate of Incorporation must be produced immediately by the purchaser if a vehicle registration mark purchased is to be registered under the name of a body corporate.

(4) The display of a PVRM on a motor vehicle should be in compliance with the requirements stipulated in Schedule 4 of the Road Traffic (Registration and Licensing of Vehicles) Regulations.

(5) Any change to the arrangement of letters, numerals and blank spaces of a PVRM, i.e. single and two rows as auctioned, will not be allowed.

(6) The purchaser shall, within 12 months after the date of auction, apply to the Commissioner for Transport for the PVRM to be assigned to a motor vehicle registered in the name of the purchaser. If the purchaser fails to assign the PVRM within 12 months, allocation of the PVRM will be cancelled and arranged for reallocation in accordance with the statutory provision without prior notice to the purchaser.

  ""Upon completion of the Memorandum of Sale of PVRM, the purchaser will be issued a receipt and a Certificate of Allocation of Personalised Registration Mark. The Certificate of Allocation will serve to prove the holdership of the PVRM. Potential buyers of vehicles bearing a PVRM should check the Certificate of Allocation with the sellers and pay attention to the details therein. For transfer of vehicle ownership, this certificate together with other required documents should be sent to the TD for processing,"" the spokesman added.

The CSD has introduced a trial run of this video visit service to declared visitors of PICs at different correctional institutions in phases since November 11 this year. Positive responses have been received since then as the service offers visitors a more convenient and people-oriented visiting experience.

The CSD emphasised that the video visit service aims to bring convenience to the public by providing them with an additional option. Visitors can still pay physical visits to correctional institutions according to their actual needs.

Applications will be accepted from today.
  
  The Chief Executive proposed in the 2025 Policy Address to step up efforts to promote digital education in primary and secondary schools, and announced that the EDB has set aside $2 billion in the Quality Education Fund (QEF) to advance the relevant support measures proposed by the Steering Committee on Strategic Development of Digital Education (SCSDDE). This will help Hong Kong's education embrace the opportunities of the AI era and achieve the goal of ""AI for ALL subjects"", where teachers utilise AI effectively to support teaching across subjects.
  
  The Chairperson of the SCSDDE and Under Secretary for Education, Dr Sze Chun-fai, said, ""The EDB is determined to make AI the core driving force behind digital transformation in schools, and support primary and secondary schools in utilising AI to enhance learning and teaching effectiveness. In this connection, within the $2 billion earmarked under the QEF, the EDB allocates approximately $500 million to launch the three-year programme starting from this school year. Schools can flexibly utilise the funding to initiate and promote school-based programmes that use AI to empower education, catering for their specific circumstances and developmental needs.""
  
  He continued, ""Successful school applicants will receive one-off funding of $500,000. Schools can utilise the funding according to the guidelines to purchase/ subscribe to/ lease AI-powered devices/ services that facilitate AI-assisted teaching, and to subsidise students' participation in activities that enhance their AI literacy and skills. Generally, schools will receive the block funding of $500,000 on or before June 30, 2026. Schools can use the funding from the 2025/26 school year to the 2027/28 school year, until August 31, 2028.""
  
  The EDB encourages publicly funded schools to submit their applications for the said programme and have comprehensive planning of digital education (especially AI education) in schools, thereby empowering education through technology to enhance the quality of learning and teaching. For details of the programme and the related briefing sessions, please refer to EDB Circular No. 221/2025 (applications.edb.gov.hk/circular/upload/EDBCM/EDBCM25221E.pdf)."
Judiciary reaching out to law firms for registration and use of iCMS upon its extension to civil action cases in High Court ,2025-12-16 11:00,2025-12-16 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600193.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Judiciary:

  The Judiciary announced that starting this Friday (December 19), the integrated Court Case Management System (iCMS) will be extended to cover civil action cases (HCA) in the Court of First Instance of the High Court. The Judiciary is reaching out to law firms to assist with registration and use of iCMS.

  The iCMS provides a series of electronic services, including sending and receiving case-specific court documents to and from the courts, inspecting or searching filed documents and other case-related information held by the courts, searching cause books, and making payments for court services.

  The Judiciary encourages case parties, particularly law firms, to register and utilise e-filing for iCMS-enabled case types (Note). This offers a convenient, all-in-one and all-weather solution for the handling of court-related documents and payments anytime, anywhere. A 20 per cent concession is offered to iCMS users for three years on fee items of the High Court that are primarily or directly related to electronic handling of court documents.

  With the iCMS, there is no need to visit the High Court Building to scan (this function is available to litigants-in-person only) and upload the electronic copy of the document to be filed using the self-service kiosks at the Resource Centre for Unrepresented Litigants or to make payments in the Accounts Office for paper filing.

  The Judiciary is planning to make it mandatory for all legally represented parties to use e-filing under the iCMS (where available) from the latter half of 2026. To facilitate their migration from conventional paper mode to the iCMS in preparation for mandatory use, the Judiciary has been taking two proactive measures:


inviting all law firms to make an appointment with the Judiciary for technical assistance on using the iCMS, either at the High Court Building or their own offices, when they are initiating a new case of an iCMS-enabled case type for the first time; and
	
reaching out to all law firms which have not yet registered for iCMS accounts to help them register, open deposit accounts and provide on-site technical support where necessary to assist with e-filing procedures.


  Taking into account law firms' responses and available resources, the Judiciary may require all law firms initiating a new case through paper filing to go through an assisted e-filing process to enhance training on iCMS. The Judiciary may also consider imposing a deadline for registration as a prerequisite for mandatory use of iCMS in 2026.

  For more details about the iCMS, including its technical requirements, please visit the dedicated webpage on e-Courts of the Judiciary website atwww.judiciary.hk/en/e_courts/index.html.

  For enquiries, please call the general enquiry hotline at 2477 1002 or the technical helpline at 2886 6474, emailenquiry@judiciary.hk, or visit the Help Centre at 5/F, Wanchai Tower, 12 Harbour Road, Wan Chai.

Note: The iCMS currently covers personal injury actions, tax claim proceedings, civil action proceedings and employees' compensation cases in the District Court; summons cases in the Magistrates' Courts; bulk claims in the Small Claims Tribunal; and selected case types of civil proceedings in the High Court, including civil appeal cases in the Court of Appeal, commercial cases, construction and arbitration cases, intellectual property cases and personal injury cases, as well as civil action cases upon its rollout on December 19, in the Court of First Instance."

"Spanish award-winning multimedia theatre ""Laika"" to grace LCSD's ""Cheers!"" Series in January next year (with photos)",2025-12-16 11:00,2025-12-16 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121500216.htm,"  The ""Cheers!"" Series, presented by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, has invited Xirriquiteula Teatre from Spain to perform the multimedia theatre work ""Laika"" in Hong Kong in mid-January next year. The production employs multimedia elements such as video projection, puppets, automatons and shadow play, which invites audiences of all ages back to the 1950s to witness an interstellar journey about courage, friendship and the true meaning of life.

  Inspired by the true story of Laika, the first animal to orbit the Earth, the play follows the clever and gentle stray dog as she passes challenges of space training camp to become the first animal sent into outer space. Along the way, she develops a deep bond with the female scientist responsible for her care and training. Upon discovering that this is a one-way space mission, the scientist decides to embark on a thrilling escape adventure with Laika.

  The production incorporates elements beloved by children - space, rockets, science and adventure. An exquisitely crafted puppet dog, skillfully manipulated by the actors, brings Laika to life with remarkable vividness. Automatons are also used to portray the animals in the laboratory. In addition, creative shadow play, film montage and ingenious stage design are used to present a dazzling array of scenes - from hospital and laboratory to snowfield and rocket launch. Combined with the actors' heartfelt performance and compelling musical scores that heighten the story's tension and emotion, the play offers a rich and diverse theatrical experience. Through the touching human-canine bond, it also inspires audiences to reflect on the human drive towards scientific progress and the meaning of life.

  The production made its premiere in 2018 and has been adapted into 12 languages, performed more than 400 times across Europe and Asia, becoming one of the company's signature works. It has won the Best Show for Family Audiences at Spain's highest theatre honour MAX Award, alongside the Best Authorship and Direction at the European Children's Theatre Showcase FETEN Award and Best Show for Family Theatre at the Barcelona CRITIC'S Awards.

  Founded in Barcelona, Spain, in 1985, the Xirriquiteula Teatre has long been devoted to creating imaginative theatre and street performances for family audiences. Each production is distinguished by meticulous attention to detail and a spirit of innovation. Through collaborative creation with professionals from different disciplines and continuous artistic experimentation, the company commits to bringing audiences exceptional theatre productions.

  The ""Cheers!"" Series: ""Laika"" by Xirriquiteula Teatre (Spain) will be held at 7.30pm on January 16 and 17 (Friday and Saturday), and at 3pm on January 17 and 18 (Saturday and Sunday) next year at the Theatre of Hong Kong City Hall. The programme will be conducted in English with Chinese and English surtitles. Tickets priced at $220, $280 and $340 are now available at URBTIX (www.urbtix.hk).

（二）聯繫所有尚未註冊「綜合法院案件管理系統」帳戶的律師行，幫助他們註冊、開設預付款帳戶，並在有需要時提供現場技術支援，以協助他們進行電子存檔程序。
​
司法機構在考慮律師行的反應及可用資源後，或會要求所有以紙本方式提交新案件的律師行，必須先行在操作指導下進行電子存檔程序，以加強對「綜合案件管理系統」的培訓。此外，司法機構或會考慮設定註冊期限，作為二○二六年強制使用「綜合法院案件管理系統」的前提。

​有關「綜合法院案件管理系統」的更多詳情，包括技術要求，可瀏覽司法機構網站的電子法院專項網頁，網址為www.judiciary.hk/zh/e_courts/index.html。

《太空小狗萊卡》的靈感源自史上首隻太空犬萊卡的真實事件，講述聰明機智、性格溫順的流浪小狗萊卡通過太空訓練營的重重考驗，成為歷史上首隻被送往外太空的動物，並與負責照顧和訓練她的女科學家建立深厚的情誼。然而，當女科學家發現這是一次單程的太空任務後，決定與萊卡展開一場驚心動魄的逃脫冒險。

此劇融入兒童喜愛的太空、火箭、科學和探險元素，特製的木偶小狗配合演員的靈巧操控，將小狗萊卡演繹得栩栩如生，並利用機械裝置製作成實驗室內的動物。此外，別具創意的影子戲、影像剪接以及巧妙的舞台設計呈現醫院、實驗室、雪地、火箭升空等令人目不暇給的場景，加上演員情感真摰的演出，搭配音樂烘托出既緊張又感人的故事節奏，除為大小朋友帶來豐富多元的劇場體驗外，亦藉這段人狗情誼啓發觀眾思考人類科技進步與生命的意義。

《太空小狗萊卡》自二○一八年首演以來被翻譯成12種語言，在歐亞各地上演超過400場，成為劇團的王牌劇目之一。此作品曾榮獲西班牙戲劇最高榮譽MAX大獎最佳親子劇，另曾奪得FETEN歐洲兒童戲劇節最佳編劇及導演獎，以及巴塞隆拿戲劇評論大獎最佳親子劇等。

奇異手創劇團於一九八五年在西班牙巴塞隆拿成立，致力為家庭觀眾創作充滿奇思妙想的劇場和街頭表演作品，每部作品皆注重細節和創新。劇團透過與跨領域專業人士的集體創作和持續的藝術實驗，矢志為觀眾帶來優質劇作。

特區政府強烈譴責記協及反華外國媒體誤導公眾及為黎智英洗白,2025-12-16 10:00,2025-12-16 10:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600225.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十二月十六日）強烈譴責香港記者協會（記協）及反華外國媒體無視法庭嚴格依照法律和證據將黎智英等被告定罪的判決，企圖誤導公眾，刻意為罪犯黎智英洗白，及為他披上所謂民主的虛假外衣，目的是掩飾其操弄媒體以煽動大眾及出賣國家和人民利益，為外部勢力作滲透及對年輕人進行「洗腦」的顛覆工作和無恥行為。

特區政府發言人表示：「記協沒有公信力、沒有認受性、沒有代表性，甚至一直拒絕公開其新一屆執委成員名單。這樣的一個組織卻自詡為新聞界的代表機構，令人不齒。事實上，記協與其他反華外國媒體如出一轍，一直刻意誤導公眾，持續故意將『黎智英案』的犯罪行為與新聞自由混為一談，甚至借不同案件炒作詆譭香港特區的人權和法治狀況，目的正正就是要混淆視聽，污衊香港特區，令市民受其蒙蔽，實在是極度卑劣的政治操作，必須強烈譴責。」

「他們發表的誤導和失實言論，揭露他們根本沒有尊重特區法庭基於事實和證據就案件所作的獨立審判、拒絕正視裁決理由羅列的各項證據、拒絕理解法庭的考慮和裁決理由，就肆意發動攻擊，污衊和攻擊特區政府，完全是公然踐踏法治精神，以政治凌駕法治，歪曲事實、顛倒是非。」

法庭的定罪裁決絕無任何政治考慮

發言人表示：「法庭在裁決理由中已清楚表明，黎智英並非因其政治觀點或信念受審。法庭就本案頒下的裁決理由長達855頁，並完全公開供公眾查閱，當中已鉅細無遺地說明法庭對相關法律原則和證據的分析，以及裁定黎智英和三間被告公司有罪的理由。」

「黎智英案」與新聞自由完全無關

發言人再三重申：「『黎智英案』與新聞自由完全無關，各被告多年來是利用新聞報道為幌子，行禍國害港之實。黎智英根本就是一系列反中亂港事件的背後推手，是切切實實外部反華勢力的代理人。本案公開審訊中，揭示了黎智英密切管理和親自控制《蘋果日報》的編採方向，其中一名高層人員甚至稱之為『鳥籠』自主。」

「香港市民擁有《基本法》及《香港人權法案》所保障的新聞及言論自由。事實上，《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定，維護國家安全必須尊重及保障人權，並依法保障香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》及《經濟、社會與文化權利國際公約》適用於香港特區的權利與自由，包括新聞、言論及出版等自由。與世界其他地區一樣，新聞從業員與其他市民一樣，有義務遵守所有法律。根據《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條、《歐洲人權公約》以及相關判例確立的原則，傳媒及新聞從業員在發表言論、資訊及文章時，須承擔『特別責任和義務』，包括保障國家安全及公共秩序；新聞從業員必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由的保障。」

「特區政府強烈呼籲記協及其他一眾反華外國媒體，及早認清事實，回頭是岸，立即放棄為外部勢力進行任何形式的滲透及對特區年輕人進行『洗腦』的顛覆工作。特區政府絕對不會姑息任何煽動大眾以出賣國家和人民利益的危害國家安全行為。」"
"HKSAR Government strongly objects despicable political manipulations that smear and attack HKSAR using ""Lai Chee-ying's case""",2025-12-16 01:53,2025-12-16 02:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/16/P2025121600044.htm,"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government yesterday (December 15) expressed strong dissatisfaction with and opposition to the United States (US) and western countries, anti-China media, organisations and politicians for their malicious attacks, false statements, and smears against the HKSAR which totally disregarded the rule of law, following the court's conviction judgment in Lai Chee-ying's case, which was made strictly in accordance with the law and evidence.

A HKSAR Government spokesperson said, ""these biased statements and malicious smears from external forces precisely reflect that the national security risks we face are real. External forces showed no respect in the HKSAR court's independent judgment of the case, which had been made on the basis of facts and evidence. They also refused to acknowledge the evidence set out in the reasons for verdict, and refused to understand the court's considerations and rationale for the verdict. Instead, they wantonly launched attacks, slandered and attacked the HKSAR Government, which was clearly a case of politics trumping the law. With the external forces distorting facts and confounding right and wrong, their malicious intentions are clearly revealed. We must sternly denounce their wrongdoings to set the record straight.""

The court's conviction verdict was entirely free from any political considerations

The spokesperson reiterate: ""The court clearly pointed out in the reasons for verdict that Lai Chee-ying was not on trial for his political views or beliefs. The court's reasons for verdict in this case are 855 pages long, fully open for public inspection, and meticulously explain the court's analysis of the relevant legal principles and evidence, as well as the reasons for convicting Lai Chee-ying and the three defendant companies.

""The court clearly pointed out that Lai Chee-ying's only intent whether pre or post Hong Kong National Security Law (HKNSL) was to seek the downfall of the Communist Party of China even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of the PRC and the HKSAR.

""At the same time, the court found that the written articles under consideration were objectively seditious and written with a view to bringing the HKSAR Government into hatred and contempt and to exciting disaffection against it. The court also found that Lai Chee-ying was consciously using Apple Daily and his personal influence to carry out a consistent campaign with a view to undermining the legitimacy or authority of the Central People's Government (CPG), the HKSAR Government and their institutions and harming the relation between the CPG and the HKSAR Government with the people of Hong Kong. That went far beyond what would be permissible by the law.

""Relevant countries, anti-China media, organisations and politicians would only smear the HKSAR Government and HKSAR courts with empty slogans, alleging the so-called political persecution of Lai Chee-ying. Yet, they dare not face the fact that the court's conviction verdict is well-founded and reasoned, fully demonstrating that the court has made its decision on the case strictly in accordance with the law and evidence, free from any interference, and absolutely free of any political considerations.""

The spokesperson stressed, ""Hong Kong is a society underpinned by the rule of law and has always adhered to the principle that laws must be obeyed and lawbreakers be held accountable. Article 5 of the HKNSL and section 2 of the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance (SNSO) clearly stipulate that the principle of the rule of law shall be adhered to in preventing, suppressing and imposing punishment for offences endangering national security. Any suggestion that certain individuals or organisations should be immune from legal consequences for their illegal acts is no different from advocating a special privilege to break the law, and this totally runs contrary to the spirit of the rule of law.""

Lai Chee-ying's case has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all

The spokesperson said, ""Some media organisations and organizations that claim to represent journalists, have conflated the criminal acts in this case with freedom of the press, and have even played up different cases to vilify the HKSAR, with the purpose of misleading the public and defaming the HKSAR's human rights and rule of law. In fact, Lai Chee-ying's case has nothing to do with freedom of the press at all. Over the years, the defendants were using journalism as a guise to commit acts that brought harm to our country and Hong Kong. The public trial of this case revealed Lai Chee-ying's close management and hands-on control of the editorial direction of Apple Daily, and one of the senior officials even said they were free within a 'bird cage'. Meanwhile, Lai Chee-ying had repeatedly and personally colluded with foreign forces, begging for sanctions and hostile actions against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR Government.

""Hong Kong citizens enjoy freedom of the press and freedom of speech as protected under the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. In fact, the HKNSL and the SNSO clearly stipulate that human rights shall be respected and protected in safeguarding national security. The rights and freedoms, including the freedoms of the press, of speech and of publication, enjoyed by Hong Kong people under the Basic Law and the provisions of the International Covenant on Civic and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to the HKSAR, are protected in accordance with the law. Like all other places in the world, journalists, just like all other citizens, have an obligation to abide by all the laws. According to the principles established by Article 19 of the ICCPR, the European Convention on Human Rights and relevant jurisprudence, when the media and journalists publish opinions, information and articles, they must observe and discharge 'special duties and responsibilities', including protection of national security and public order; journalists must, in accordance with the tenets of 'responsible journalism', act in good faith on accurate factual basis and provide reliable and precise information, so as to be entitled to the protection of freedom of speech and press freedom.""

Lai Chee-ying undermined the fundamental interests of the country and the well-being of Hong Kong citizens

The spokesperson reiterate: ""Lai Chee-ying has long been using his media outlet, Apple Daily, to wantonly create social conflicts, incite social antagonism, incite hatred, glorify violence and openly beg for foreign sanctions against China and the HKSAR, attracting external interference. He has harmed the fundamental interests of the country and the well-being of the people of Hong Kong; his actions are shameful and his intentions malicious. His wanton crimes were committed in full view of the public and the evidence is compelling. The court's conviction demonstrates that righteousness is upheld by the law and the core values of Hong Kong are safeguarded. The law never allows anyone, regardless of profession or background, to harm their country and compatriots under the guise of human rights, democracy, and freedom.

""The HKSAR has a responsibility to safeguard national security and will resolutely combat acts and activities endangering national security. Hong Kong is underpinned by the rule of law and the HKSAR Government is committed to ensuring that laws are observed and strictly enforced so as to bring offenders to account. We will do our utmost to prevent, suppress and impose punishment for acts and activities endangering national security to fulfil this perfectly justified responsibility."""
Government announces updates on follow-up work on Tai Po fire,2025-12-15 23:16,2025-12-15 23:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500938.htm," The three task forces set up by the Government for the fire at Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po - the Task Force on Investigation and Regulation, the Task Force on Emergency Support and Fund-Raising, and the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements - are making full efforts to follow up on the support, relief, and investigation work related to the incident. Details are as follows:

Financial and welfare support
---------------------------------

 For the Support Fund for Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po, established by the Government, donations received are about $3.4 billion as of noon today (December 15). With the start-up capital of $300 million from the Government, the fund's total has now reached around $3.7 billion. The fund will be used to assist residents in rebuilding their homes and providing long-term and sustained support.

 The Government earlier announced that a living allowance from the Support Fund will be provided to each affected household, and the amount has been increased from $50,000 to $100,000. As of today, 1 883 cases have been processed. In addition, the Government will provide families of each deceased victim with a token of solidarity of $200,000, as well as $50,000 to cover funeral costs. As of today, a total of 130 cases have been processed. The allowance will be disbursed in phases.

 Social workers from the Social Welfare Department (SWD) have been in contact with more than 1 980 affected households, providing the ""one social worker per household"" follow-up service to more than 4 900 residents. The SWD will maintain liaison with the affected households to provide all necessary assistance while fully supporting the relief work of the Government.

 In addition, the Government also provides support and assistance to foreign domestic helpers (FDHs) affected by the fire. The Labour Department has been maintaining close liaison with the Consulates-General of the Philippines and Indonesia in Hong Kong to co-ordinate and follow up on the relevant work. Besides providing tokens of solidarity of $200,000 and funeral grants of $50,000 to families of each deceased FDH, as well as injury grants of $50,000 or $100,000 to injured FDHs, the Government has disbursed a special subsidy of $20,000 to 110 FDHs employed at Wang Fuk Court.

 Meanwhile, the Immigration Department (ImmD) has made special arrangements for FDHs whose employers are unable to continue their employment contracts due to the fire. Under these arrangements, affected FDHs are allowed to remain in Hong Kong for three months as visitors to seek new employers (extendable if necessary), without having to return to their places of origin first. The ImmD will also waive the relevant fees for their extension of stay.

Accommodation support
---------------------------

 As of this morning, a total of 1 336 residents have been accommodated, through the co-ordination of the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, in youth hostels, camps, or hotel rooms. Another 3 247 residents are currently living in transitional housing units provided by the Housing Bureau, units from the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS), or Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun.

  Currently, there is still an abundant supply of more than 1000 units that can provide affected residents with longer term accommodation. The transitional housing and HKHS projects in different districts can altogether provide around 400 units at the moment. Besides, Po Tin Interim Housing in Tuen Mun and Runway 1331 at Kai Tak can provide a supply of around 900 units.

  In consideration of the extremely urgent situation of the residents affected by the fire incident, a special arrangement of a full rent exemption has been made earlier by the Housing Bureau to provide accommodation support to those affected residents moving into transitional housing or HKHS projects. In other words, if needed, the affected residents can stay for a longer period of time. The Government will continue to support the affected residents in terms of accommodation, and the residents in need do not have to worry about the relevant rental expenses or the duration of stay.

  In addition, staff from the operating organisations of transitional housing and HKHS, as well as volunteers have been working around the clock to furnish the units with essential supplies, striving to meet the needs of the residents. All the currently available units in transitional housing and HKHS projects are equipped with furniture and appliances such as bed frames, mattresses, induction cookers and water heaters, etc, enabling the residents to settle in comfortably. At the same time, a number of organisations have proactively stationed their staff in some projects to provide residents in need with various forms of support. Taking T-Loft@Kai Tak in Kai Tak and T-Loft@Lok Wo in Ma On Shan as examples, the operators have not only arranged social workers to provide emotional support and assist with daily needs for the affected residents, but also set up dedicated emotional support stations within these projects. Volunteers were organised to serve on shifts, providing ongoing companionship and care to the affected residents, standing with them through the difficult time.

Relief supplies and donations
---------------------------------

  Thesupplies donation online platform, established by the Government and the information technology sector, continues to operate, facilitating the registration of supplies donations from organisations and the public. The Government has so far received over 1 800 registrations, of which approximately 30 per cent were submitted by organisations, whereas the others were contributed by the public. The various registered donation items include food and beverages, clothing, daily necessities, bedding, and electrical appliances. The Government is actively assessing residents' actual needs through the relevant policy bureau, government departments, and service organisations for the matching of donated supplies in order to distribute appropriate items in phases to places in need. So far, about 23 000 donation items covering various categories have been distributed to different places. The matching and distribution of supplies will continue.

Regulation and inspection work
----------------------------------

  The Development Bureau (DEVB) announced on December 11 a new mechanism for sampling and testing scaffold nets for external walls in Hong Kong. The DEVB is moving ahead in full steam the supporting arrangements to ensure that there are sufficient designated laboratories and a suitable site for off-site sampling work."
特區政府強烈反對藉「黎智英案」抹黑攻擊香港特區的卑劣政治操弄,2025-12-15 22:50,2025-12-15 23:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500926.htm,"​香港特別行政區（特區）政府今日（十二月十五日）就多個美西方國家、反華媒體、組織及政客，在特區法庭嚴格依照法律和證據就「黎智英案」頒下定罪判決後，完全無視法治精神，惡意攻擊香港特區，作出種種失實言論和污衊抹黑，特區政府表示強烈不滿和反對。

特區政府發言人表示：「這些來自外部勢力的失實言論和污衊抹黑，正正反映國家安全風險是真實存在的。他們根本沒有尊重特區法庭基於事實和證據就案件所作的獨立審判、拒絕正視裁決理由羅列的各項證據、拒絕理解法庭的考慮和裁決理由，就肆意發動攻擊，污衊和攻擊特區政府，完全是以政治凌駕法治，歪曲事實、顛倒是非，其險惡用心昭然若揭，必須嚴厲直斥其非，以正視聽。」

法庭的定罪裁決絕無任何政治考慮

發言人重申：「法庭在裁決理由中已清楚表明，黎智英並非因其政治觀點或信念受審。法庭就本案頒下的裁決理由長達855頁，並完全公開供公眾查閱，當中已鉅細無遺地説明法庭對相關法律原則和證據的分析，以及裁定黎智英和三間被告公司有罪的理由。」

「法庭明確指出，不論在《香港國安法》實施前或後，黎智英的唯一意圖就是，即使要犧牲中國和香港特區人民的利益，也要謀求中國共產黨倒台。」

「同時，法庭裁定案中考慮的書面文章客觀上具有煽動性，撰寫時旨在引發對香港特區政府的憎恨和藐視及挑動對其的離叛。法庭也裁定黎智英有意識地利用《蘋果日報》和其個人的影響力去進行持續不斷的活動，以達致下述目的：削弱中央政府、香港特區政府及其機構的合法性或權威；損害中央政府和香港特區政府與香港居民的關係。這已遠超出法律所允許的範圍。」

「有關國家、反華媒體、組織及政客，只懂以空洞無物的口號抹黑特區政府及特區法庭對黎智英進行所謂『政治逼害』，卻不敢面對法庭的定罪裁決有理有節，完全展現法庭是嚴格依照法律和證據作出裁決，不受任何干涉，絕無任何政治考慮的事實。」

發言人強調：「香港特區是法治社會，一直秉持有法必依、違法必究的原則。《香港國安法》第五條和《維護國家安全條例》第2條明確訂明防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全犯罪，應當堅持法治原則。倡議某種背景的人或組織不應就其違法行為和活動受到法律制裁，等同給予其犯法特權，完全違反法治精神。」

「黎智英案」與新聞自由完全無關

發言人表示：「部分傳媒機構及自詡代表新聞工作者的組織，繼續將本案的犯罪行為與新聞自由混為一談，甚至借不同案件炒作詆譭香港特區的人權和法治狀況，目的是混淆視聽，污衊香港特區。事實是，『黎智英案』與新聞自由完全無關，各被告多年來是利用新聞報道為幌子，行禍國害港之實。本案公開審訊中，揭示了黎智英密切管理和親自控制《蘋果日報》的編採方向，其中一名高層人員甚至稱之為『鳥籠』自主，而黎智英更多次親自勾結外國勢力，乞求對中央和香港特區政府實施制裁和進行敵對行動。」

「香港市民擁有《基本法》及《香港人權法案》所保障的新聞及言論自由。事實上，《香港國安法》及《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定，維護國家安全必須尊重及保障人權，並依法保障香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》及《經濟、社會與文化權利國際公約》適用於香港特區的權利與自由，包括新聞、言論及出版等自由。與世界其他地區一樣，新聞從業員與其他市民一樣，有義務遵守所有法律。根據《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》第十九條、《歐洲人權公約》以及相關判例確立的原則，傳媒及新聞從業員在發表言論、資訊及文章時，須承擔『特別責任和義務』，包括保障國家安全及公共秩序；新聞從業員必須按『負責任新聞作業』原則真誠地行事，以準確事實為基礎，並提供準確可靠的資訊，方可獲言論和新聞自由的保障。」

黎智英損害國家根本利益和香港市民福祉

發言人重申：「黎智英長期利用旗下媒體《蘋果日報》肆意製造社會矛盾、挑撥社會對立，煽動仇恨、美化暴力，公然乞求外國制裁中國、制裁香港特區、招引外部干預。黎智英損害國家根本利益和香港市民福祉，其行可恥，其心歹毒。黎智英恣意妄為的罪行是在眾目睽睽下進行，證據確鑿，法庭的定罪判決彰顯了法律的正義，維護了香港的核心價值。法律從不容許任何職業或背景的人假借人權、民主和自由之名，公然傷害自己的國家及同胞。」

「香港特區有責任維護國家安全，會堅決打擊危害國家安全的行為和活動。香港是法治社會，特區政府有法必依、違者必究、執法必嚴，我們會全力防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全的行為和活動，履行這天經地義的責任。」"
​政府公布跟進大埔火災最新情況,2025-12-15 22:50,2025-12-15 23:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500931.htm,"政府就大埔宏福苑火災成立的三個工作組——調查及規管工作組、緊急支援及募捐工作組，以及應急住宿安排工作組——正全力持續跟進火災的支援、善後及調查事宜，詳情如下：

經濟及福利援助
———————

截至今日（十二月十五日）中午，政府成立的「大埔宏福苑援助基金」已收到的外界捐款約34億元，連同政府投入的三億元啓動資金，基金總額約為37億元，會用在協助居民重建家園，是長期和持續的支援。

政府早前宣布從基金向每戶受影響家庭發放生活津貼，金額已由五萬元增至十萬元，截至今日已處理1 883宗個案；另外，就每名死者向家屬發放20萬元慰問金及五萬元殮葬金，截至今日已處理130宗個案。政府會陸續發放有關款項。

社會福利署（社署）社工已接觸超過1 980個受影響住戶，為超過4 900名居民提供「一戶一社工」服務。社署會與受影響住戶保持聯繫，為他們提供一切所需協助，並全力支援政府的善後工作。

此外，政府亦向在火災中受影響的外籍家庭傭工（外傭）提供支援及協助。勞工處一直與菲律賓和印尼駐港總領事館保持緊密聯繫，協調及跟進有關工作。除就每名不幸離世的外傭向家屬發放20萬元慰問金及五萬元殮葬金，以及向受傷的外傭發放五萬元或十萬元的受傷補助外，政府已向110名於宏福苑受僱的外傭提供二萬元特別補助。

另一方面，入境事務處（入境處）為因火災導致僱主未能繼續履行僱傭合約的外傭作出特別安排，容許他們以訪客身分留港三個月尋找新僱主（可按需要再延長），毋須先返回原居地。入境處亦會豁免相關的延長逗留期限費用。

住宿援助
————

截至今日上午，共有1 336名居民入住由民政及青年事務局協調的青年宿舍／營舍或酒店房間；另有3 247名居民現居於房屋局的過渡性房屋、香港房屋協會（房協）項目或屯門寶田中轉房屋的單位。

目前能夠用於較長期安置受影響居民的單位尚有一千多個，供應足夠。位於不同區域的過渡性房屋和房協項目目前仍可提供約400個單位。此外，位於屯門的寶田中轉房屋及位於啟德的「啟航1331」，共有約900個單位供應。

考慮到受火災影響居民非常緊急的情況，房屋局早前已作出特別安排，對入住過渡性房屋或房協項目的受影響居民提供住宿援助，租金全免。換句話說，如有需要，受影響的居民可以較長期入住。政府會在住宿方面一直支援受影響居民，有需要的居民無需擔心相關租金開支或居住期。

此外，過渡性房屋營運機構及房協的職員和義工日以繼夜為單位添置生活所需物資，盡力滿足居民的需求。目前所有過渡性房屋及房協項目可供入住的單位均已配備床架、床褥、電磁爐和熱水爐等家具電器，讓居民可以放心入住。同時，不少團體主動派員到部分項目，為有需要的居民提供不同方面的支援。以啟德‧東寓和馬鞍山樂和‧東寓為例，營運機構除安排機構社工為受影響居民提供情緒支援及跟進生活所需外，更特別在項目內設立情緒支援站，並組織義工輪值服務，持續陪伴和關懷受影響居民，與他們共渡難關。

物資援助／捐獻
———————

政府與資訊科技業界構建的物資捐獻網上平台繼續運作，團體及市民可於平台登記可捐贈的物資。政府至今共收到超過1 800個登記，其中約三成由機構提出，而餘下的由市民個人提出。已登記可捐獻物品種類涵蓋食品及飲品、衣物、日常生活用品、寢具、電器等多個類別。政府正透過相關政策局、政府部門和服務團體掌握居民的實際需要後進行物資配對工作，以便陸續把適用物資派送往有需要的地點。至今已有約23 000件涵蓋不同類別的物資配送至多個地點。物資配對和分發工作會持續進行。

規管巡查

Remarks by S for S at media session on Lai Chee-ying case,2025-12-15 20:31,2025-12-15 20:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500704.htm,"Following are theremarksmadebytheSecretary for Security, Mr Tang Ping-keung, at a mediasession on the Lai Chee-ying case thisafternoon (December 15):

Reporter: Firstly, regarding the verdict of this case, does this mean the cases surrounding Apple Daily have officially concluded and there will be no more prosecution in this regard? Secondly, regarding this case attracting heavy international media and political attention, are you worried that this verdict will draw further international sanctions towards Hong Kong, particularly from US President Donald Trump? Thank you.

Secretary for Security: First of all, I do not comment on individual suspects or organisations. For whatever criminal cases, including those relating to national security, if we have evidence, we will arrest (those suspects). If we have sufficient evidence, we will prosecute (suspects). No one is above the law. Regarding the international concerns of this case, I think a lot of foreign consulate staff attending the trial throughout are the witnesses of how open and fair this trial is.

I think this illustrates these kinds of activities, happening in any country, if someone uses the media to try to overturn a regime, I think this is not bearable by every government. I think this case illustrates how safe Hong Kong is and how we are able to interdict all the national security concerns and all the attempts to affect the national security. I think this is a good showcase to show that Hong Kong is safe and it is safe to do investments in Hong Kong.

Reporter: How do you make sure today's verdict does not affect freedom of the press in Hong Kong?

Secretary for Security: First of all, the verdict states very clearly that this is nothing to do with the freedom of press in this case. It is solely because of Lai Chee-ying's utilising of Apple Daily as a platform to advocate his hatred against the Government and his plot to try to overturn our CPG's (Central People's Government) regime.

記者：想請教兩個問題。首先，今早有提及裁決內容還有牽涉部分其他人，之後會不會再採取不同的拘捕行動？另外裁判結果出來後，一些外國領事也有發言，會否就着關注本案的發言有回應？謝謝。

保安局局長：我在這裏不評論個別的嫌疑人是誰，或者是我們會採取甚麼行動。但我想說，任何人只要你犯了法例，包括維護國家安全相關的條例，我們都會調查到底，有證據就會拘捕你，足夠證據就會起訴，沒有人會在法律之上。

至於一些外國領事，我想跟大家說，在整個審訊過程中，都有不同的外國領事和職員在旁聽，他們都是我們這個公平、公正、公開審訊的證人，證明我們這個審訊是將所有的事實，都是用我們的證據顯露出來的，我相信這些外國領事，很清楚整件事到底是怎樣。

記者：想了解一下黎智英目前的健康狀況和懲教署現時怎樣檢查和照顧被關押人士的身體狀況？

保安局局長：我知道很多人在審訊期間，包括一些美西方（國家）或黎智英的家人企圖抹黑特區政府、抹黑懲教署，指黎智英得不到一些適切的服務，包括醫療服務或一些宗教服務。我在此可以再說一次，這些指控全都是謊言，都是捏造和誤導的。因為事實上就是懲教署為黎智英與其他囚犯一樣，提供一個適切的治療，包括我們在八月份開始，每日有人和他檢查身體；他當時說心臟不舒服，我們有一個儀器讓他戴着。另外在出席法庭（審訊）時，我們都是有醫護人員和他在一起。至於宗教服務，他是有一位特定的教士和他進行宗教服務，包括領聖餐。至於有些人誣捏指我們單獨囚禁他，事實上單獨囚禁是根據他的意願，懲教署署長根據相關的規定，基於他的安全或其他考慮而提供一個適當的安排。多謝大家。

​保安局局長就「黎智英案」會見傳媒開場發言（只有中文）,2025-12-15 20:30,2025-12-15 20:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202512/15/P2025121500771.htm,"以下是保安局局長鄧炳強今日（十二月十五日）下午就「黎智英案」會見傳媒的開場發言：

各位香港市民、各位記者朋友，大家好。高等法院原訟法庭剛剛在今日就黎智英和《蘋果日報》三間相關公司，被控共三項與國家安全有關的罪行，包括兩項「串謀勾結外國或者境外勢力危害國家安全罪」和一項「串謀刊印、發布、出售、要約出售、分發、展示及／或複製煽動刊物罪」的案件作出裁決，將黎智英和《蘋果日報》相關的三間公司定罪。特區政府表示歡迎法庭的定罪裁決。

法庭的定罪裁決清楚說明，任何企圖危害國家安全的人都必然難逃法網。無論他們怎樣狡辯，事實和證據在法庭面前都會不攻自破，法庭的審判必定會揭露所有真相。

事實上，早前在法庭的公開審訊中，庭上的證據已經清楚顯示案情的嚴重性。從控方列出海量的文字、影像證據和一些證人的供詞，都是將黎智英參與策劃、組織、發動一系列的暴亂惡行的主導角色明顯地向社會展示了出來。

黎智英和他的團夥多年來利用《蘋果日報》作為平台，散播假消息、假新聞，為反對派提供抹黑中央、「唱衰」特區政府的平台，以虛假、片面的報道誤導市民、荼毒青年，更加煽動仇恨、宣揚和美化暴力，還為反中亂港分子提供資金，以及支持所謂的「港獨」勢力，引發了二○一九年的港版「顏色革命」和「黑暴」，令全港市民受到無盡的苦難和傷痛。

更無恥的是，他充當了美西方的代理人，乞求外部勢力，制裁特區和國家，出賣國家利益，配合美西方肆無忌憚插手香港的事務，在香港製造亂局，令經濟停頓，嚴重損害社會發展。

法庭在裁決理由中清楚表明，黎智英並非因為其政治觀點或信念而受審。黎智英長年對中國懷有怨憤和憎恨，遠在《香港國安法》實施前，黎智英已經構思美國可以利用什麼手段去制衡中國。當二○一九年的示威演變成抗爭運動，黎智英和《蘋果日報》走在抗爭運動的最前線。案中大量的文件證據是支持控方證人的證供，認為他們誠實可靠，包括黎智英的即時通訊軟件紀錄，證明Mark Simon積極為他安排與一些美國高層官員、國會議員和政客等會面，表達希望美國對中國和香港特區實施制裁、封鎖和敵對行為。黎智英指示《蘋果日報》的高層發起一人一信的行動，藉此爭取美國對中國實施制裁。法庭指出《香港國安法》實施後，雖然黎智英請求制裁的言行變得含蓄，但是無論在《香港國安法》實施之前或者之後，他唯一的意圖就是即使要犧牲中國和香港特區人民的利益，也要謀求中國共產黨倒台。法庭更認為黎智英作供時多處自相矛盾，前後不一，閃爍其詞，以及不足為信，法庭拒絕接納他的供詞。

黎智英是三項控罪所指的串謀的首腦，他的所作所為顯示他意圖實施該等串謀，會對中國和對特區的國家安全構成威脅和傷害。法庭還裁定了案中所考慮的一些書面文章，客觀上都是具有煽動性。他為了引發對香港特區政府的憎恨和蔑視，並且要挑動叛離，法庭亦裁定黎智英是利用《蘋果日報》和其個人影響力去進行持續不斷的活動，以削弱中央政府、香港特區政府和機構的合法性和權威，以及損害中央政府、特區政府與香港居民的關係。

其實本案自開審至今，外部勢力和反中亂港分子一直都在顛倒是非，以卑劣的政治操弄和謊言，企圖美化黎智英和他的團隊的犯罪行為，不斷抹黑香港特區一直無畏無懼、依法採取的執法行動和司法程序，更以所謂的「制裁」的無恥手段，企圖恫嚇法官、檢控官、執法人員和其他特區政府官員，去製造壓力，甚至干預案件的公平審訊，這都是公然踐踏法治的卑劣圖謀，我必須予以最強烈譴責。

對於這些外部勢力的惡意抹黑和攻擊，特區政府必須嚴正反駁，將事實展現給香港市民和全世界知道，所以我要強調以下五點：

第一，法庭的審訊是公平、公正、公開。黎智英案的審訊期長達156日，法庭是審視了多達2 220項的證物、超過8萬頁文件，有14位控方證人出庭作供，以及其他辯方證據，加上各方呈交總共超過1 000頁的書面陳詞。黎智英本人更用了52日作供。我相信這些鐵一般的事實就是黎智英和其他被告經過公平的審訊後才被裁定有罪，這就是清楚的證明。而今日法庭頒下裁決理由長達855頁，而且是完全公開，讓公眾可以查閱，鉅細無遺地說明法庭對相關的法律原則和證據的分析，裁定黎智英和他的團夥有罪，是有理有節，充分彰顯法庭嚴格依照法律和證據作出的裁決，不受任何干預，更加絕無任何所謂的政治考量。

第二，本案的公開審訊中亦揭示，黎智英多次親自勾結外國勢力，主動發動對中央及香港特區政府的制裁和敵對行為，明顯是以做新聞為名，其實是作出危害國家安全的犯罪行為。我要再次強調，「黎智英案」與新聞自由是絕無關係。他只是多年來利用新聞報道作為幌子，來行禍港之實，其行可恥，其惡當懲。

我剛剛留意到沒有公信力的記協（香港記者協會），這個連自己執委的名單都不敢告訴別人——我不知道是不是因為執委中像之前一樣，主力都是外媒人士，主力都是一些所謂的自由媒體，甚至可能根本都不是記者——的組織。記協說，有人因為從事新聞而身陷囹圄。我想再強調一次，「黎智英案」的判決與新聞自由完全無關，是他利用新聞作為幌子，作出危害國家安全的行為。

香港市民擁有《基本法》和《香港人權法案》保障的新聞和言論自由。事實上，《香港國安法》和《維護國家安全條例》均明確規定維護國家安全應當尊重和保障人權，亦依法保護香港居民根據《基本法》、《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》，以及《經濟、社會與文化權利的國際公約》適用於香港特區在有關規定下享有的權利和自由，包括新聞、言論和出版等自由。

與世界其他地方一樣，新聞從業員和其他人一樣，都有義務遵守所有法律，包括刑事法律。《公民權利和政治權利國際公約》亦清楚列明，傳媒和工作人員在發布言論、資訊和文章時，必須遵守和執行「特別責任和義務」。「特別責任和義務」包括保障國家安全和公共秩序，而且，根據《歐洲人權公約》，只有建基於事實的報道，才能得到言論和新聞自由的保障。

第三，「黎智英案」、加上近年法庭就多宗涉及危害國家安全的案件所作出的裁決，都證明《香港國安法》和其他維護國家安全的條例的相關法律，是真的能夠切切實實地制止和懲治危害國家安全的犯罪行為。這一道堅實的法律屏障，有助於將犯罪分子繩之於法，避免香港和國家受到最大的傷害，亦有不堪設想的後果。

第四，黎智英和他的團夥的犯罪行為證據確鑿、罪有應得，雖然法庭已經作出正義的定罪裁決，將他們入罪，但在審訊期間，種種事件都揭露當前地緣政治形勢仍然複雜多變，香港特區仍然面對以下的國家安全風險，包括：

（一）外部敵對勢力一直以「黎智英案」作為藉口，抹黑攻擊特區政府依法維護國家安全的工作，甚至對中央和特區政府的官員實施所謂「制裁」。其中一例，就是今年四月，美國再次將六位盡忠職守、致力維護國家安全的中央及香港特區官員加入所謂「制裁」名單；而近至上星期，美國又藉「國會及行政當局中國委員會」發表的所謂「二零二五年報告」，對特區維護國家安全相關法律發表無稽失實的內容，更對黎智英的羈管安排作出毫無根據的批評，意圖妨礙司法公正。我必須強調，我們對這些所謂「制裁」及抹黑，無畏無懼；

（二）至於潛逃海外的反中亂港分子，包括指明潛逃者及通緝犯，甘願淪為配合外部勢力「以港遏華」陰謀勾當的棋子，不但在外部勢力的包庇下繼續從事危害國家安全的行為及活動，甚至不顧廉恥，乞求外部勢力「制裁」國家及香港特區。例如「叫人衝、自己鬆」的許智峯，他公然乞憐美西方國家包庇黎智英，以及尋求協助將他釋放。另外，通緝犯袁弓夷都有公然聲援罪犯黎智英。

（三）外部勢力和他們的代理人繼續透過「軟對抗」，利用假新聞、假消息，企圖令市民不信任政府或對政府產生不滿。例如在「黎智英案」審訊期間，有人誣捏特區政府不向他提供醫療服務，拒絕他得到宗教服務，又指政府強制將他單獨囚禁，這些全部都是謊言。

同時，不少國際組織和他們的喉舌，亦試圖製造自己站在維護人權等道德高地的假象，透過發表一些所謂報告，肆意對香港特區作出不實陳述，處心積慮希望加深各界對香港情況的誤解及偏見。

第五，剛才我提到外部勢力一直抹黑懲教署，包括指黎智英未得到適切的對待，這些全部都是想危害國家安全的人特意捏造，向法庭施壓的卑劣政治操作，我必須用事實一一反駁。

懲教署一直致力為所有在囚人士，不論他們的身分、地位，都為他們提供安全、人道、合適和健康的羈管環境; 亦按法例要求提供有益健康、與現行國際健康指引相符的膳食。懲教署在處理黎智英有關事宜，都是採取以上安排，與其他在囚人士無異。

醫療方面，黎智英羈押期間所獲得的醫療服務完備。懲教署為在囚人士提供的醫療服務由衞生署及醫院管理局提供，一般情況下會由進駐懲教院所的醫護人員提供檢查及治療，而按個別在囚人士的需要，亦會將個案轉介到醫院管理局轄下的專科部門跟進。專業的醫護人員會為病人提供最適切的醫療服務，對所有在囚人士亦一視同仁。

在今年八月的審訊時，黎智英表示感到心臟不適，懲教署隨即安排專科醫護人員跟進，更安排黎智英佩戴監測心臟情況的儀器，在黎智英出庭時更加有醫護人員陪同。自此，懲教院所每日都幫黎智英安排身體檢查。代表黎智英的資深大律師亦有向法庭清楚表明，懲教院所為黎智英每日安排醫療檢查，黎智英對懲教院所內獲得的醫療服務並無任何投訴，法官更加表示懲教署所作的安排值得稱讚。

宗教服務方面，懲教署亦有安排專職教士按黎智英的意願提供宗教服務，包括領聖餐。

至於外部勢力經常炒作所謂「單獨囚禁」，事實是根據黎智英本人的意願，並由懲教署署長考慮相關因素後，根據《監獄規例》為保障囚犯人身安全及福祉而作出的安排。

懲教署亦設有一系列機制，例如透過太平紳士定期巡視的安排，確保在囚人士的權利獲得保障。如在囚人士有任何意見或不滿，可透過署內或者署外不同途徑，例如向申訴專員作出申訴。

面對以上的國家安全風險和攻擊，特區政府必定會繼續嚴謹執行現行的《香港國安法》、《維護國家安全條例》及其他相關法律，致力維護國家安全；而市民大眾亦必定要慎思明辨，絕對不要讓外部勢力及反中亂港分子誤導。

在此，我要衷心感謝司法機構、律政司、警務處、懲教署及所有相關人士。他們在處理本案海量工作的同時，亦要面對外部勢力的抹黑、恐嚇甚至制裁，但是他們依然無畏無懼、秉持專業，堅定依法履行職責，彰顯出對法治及公義的堅持。

最後，我亦要感謝香港市民，他們在經歷二○一九年的港版「顏色革命」及「黑暴」之後，見到危害國家安全的行為時不再啞忍，對於暴力行為亦敢於挺身而出，同時積極提供資料或者舉報。直到目前為止，國家安全舉報熱線收到超過100萬個相關舉報或情報信息，對執法機構的調查工作有極大幫助。

剛才我留意到國安處（香港警務處國家安全處）的總警司李桂華在法庭門外講了一段說話，他說在審訊其間黎智英親口承認鼓動更多年輕人上街，藉着遊行的畫面突出很多人不滿政府，原來年輕人在黎智英眼中只是畫面，而不是人；是畫面，是被利用來反政府的工具。我聽到這番說話有很深的感受，在二○一九年「黑暴」期間，我在街頭被很多年輕人扔磚、扔汽油彈。很多這些年輕人其實本質不壞，我自己有些朋友的子女就是因為被人鼓動、挑動、煽動了，出去扔磚頭、扔汽油彈，他們平時很乖的，粗言都不說一句。我見到當時這些年輕人好像瘋狂了一樣，對一些意見不同的人就會打到（對方）血流披面。我還記得在深水埗有的士司機就是因為跟他們意見不同，就（被）打到全身都是血。這些瘋狂表現令到我極度震驚。後來我有機會在懲教署見到這些年輕人因為犯法要承受法律後果而入獄，當中包括唐英傑。他們都向我表示當初就是受到這些煽動而（被）誤導作出這些違法行為。其實事後我們在一些搜查行動中，發覺有些被捕人的家裏有很多《蘋果日報》的剪報，包括當時每天隨《蘋果日報》附送的那些煽動性的海報。

其實直到現在，還有些人在製造炸彈，有些人在秘密從事軍事訓練，他們認為當「黑暴」再來時就可以對抗。黎智英和他控制的《蘋果日報》就是這樣煽動我們的年輕人，為了自己反政府的目的，犧牲了一代的年輕人，我希望被他煽動的年輕人和他們的家人因為今天（黎智英被）定罪的判決得到釋懷。

黎智英當日將年輕人當作工具，今日他的剩餘價值只是讓美西方作為一個用來抹黑香港政府和中國的工具。因為地緣政治，這些美西方的政客、媒體和記者不停抹黑香港和國家。我知道他們的角色就是要造謠生事，抹黑我們。但是我希望這些政客、媒體和記者可以把他們的手放在自己的良心上，如果這些被鼓動而要承受法律後果的是你的子女，你會怎樣想？

最後，香港特區政府會一如既往、堅定不移、嚴格按照法治的原則，堅持有法必依，執法必嚴，違法必究，依法有效地防範、制止、懲治危害國家安全的活動和行為。

多謝大家。"
