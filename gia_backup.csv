DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-10-19 06:46,2025-10-19 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/19/P2025101900012.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (October 19) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

Police hold Anti-Crime Elite Games (with photos),2025-10-18 20:08,2025-10-18 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800667.htm,"The Anti-Crime Elite Games, organised by the Crime Wing of the Hong Kong Police Force, is being held today and tomorrow (October 18 and 19) at the West Kowloon Cultural District. Through various activities incorporating sports elements, the event aims to disseminate messages about anti-drugs, child protection, cyber security, anti-deception and anti-money laundering.

Speaking at the kick-off ceremony, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, stated that given the complex and ever-changing crime landscape, collaborative efforts from all stakeholders, not just the Police, are required to effectively prevent and combat crime, as well as safeguard the growth of young people.

In the first eight months of this year, the number of youths arrested for criminal offenses has continued to improve, showing a 10 per cent decrease compared to the same period last year, totalling 1 742 individuals. Notably, arrests related to money laundering and deception have seen declines of 50 per cent and 32.4 per cent respectively. However, arrests related to serious drug offences and indecent assaults have increased by 45.2 per cent and 33.3 per cent.

Mr Chow stated that etomidate has become the most commonly abused drug among different age groups, followed by cannabis and cocaine. He emphasised that drug abuse remains drug abuse, regardless of the circumstances. It is not a trendy activity, and one should not mistakenly believe that trying it once is harmless. In addition to continuing to strengthen law enforcement, including targeting online drug trafficking, the Police will continue to nurture young anti-drug leaders through the Leadership Institute on Narcotics (L.I.O.N.), promoting a drug-free culture in communities, schools and families.

In regard to child protection, the Police are concerned about issues such as children being sexually extorted or defrauded online, and even being sexually assaulted. In the first eight months of this year, 57 cases of “online child sexual grooming” were recorded. Mr Chow appealed to schools and parents to collaborate in equipping young people with self-protection awareness and helping them understand the risks of the virtual world. The Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance will come into effect on January 20, 2026. The Police have been proactively launching publicity and educational initiatives to help professionals understand their roles and responsibilities, with a view to establishing an effective safety net to protect children from abuse and ensuring the timely handling of child abuse cases.

A total of 28 379 deception cases were recorded in the first eight months of this year, while the monetary loss decreased by 14.5 per cent year-on-year to $5.02 billion. Mr Chow stated that the Police, along with various stakeholders, have adopted a comprehensive strategy to combat and prevent deception cases, which gradually shows results. However, the number of cases remains high, with some involving significant financial losses. The Police constantly refine their strategies, including strengthening efforts to dismantle the fraud industry chain, enhance anti-scam publicity, and foster international co-operation. Additionally, the Police will launch an optimised version of the Scameter+, featuring automatic updates to the fraud database and real-time AI detection and reporting to expedite warnings to the public.

In the first eight months of this year, there were 270 phone scam cases involving post-secondary students, with losses over $100 million. In the new academic year, the Police have strengthened anti-scam publicity targeting post-secondary students, including co-ordinating with institutions to encourage new students to complete online learning modules and organising over 30 seminars and activities. The Police will continue to work closely with the banking industry and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to promote anti-scam awareness and implement various anti-deception measures.

Mr Chow also reminded members of the public to heed the Police’s anti-money laundering warnings and always remember not to be greedy for bargains, as well as not to rent, lend or sell their personal bank accounts. The Police will collaborate with the Department of Justice to expedite prosecutions of money laundering cases and apply to the courts for enhanced penalties. In the first eight months of this year, 122 individuals convicted of money laundering have had their sentences increased by the courts, with sentence durations extended by over 30 per cent at maximum. In 2024, 44 convicted individuals had their sentences increased by the courts.

Mr Chow expressed sincere gratitude to community leaders from the Hong Kong Shine Tak Foundation and the L.I.O.N. for their support to the Anti-Crime Elite Games, as well as the participation of various public and private organisations and schools, that contributed to the building of a safer community and safeguarding the next generation of Hong Kong.

Other officiating guests at the kick-off ceremony included the Chairman of the Hong Kong Shine Tak Foundation, Mr Lam Kwok-hing; the Principal President of L.I.O.N., Mr Kerry Wong; the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Operations), Mr Yip Wan-lung; the Director of Crime and Security, Mr Chan Tung, etc.

In addition to game booths, the two-day event also features music performance, dancing, magic shows, Police Pipe Band parades and demonstrations by the Police Dog Unit. The participating units from the Crime Wing include the Narcotics Bureau, the Family Conflict and Sexual Violence Policy Unit, the Commercial Crime Bureau, the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as the Financial Intelligence and Investigation Bureau.

警務處舉辦「滅罪精英運動會」（附圖）,2025-10-18 20:07,2025-10-18 20:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800665.htm,"警務處刑事部今明兩日（十月十八日及十九日）在西九文化區舉辦「滅罪精英運動會」，透過融入運動元素的多項活動，向公眾傳達禁毒、保護兒童、網絡安全、反詐騙及反洗黑錢信息。

警務處處長周一鳴在啓動儀式上致辭時表示，要做好防罪滅罪工作，為年青人的成長護航，不能單靠警隊的努力，而是要集合各持份者的力量，相輔相成，集思廣益，以應對複雜多變的罪案形勢。

今年首八個月青少年因干犯刑事罪行而被捕的人數持續改善，較去年同期下跌一成至1 742人，當中涉及洗黑錢和詐騙案件被捕人數分別跌50%及32.4%；然而，嚴重毒品和非禮的被捕人數分別升45.2%及33.3%。

周一鳴指，依托咪酯已成為不同年齡層最常吸食的毒品，其次為大麻和可卡因。他強調吸毒就是吸毒，絕不是潮流玩意，更不要誤以為一試無妨。警方除繼續加強執法力度，包括針對網上販毒的情況外，亦會透過禁毒領袖學院培養青年禁毒領袖，將無毒文化帶入社區、校園和家庭。

在保護兒童方面，警方關注兒童在網上被色情勒索、詐騙，甚至遭性侵的問題，今年首八個月共錄得57宗涉及「兒童網上性誘識」個案。周一鳴呼籲家校必須共同配合，協助年青人建立自我保護意識，認清虛擬世界的風險。另外，《強制舉報虐待兒童條例》將於二○二六年一月二十日正式生效，警方積極開展宣傳及教育工作，協助專業人士理解新法例下的角色和責任，致力為保護兒童免受虐待建立有效安全網，並確保虐兒個案得到及時處理。

今年首八個月錄得28 379宗詐騙案，損失金額較去年同期下跌14.5%至50.2億元。周一鳴表示，警方與各持份者採取全方位策略打擊及預防騙案，漸見成效，但案件數字仍處於較高水平，更有個別案件涉及大額損失。警方的應對策略不斷精益求精，包括加強打擊詐騙產業鏈、反詐宣傳及國際合作的力度。警方亦將推出「防騙視伏App」優化版，新功能涵蓋自動更新詐騙數據庫及人工智能實時檢測舉報，以加快為市民作出預警。

今年首八個月共有270宗涉及專上院校學生的電話騙案，損失金額超過一億元。警方在新學年特別加強針對專上學生的防騙宣傳，包括協調院校鼓勵新生完成網上學習套件及舉行超過30場講座和活動。警方會繼續與銀行業界及香港金融管理局緊密合作，推廣防騙意識和推出不同的防詐措施。

他亦提醒市民留意警方的反洗黑錢宣傳，時刻緊記便宜莫貪，個人銀行戶口「唔租、唔借、唔賣」。他指，警方會與律政司合作，就洗黑錢案件加快檢控，並向法庭申請加重刑罰。今年首八個月，已有122名因洗黑錢被定罪的人士被法庭加刑，較二○二四年全年44人增加接近兩倍，刑期最多增加超過三成。

周一鳴衷心感謝香港善德基金會及禁毒領袖學院的社會賢達鼎力支持「滅罪精英運動會」，以及各公私營機構和學校參與，為締造更安全的社區、守護香港的下一代貢獻力量。

其他出席啓動儀式的主禮嘉賓包括香港善德基金會主席藍國慶、禁毒領袖學院首席會長黃錦財、警務處副處長（行動）葉雲龍、刑事及保安處處長陳東等。

一連兩日的活動除攤位遊戲外，還包括多項音樂、舞蹈和魔術表演、警察風笛隊巡遊及警犬隊演示。參與活動的刑事部單位包括毒品調查科、家庭衝突及性暴力政策組、商業罪案調查科、網絡安全及科技罪案調查科，以及財富情報及調查科。有關活動詳情，請瀏覽滅罪精英運動會網頁（www.police.gov.hk/ppp_tc/04_crime_matters/adcc/aceg2025.html）。

FSD holds Save Lives x Emergency Response Ceremony cum Carnival (with photos),2025-10-18 19:03,2025-10-18 19:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101700293.htm,"The Fire Services Department (FSD) held the Save Lives x Emergency Response Ceremony cum Carnival at The Wai in Tai Wai today (October 18). The event aimed to appeal to the public to save lives in emergencies through various activities, including commendations for organisations and members of the public and an introduction to the FSD Community Emergency Responder (FSDCER) Scheme, as well as interactive experiences, game booths and drama performances.

In his remarks, the Director of Fire Services, Mr Andy Yeung, said that there areabout 8 000 cases ofout-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Hong Kong each year, an average of about 22 cases per day. The chance of saving lives is significantly higher if members of the public can perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use an automated external defibrillator (AED) in a timely manner. Mr Yeung showed his appreciation for the enthusiastic response from all sectors to the FSD's AED Anywhere for Anyone (AAA) Programme. The number of AEDs available for public use has grown from around 1 000 in 2021 to over 3 700 to date, installed by more than 370 organisations across the city. This year, the FSD has also focused on installing AEDs in common areas of public housing estates to expand AED coverage.

Mr Yeung conferred the Big Heart Award - Social Responsibility Award to 26 organisations in recognition of their contribution to promoting the AAA Programme. The Assistant Director (Ambulance) of the FSD, Mr Henry Kwok, presented the Save Heart Award to 21 members of the public who courageously assisted individuals in cardiac arrest during emergencies.

To strengthen community efforts in promoting CPR and AED usage, the FSD established the Resuscitation Alliance (RA) in collaboration with organisations that provide related training or emergency services. With the Scout Association of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association joining the RA today, the number of RA member organisations has increased to 11. As of June this year, over 230 000 members of the public have completed training offered by the RA, meaning one in every 32 people in Hong Kong has pledged to offer aid if encountering a person suffering cardiac arrest. Since early 2025, over 20 members of the RA have assisted in saving lives in cardiac arrest cases.

The FSD has provided training under the FSDCER Scheme to over 1 600 volunteer leaders of the 15th National Games to enhance public safety during the Games period.

The FSD this year will set up 10 CPR & AED Self-learning Kiosks across the community. Through self-learning with the aid of high-fidelity patient simulators designated for CPR training, AED simulators and interactive virtual scenarios, members of the public can practice and receive an instant evaluation powered by artificial intelligence. Public members of all ages participated in self-learning sessions at the experience zone set up at the event venue today.

The event was organised by the FSD and co-organised by 10 RA member organisations, namely the Auxiliary Medical Service, the Civil Aid Service, the Hospital Authority, the Hong Kong College of Cardiology, the Hong Kong Red Cross, the Hong Kong St John Ambulance, the Resuscitation Council of Hong Kong, the Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndromes (SADS) Hong Kong Foundation, the Scout Association of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Girl Guides Association. The event was funded by The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust as a key initiative under the Hong Kong Fire Services Department Disaster Management Programme. The FSDCER Scheme and the CPR & AED Self-learning Kiosks are also funded by The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust."
消防處舉行「救心x應急」頒獎禮暨嘉年華（附圖）,2025-10-18 19:03,2025-10-18 19:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101700290.htm,"消防處今日（十月十八日）在大圍圍方舉行「救心x應急」頒獎禮暨嘉年華，透過嘉許機構和市民、「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」簡介、互動體驗、攤位遊戲、話劇等精彩環節，向市民宣揚遇到緊急情況出手救人的信息。

消防處處長楊恩健致辭時指出，香港每年約有8 000宗院外心臟驟停個案，平均每日約有22宗，市民若能及時以心肺復甦法（CPR）和自動心臟除顫器（AED）為患者急救，很大機會可以拯救生命。楊恩健指，有賴各界積極響應消防處「AED睇得到用得到」計劃，可供公眾使用的AED已由二○二一年約1 000部增加至現時超過3 700部，並由超過370間機構在全港安裝。消防處今年亦聚焦在公營房屋的公共空間增設AED，進一步提升覆蓋率。

楊恩健向26間積極參與計劃的機構頒發「『有心機構』社會責任獎」，表揚其推行計劃的貢獻。消防處助理處長（救護）郭健民亦頒發「『救心仁』獎」，表揚21位在緊急情況下勇於為心臟驟停者施救的市民。

為凝聚社區力量推廣CPR和AED，消防處聯同多個提供有關訓練或急救服務的機構組成「救心同仁」聯盟，隨着香港童軍總會和香港女童軍總會今日正式加入，成員機構數目增至11間。截至今年六月，超過23萬名市民已完成「救心同仁」聯盟課程，即全港每32名市民就有一位承諾在遇上心臟驟停事故時會施以援手。根據二○二五年年初至今的紀錄，已有超過20位「救心同仁」成員於心臟驟停事故中出手，協助拯救生命。

此外，消防處已為超過1 600名第十五屆全國運動會義工領袖提供「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」訓練，以提升全運會舉辦期間的公眾安全。

消防處今年會在社區設置10部「救心自學站」，讓市民透過高仿真CPR訓練模型和AED模擬器配合互動虛擬場景自我學習，並透過人工智能即時評估。活動現場設有體驗專區，吸引不同年齡層市民參與。

活動由消防處主辦，醫療輔助隊、民眾安全服務隊、醫院管理局、香港心臟專科學院、香港紅十字會、香港聖約翰救護機構、香港心肺復蘇委員會、遺傳性心律基金會、香港童軍總會以及香港女童軍總會10個「救心同仁」聯盟成員協辦，並獲香港賽馬會慈善信託基金捐助，屬「香港消防處災難防控計劃」重點項目。「消防處社區應急先鋒計劃」和「救心自學站」亦由香港賽馬會慈善信託基金捐助。"

As part of Hong Kong Week 2025@Seoul, the programme features screenings of productions by emerging Hong Kong filmmakers, restored versions of Hong Kong classics and a series of industry exchange activities to reflect the city's diverse cinematic representations to Korean filmmakers and audiences, thereby fostering cultural exchanges between the two places.

Speaking at the opening reception on October 17, the Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries, Miss Drew Lai, expressed her gratitude to the Korean film industry and audiences for their support of Hong Kong film. She said, ""Film is a universal language that plays a vital role in strengthening cultural exchanges. In the past few years, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government has supported the screening of Hong Kong films in Korea for several times. ""Montages of a Modern Motherhood"" and ""Measure in Love"" (funded by the Film Development Fund (FDF)) were selected for the Busan International Film Festival last year and this year respectively. We are delighted to see that Hong Kong films are gaining increasing recognition at film festivals in Korea and beyond."" Miss Lai added that the films selected for Making Waves combine the old and new with multiple themes from Hong Kong cinema, showcasing the captivating cityscapes and rich and nuanced culture of Hong Kong. She hoped that the film choices will resonate deeply with audiences.

The film list for Making Waves includes ""Last Song For You"", as well as ""My First of May"", ""The Last Dance"", ""Papa"", ""Stuntman"", ""Peg O' My Heart"", ""Four Trails"", ""Mad Fate"", and restored classics ""A Moment of Romance"" and ""Shanghai Blues"". Over half of the 10 titles were directed by emerging filmmakers. Four of the 10 were supported by the FDF, namely, ""Last Song for You"", ""Papa"", ""Stuntman"" and ""Peg O' My Heart"". With support from the FDF, the CCIDA works hand in hand with the industry to nurture local film talent and drive innovation in Hong Kong's filmmaking.

Making Waves also sponsors the in-person participation of emerging Hong Kong directors and actors. The Director of the opening film, ""Last Song for You"", Jill Leung, and actor Natalie Hsu attended a sharing session after the screening to engage with some 300 Korean filmmakers and audiences. The Director of ""My First of May"", James Hung; actor of ""Papa"" Dylan So; Co-directors of ""Stuntman"" Albert Leung and Herbert Leung; and the Director of ""Four Trails"", Robin Lee, will all have interaction sessions with audiences that will take place after screenings of their respective films.

Making Waves is sponsored by the CCIDA and presented by the Hong Kong International Film Festival Society. Since its launch in 2022, the programme has visited 24 cities worldwide, bringing Hong Kong's unique cinematic representations to film practitioners and audiences in those places. By showcasing productions of new-generation Hong Kong filmmakers, the programme enhances their exposure to the international market, forging more business opportunities for Hong Kong's film industry.

The CCIDA also held discussions in Korea with several Korean cultural and creative industry organisations, including the Korea Creative Content Agency, the Busan International Film Festival, the Producers Guild of Korea, and the Korean Film Archive, to explore future collaboration opportunities."

​基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-18 17:30,2025-10-18 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800502.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月十八日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新個案資料

首宗個案涉及一名17歲女子，住所位於西貢區。初步調查顯示，她於十月十日至十二日到訪廣東省佛山市。她在十月十六日出現發燒、關節痛和皮疹，到將軍澳醫院急症室求醫。她的三名家居接觸者曾一同到佛山市，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

​第二宗個案涉及一名55歲男子，住所位於葵青區。初步調查顯示，他於十月八日至十三日獨自到訪廣東省清遠市。他十月十五日出現發燒和關節痛，十月十七日到瑪嘉烈醫院急症室求醫。他有三名家居接觸者，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

兩名病人均獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他們的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應。由於他們在潛伏期曾到訪廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

最新監測數據

本港今年累計錄得41宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：
• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。
​
​中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：
• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；

Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-18 17:30,2025-10-18 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800503.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 18), two new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest case information

  The first case involves a 17-year-old female living in Sai Kung District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Foshan in Guangdong province between October 10 and 12. She developed a fever, joint pain and rash on October 16, and sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital on the same day. The patient's three household contacts, who travelled with her to Foshan, are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.
â
âThe second case involves a 55-year-old male living in Kwai Tsing District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Qingyuan in Guangdong province alone from October 8 to 13. He has developed fever and joint pain since October 15. He sought medical attention at the Accident and Emergency Department of Prince Margaret Hospital on October 17. The patient has three household contacts, who are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

   Both patients were admitted to the hospital for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing. Since they stayed in Guangdong Province during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigations are ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.
  
Latest surveillance data

  So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 41 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
  The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.
  
  Additionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

  Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.
  
  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the CHP and the Travel Health Service, the latest Travel Health News, tips for using insect repellents, and the CHP Facebook Page, Instagram Account and YouTube Channel, and also the Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page of the FEHD."

​勞工及福利局局長為「心連心」廣東代表處開幕暨粵港澳大灣區社會服務合作項目簽約典禮主禮致辭（只有中文）（附圖）,2025-10-18 16:55,2025-10-18 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800512.htm,"以下是勞工及福利局局長孫玉菡今日（十月十八日）下午在「心連心」廣東代表處開幕暨粵港澳大灣區社會服務合作項目簽約典禮主禮的致辭全文：

尊敬的王利春部長（廣東省委社工部副部長）、周和博士（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室（中聯辦）社會工作部副部長）、管牧（香港社福界「心連心」大行動主席、立法會議員管浩鳴）、還有譚贛蘭教授（香港社福界「心連心」大行動副主席、「心連心」學院院長）、各位來賓、各位朋友：

今日我很高興出席「心連心」廣東代表處的開幕典禮，以及見證粵港澳大灣區社會服務合作項目的簽約儀式，這是「心連心」成立以來其中一個重要的標誌性發展。

「心連心」成立之初主要是連繫香港本地的社福機構，隨着「心連心」的壯大發展，隨着粵港澳大灣區一體化發展，以往是指經濟融合，其實在社福方面，大灣區的互相借鑑、互相融合，都有很多機遇。我在此非常多謝「心連心」，多謝廣東省社會工作部、廣東省大灣區九市的社工部、社工局，也多謝中聯辦，通過過去一段時間的齊心合作，促成今日第一是廣東代表處的成立，第二在成立典禮外，具體有101個項目，牽涉到45間香港的社福機構，有82個是廣東及澳門機構，主要以廣東為主。今日簽約的項目和這101個項目涵蓋了在大灣區九市，我也知道九個城市也有派代表參與，在此我向他們表達衷誠的致謝，很感謝他們抽空來到香港，和我們一起見證今日這個重要的儀式和項目。

「心連心」在廣東有三家代表處，最近我們的在前海，另一個在羅湖，兩個都很近，另一個在廣州海心沙，我親自去了前海的辦事處揭幕，希望有機會也可以去羅湖和在廣州的海心沙代表處。有了「心連心」的代表處後，香港的社福機構和在廣東、尤其是大灣區為主的社福機構的合作，就會更加便利。「心連心」可以作為中間的樞紐，讓大家之間溝通交往，繼而這次有很多服務。當然我們不會自己到內地提供服務，但是跟機構合作的時候，香港的社福機構專業人員可以到內地提供訓練，或者從旁指導，分享經驗，可以切切實實將我們社福的經驗用在大灣區。

我理解今天101個項目牽涉了每一個環節，譬如大家都緊張的精神健康、安老、青少年服務、家庭服務、殘疾人士和復康等，通通都包括在內，待會簽約過程中大家會看得到。這是很好的事，通過我們社福的合作，可以拉近大灣區各自之間的距離，並通過實質項目的合作，建立深厚的友誼和互信，為我們將來的進一步發展打好基礎。

說到大灣區發展，我藉此機會提提其中一個標誌性，由社會福利署做的，在大灣區的廣東院舍照顧服務計劃。如果大家熟悉養老和安老事務就知道，過去我們很多年只有兩家安老院，一家在深圳、一家在肇慶，但隨着過去兩、三年不斷努力，到今日已經有24家院舍遍佈在大灣區差不多九市，只差一個市很快也會有，現時有八個市，香港長者如果想上去大灣區安老，選擇真的很多。現時一共有650位長者已選擇入住，當中13間由香港機構有份參與營運，11間是純屬內地營運，各適其適，適合就可以了。

我在這裏藉此機會祝願今日的簽署合作項目可以早日落地，為粵港澳大灣區的社會服務注入新的動力。相信只要我們一起攜手合力的話，一定可以實現在社福機構和社福服務方面的大灣區的融合。今日只是起步，我相信在不久的將來會見到很實質的成果。我們社福界做事很實在，說完之後就去做，通過我們的實踐，通過我們項目的成果來實現這方面的工作，多謝大家！"

SEE attends Belt and Road Green Innovation Conference in Beijing (with photos),2025-10-18 16:29,2025-10-18 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101800499.htm,"The Secretary for Environment and Ecology, Mr Tse Chin-wan, attended the Belt and Road Green Innovation Conference 2025 held in Beijing today (October 18) to share Hong Kong's experiences in green innovation and directions of promoting environmental protection co-operation with the Belt and Road (B&R) counterparts.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the conference, Mr Tse said that the world is facing severe challenges such as climate change in recent years. All parties must adhere to the green development concept, ramp up green transition of the society, and collaboratively reduce carbon emissions and pollution, as well as restore and expand ecology. Green innovation has hence become an important driving force for sustainable development in Hong Kong. It not only promotes new areas of economic growth but also creates job opportunities, fostering social prosperity and development.

""Under the 'one country, two systems', Hong Kong has the distinctive advantages of enjoying strong support of the Motherland and being closely connected to the world, fully leveraging our role as a 'super-connector' and promoting green development for our country and B&R countries,"" Mr Tse said.

Mr Tse highlighted that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will set up a B&R sustainable green development training centre next year to cultivate international environmental protection talent. The centre will serve as a base to connect the HKSAR with the international sustainable green development co-operation network, creating an environment that promotes technological exchange and outcome transfer for B&R counterparts.

Mr Tse added that the HKSAR Government is proactively preparing for the setup of a B&R Green Development Co-operation Platform in Hong Kong with the B&R Initiative International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC). The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) will establish a regular communication and collaboration mechanism with the BRIGC to facilitate exchanges and discussions with environmental authorities, related organisations and enterprises of the B&R countries, strengthening the international environmental protection co-operation network.

The HKSAR Government holds the Eco Expo Asia at the end of October every year and utilises it as a platform to arrange environmental technology forums and site visits to Chinese Mainland, as well as to strengthen exchange and co-operation. Mr Tse introduced that the 20th Eco Expo Asia to be held in October this year will arrange for representatives from B&R countries to visit outstanding environmental enterprises and facilities in Changsha of Hunan Province. The aim is to more effectively promote green international exchanges and to seek opportunities for high-quality green enterprises from Chinese Mainland to ""go global"".

The Director of Environmental Protection, Dr Samuel Chui, also attended the conference. He delivered a keynote speech at a sub-forum titled ""Jointly Building Beautiful Cities, Empowering Green Infrastructure with a New Future"" in the afternoon. He introduced the Hong Kong Environmental Database developed by the EPD, showcasing how to enhance environmental assessment and improve efficiency through digital empowerment.

The Belt and Road Green Innovation Conference 2025 was hosted by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, and organised by the BRIGC and the Foreign Environmental Cooperation Center of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The theme for this year is ""Driving Green Development Together"", aligning with the core agenda of the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The conference focuses on the achievements of the Green Silk Road building, building of platforms for exchange and co-operation in green finance, green and low-carbon development, as well as green technology and innovation, which aims to facilitate the integration of green industries with technologies.

Mr Tse will return to Hong Kong this evening."
行政長官在行業模範之星評選頒獎典禮致辭（只有中文）（附短片）,2025-10-18 16:00,2025-10-18 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/18/P2025101700292.htm,"以下是行政長官李家超今日（十月十八日）在行業模範之星評選頒獎典禮的視像致辭：

吳秋北會長（香港工會聯合會會長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友、各位打工仔女：

大家好！很高興以視頻方式，參與今日的頒獎典禮，恭賀各位「模範之星」在評選中脫穎而出。你們在各行各業以優秀表現閃耀職場，為行業注入動力，為社會樹立榜樣，努力值得肯定。

習近平主席指出，長期以來，勞動模範和先進工作者在促進事業發展、推動時代進步中發揮了示範引領作用。我感謝香港工會聯合會籌辦評選活動，表彰香港行業翹楚盡忠職守、精益求精的精神，不僅弘揚敬業樂業的崇高價值，亦展現敢於創新突破的時代風貌。

在九月公布的《世界人才排名》中，香港由去年的第九位大幅躍升至第四位，是歷來最高排名，更是亞洲之冠。香港勞工專業勤奮、務實靈活，是社會發展和經濟騰飛的重要基石，貢獻遍及各個角落。從民生服務到專業領域，從基礎建設到創科前沿，香港的繁榮足跡，實在有賴廣大打工仔女的智慧與汗水，共同推動社會進步，造福千家萬戶。

改善民生，是我施政的最終目標，因此政府會竭力穩定就業。特區政府一向重視勞工權益，我在新一份《施政報告》中，提出一系列保障措施，包括打擊濫用補充勞工優化計劃、加強個別工種在勞工處招募地點實地招聘，並嚴格限制輸入勞工比例，加大力度打擊非法勞工，以確保本地勞工優先就業。我們亦會完善數碼平台工作者的保障，以及持續加強職業安全及健康。

面對產業轉型加速、科技日新月異，特區政府致力為勞工賦能增值。我們會革新僱員再培訓局，助力勞動人口與時並進，提升競爭力，壯大人才庫。政府將優化再就業津貼試行計劃，釋放本地潛在勞動力。

今年四月，國家舉行全國勞動模範和先進工作者表彰大會，肯定各行業的精英和專家的貢獻。為促進兩地勞動人才經驗交流互鑑，特區政府特別邀請中華全國總工會，組織全國勞動模範和大國工匠代表團下星期訪港。屆時各位國家勞動模範和大國工匠會現身說法，向香港社會分享奮鬥故事與傑出成就。我相信，他們的榜樣力量，能夠鼓勵廣大僱員再接再厲、奮發向上。

香港工會聯合會今次舉辦的活動，表彰行業卓越之風，與國家推崇的勞動模範精神一脈相承。工聯會一直心繫基層，關心廣大打工仔女的權益，並鼓勵他們力爭上游，我肯定你們的貢獻。

各位朋友，勞動創造價值，奮鬥成就未來。我期望各位繼續在自身崗位發光發熱，力爭上游，攜手為行業的進步、為香港的明天努力打拼，續創輝煌。我祝願各位打工仔女事業進步、家庭幸福！多謝大家。"
