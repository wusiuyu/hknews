 Launched in 2023, the BugHunting Campaign aims to assist resource-limited SMEs in enhancing their cybersecurity protection and strengthen Hong Kong’s overall cybersecurity. The campaign this year will run from July to August.

 As artificial intelligence (AI) technology rapidly integrates into various business operations, enterprises enjoying greater efficiency also face growing cybersecurity threats. The BugHunting Campaign 2025 will recruit cybersecurity professionals to conduct free vulnerability assessments for local SMEs, by utilising AI-powered technology and a bounty-based vulnerability detection model. Additionally, security audits will also be conducted on their AI applications to prevent data breaches and provide comprehensive defences against emerging cyber threats.

 The crowdsourced vulnerability detection platform CyberBay employs a secure identity and credential verification system that aligns with banking standards. All participating cybersecurity professionals must pass technical assessments and background checks to ensure their expertise and integrity. Certified cybersecurity professionals, known as ""bounty hunters"", will provide safe and high-quality vulnerability detection services to local enterprises.

 The campaign has received an overwhelming response over the past two years, with over 210 SMEs participating. This year, additional resources will be allocated to provide participating enterprises with detailed inspection reports and complimentary one-on-one professional consultation services to address their vulnerabilities more effectively. Enterprises that demonstrate a solid cybersecurity foundation or successfully remediate vulnerabilities within a specified timeframe will be honored with an official BugHunting 2025 digital badge, recognising their commitment to cybersecurity excellence. Furthermore, cybersecurity awareness training will be offered to employees of participating enterprises to enhance their skills and vigilance in preventing data breaches.

 Further details of the campaign and registration arrangements are available on the relevant websites (cyberdefender.hk/en-us/bughunting_campaign_2025/) and (cyberbay.tech/events/protectHK2025).

Showcasing an incredible sense of musical unity, the concert promises an acoustic feast that interweaves classical and crossover music.

  In 1972, a radio production of Julius Klengel's ""Hymnus"" for 12 cellos with members of the Berliner Philharmoniker's cello section provided the impetus for the founding of a soloist ensemble of this calibre. The upcoming concert will open with this seminal piece, followed by the ensemble's first commissioned work, Boris Blacher's ""Blues, Espagnola, Rumba Philharmonica"". The programme also includes Fauré's ""Pavane, Op. 50"", Jean Françaix's ""Aubade - Presto"" and Stephan Koncz's ""Swing on DvoÅák"".

文化體育及旅遊局局長：香港有很多人學鋼琴，從小到大我們人人都學鋼琴，所以有關支援或香港的鋼琴師資，我想是很好的。首先，再次恭喜靖韜，可以在Van Cliburn（梵．克萊本）鋼琴大賽，我知道這是每四年一屆（舉行），也是非常高水平的鋼琴比賽中拿到冠軍，擊敗了二十多、三十名來自不同地方的好手，首先非常恭喜他。我知道大家都稱他為「鋼琴神童」，三歲就開始學琴，十歲已開始去比賽，成績一向很好。我想這個應該對我們的音樂界，不只是鋼琴，在香港的所有學樂器的朋友，其實都是很大的鼓舞，說明我們有努力、天份的話，衝出國際並不是一個夢想，而是一個事實。

記者：局長，想問其實有四大國際賽事，他贏了這一項賽事，對香港市民有甚麼特別的意義呢？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：首先，我們每一次無論是鋼琴比賽、其他音樂比賽或是體育及其他盛事，香港的好手可以在國際揚威的話，對於香港來說都是很振奮、開心和很驕傲。我在社交媒體上都說feeling proud of Aristo（對沈靖韜感到驕傲）。

記者：其實根據資料，藝發局（香港藝術發展局）一直對鋼琴有資助，如果他今次贏了冠軍，會否多放資源在鋼琴方面？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：我也會去了解藝發局對於鋼琴和其他的樂器的資助情況是否足夠，但相信能夠在國際揚威，都會見到我們對於香港的藝術家，或者年輕的藝術家是有資助、有栽培，我們亦是與他們同行的。

記者：有意見指，會否針對這些特別有藝術天賦的人，設立一些專門的學校給他們就讀？當局會否考慮？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：其實現時我們大專院校的音樂系都很強。另外，我知道在香港，就算我們自己學琴，其實我們都有很多不同的國際上，或者是內地很強的音樂學院，我們都會去學習，也都會去考這些文憑，所以我們現在做的事情一定會加強。

記者：想追問藝發局的問題。不同樂器都有受到藝發局的資助，但有不少的受資助者都說申請其實很困難。會否擔心其實如果投放多些在鋼琴方面的資助，會變成一種類似「勝利樂壇」的感覺？

文化體育及旅遊局局長：是的，所以我說其實藝發局對不同的樂器都有很好的資助。在香港學樂器，其實不論是鋼琴、小提琴或甚至是我們的中樂，其實不同的樂器都有很多朋友去學習，所以我認為百花齊放是好事，多謝各位。"
警務處舉辦「提子五歲防騙生日派對」推廣防騙信息（附圖）,2025-06-08 18:44,2025-06-08 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/08/P2025060800658.htm,"  警務處今日（六月八日）在金鐘夏慤花園舉辦「提子五歲防騙生日派對」，慶祝防騙吉祥物「提子」誕生五周年，並透過互動遊戲及趣味挑戰，提升市民防騙意識。

防騙吉祥物「提子」在二○二○年首次亮相，寓意市民要提防騙子，提升防騙意識，提醒身邊親友防騙訊息。

警務處處長周一鳴在活動上致辭時表示，警隊在過去五年舉辦多項線上線下的「提子」防騙宣傳活動，隨着相關宣傳工作的推廣及社會各界的努力，騙案數字按年增幅已由二○二○年的近九成，放緩至去年的11.7%。今年首四個月與比去年同期相比，騙案數字雖然上升了9%，但損失金額下跌三成，反映市民的防騙意識有所提升。

周一鳴指，防騙工作需要全社會共同參與，騙案猶如病毒，防騙宣傳則好比疫苗，市民主動接收防騙資訊就像接種疫苗，起防範作用。他強調，只有大家齊心協力，才能讓騙徒無機可乘。

今日的活動設有多個互動環節，包括提防騙子遊戲、「提子」人偶快閃。此外，為慶祝「提子」五歲生日，警方特別舉辦「提子防騙急口令」大賽，以四句簡單易記的急口令，加強市民的防騙意識。

展望未來，警隊會持續優化防騙宣傳策略，「提子」將繼續創新求變，透過更多元化的活動與市民互動，與社會各界攜手構建更堅固的防騙屏障。"

"HKPF holds ""The Little Grape's 5th Anti-Scam Birthday Party"" to promote scam prevention messages (with photos)",2025-06-08 18:43,2025-06-08 20:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/08/P2025060800657.htm,"The Hong Kong Police Force held ""The Little Grape's 5th Anti-Scam Birthday Party"" today (June 8) at Harcourt Garden in Admiralty to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the anti-scam mascot, ""The Little Grape"". Through interactive games and fun challenges, the event aimed to boost public awareness of scam prevention.

Launched in 2020, the anti-scam mascot emphasises the importance of vigilance against scammers, promotes public awareness, and encourages the sharing of anti-scam information with family and friends.

Speaking at the event, the Commissioner of Police, Mr Chow Yat-ming, said that over the past five years, the Police have organised numerous online and offline promotional activities featuring ""The Little Grape"". Thanks to these initiatives and the collective efforts of the community, the annual growth rate of scam cases has significantly slowed, declining from nearly 90 per cent in 2020 to 11.7 per cent last year. While the number of scam cases increased by 9 per cent in the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year, financial losses dropped by 30 per cent, indicating a rise in public awareness of scam prevention.

Mr Chow noted that combating scams requires the collective effort of the entire community. He compared scams to viruses and anti-scam publicity campaign to vaccines. When citizens proactively absorb scam prevention information, they build immunity against deception, much like receiving a vaccine. He stressed that only collective action can effectively thwart scammers.

The event featured several interactive activities, including anti-scam games and a surprise flash mob by ""The Little Grape"" mascot. To mark the 5th anniversary of mascot, the Police also organised ""The Little Grape Anti-Scam Tongue Twister Contest”, using four simple and catchy tongue twisters to reinforce scam prevention awareness.

Looking ahead, the Police will continue to refine anti-scam promotional strategies. ""The Little Grape"" will remain innovative, engaging with the public through a diverse range of activities and collaborating with all sectors of society to build a stronger barrier against scams.

LD reminds employers and employees to take heat stroke preventive measures in times of Heat Stress at Work Warning,2025-06-08 13:10,2025-06-08 13:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/08/P2025060800386.htm,"âAs the Heat Stress at Work Warning is now in effect, the Labour Department (LD) reminds employers and employees to take appropriate measures during the effective period of the warning to prevent heat stroke when working in hot weather or hot environments.

Employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor environments face high levels of heat stress and are at a relatively higher risk of heat stroke. Employers should assess the risk factors of heat stress for employees at work and, based on the identified risk factors, take necessary preventive and control measures, including rescheduling work periods, setting up shading covers, providing ventilation and heat dissipation equipment, and reminding employees to replenish water and rest in a timely manner.

The Heat Stress at Work Warning is formulated by the LD based on the Hong Kong Heat Index. There are three levels of the warning: Amber, Red and Black, which help employers and employees better understand the level of heat stress while working outdoors or indoors without air-conditioning systems.

A spokesman for the LD said that when the department issues the Heat Stress at Work Warning, employers must refer to the criteria and recommendations provided in the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"" to conduct risk assessments, according to the workloads and other relevant heat stress risk factors, for employees who work outdoors or in non-air-conditioned indoor workplaces. Appropriate rest breaks should be arranged every hour, as far as reasonably practicable, based on various levels of the Heat Stress at Work Warning, to reduce employees' risk of heat stroke.

Employees must also follow instructions to rest on time. Whenever there are any symptoms of heat-related illnesses, such as headache, dizziness, thirst, and nausea, they should rest in a cool and shady place, drink water, and inform employers/supervisors to take appropriate action immediately.

The LD issued the ""Guidance Notes on Prevention of Heat Stroke at Work"", detailing the various risk factors that should be considered when conducting heat stress risk assessments and recommending corresponding control measures for identified risk factors for employers' and employees' reference. For the Heat Stress at Work Warning and related guidelines, please refer to the department's thematic webpage: www.labour.gov.hk/eng/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm."
勞工處提醒僱主及僱員在工作暑熱警告生效期間採取預防中暑措施,2025-06-08 13:10,2025-06-08 13:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/08/P2025060800385.htm,"由於工作暑熱警告現已生效，勞工處提醒僱主及僱員在警告生效期間採取適當措施，以預防在酷熱天氣下或高溫環境中工作而引致中暑。

在戶外或沒有空調的室內環境工作的僱員會面對高水平的熱壓力，中暑的風險亦相對較高。僱主應評估僱員工作時的熱壓力風險因素，並因應所識別的風險因素採取所需的預防及控制措施，包括重新編排工作時段、設置遮蔭上蓋、提供通風及散熱設備、提醒員工適時補充水分及休息。

工作暑熱警告是勞工處基於香港暑熱指數而制定，分為黃色、紅色和黑色工作暑熱警告，協助僱主僱員更容易明白在戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室內環境工作的熱壓力水平。

勞工處發言人表示，當勞工處發出工作暑熱警告時，僱主須在警告生效期間參照《預防工作時中暑指引》提供的準則和建議，為處於戶外或沒有設置空調系統的室内工作環境的僱員，根據其工作的勞動量和其他相關熱壓力風險因素所作出的評估，並在合理地切實可行的情況下按不同級別的工作暑熱警告每小時安排適當的休息時間，以減低僱員中暑的風險。

僱員亦須遵照指示按時休息，如工作期間出現熱疾病的症狀，例如頭痛、頭暈、口渴、噁心，應立即到陰涼處休息和飲水，並通知僱主／管方作出適當行動。

勞工處發布的《預防工作時中暑指引》，詳細說明進行熱壓力風險評估時應考慮的各項風險因素，並針對各風險因素建議相應的控制措施，供僱主和僱員參閱。有關工作暑熱警告及相關指引，請參閱勞工處專題網頁：www.labour.gov.hk/tc/news/prevention_of_heat_stroke_at_work.htm。"
