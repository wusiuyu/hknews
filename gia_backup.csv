政府公布宏福苑長遠居住安排方案,2026-02-21 18:29,2026-02-21 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/21/P2026022100429.htm,"政府今日（二月二十一日）公布大埔宏福苑長遠居住安排方案，涵蓋以現金向業主收購業權、「樓換樓」、預留居者有其屋計劃（居屋）、綠表置居計劃（綠置居）及香港房屋協會（房協）的單位供已出售業權的業主優先選購，以及在大埔頌雅路西興建新居屋，提供不同選項，讓受影響業主可以按情況及需要作出選擇，協助他們重建家園。

應急住宿安排工作組組長、財政司副司長黃偉綸說：「政府主要按以下原則制定長遠方案：要照顧受影響家庭的意願，情、理、法兼備，並以情為先；提供多元選項，讓居民『有得揀』；提供大埔原區長遠居住安排選項；以及要善用公共資源。政府現時提出的方案，提供不同的選項，受影響各戶可以按個別的需要以至喜好作出選擇，相信能夠更切合和照顧到不同家庭的情況。」

房屋局獨立審查組早前進行對宏福苑的勘察。經評估，七座受災樓宇（A-G座）在結構上雖然沒有即時倒塌的危險，但高溫大火已對樓宇多方面的功能造成大範圍、深層次、複雜而長遠的影響，難以作合理和符合成本效益的復修，最終需要全部拆卸。這個非常特殊的情況，並牽涉1 736個單位之多，目前沒有有效的市場機制可以處理。由政府介入並提出收購七座受災樓宇單位的業權，可以最快地解決受災家庭的長遠居住安排。

政府會向所有宏福苑A-G座單位的業主提出收購。以實用面積計算，未補價單位收購價每平方呎8,000元，已補價單位收購價每平方呎10,500元。全部單位均會採用以上的劃一標準。

黃偉綸說：「政府在訂定收購價時，主要是考慮到居民痛失家園，遭受重大損失，生活上面對重重困難，值得社會理解和支持。另外，宏福苑火災規模之大，影響之深，是香港前所未有的。我們為這個『特別中的特別』個案所作的安排，不會構成先例，而我們亦相信這個收購價，能夠讓受災家庭基本上有能力重置長遠居所。」

至於H座宏志閣，雖然仍有一些必要維修和管理安排需要處理，但基本上未有受大火波及。部分宏志閣的業主亦在不同場合表明，希望能返回原本單位長期居住。黃偉綸表示，由於宏志閣仍然可供居住，政府亦必須尊重私有產權，除非宏志閣業主能達成高度共識，希望政府的方案也能涵蓋宏志閣，否則政府難以作進一步介入。事實上，政府若只能零星收回小部分宏志閣的單位，地契、大廈公契、公用空間等問題仍然不會獲得妥善解決。因此，在現階段政府的購買業權方案不會包括宏志閣。不過，黃偉綸強調，如果宏志閣的業主們能夠達成高度共識，政府樂意與各業主進一步探討這個可能性。

業主向政府出售業權，收取收購金額後，可利用這筆現金，自行作長遠居住安排，或可以繼而透過政府為宏福苑業主而設的「特設銷售計劃」，購置全新資助出售單位。

房屋局局長何永賢說：「我們明白不少宏福苑居民都希望盡快購置長遠居所，香港房屋委員會（房委會）和房協將在八個原有發展項目中，預留2 400個單位，並會在大埔頌雅路西加建1 500個單位的新居屋項目。上述項目合共可提供3 900個單位，供已向政府出售業權的業主選購。」

進一步詳情如下：

房委會會在最新一期「出售居者有其屋計劃單位2025」和「出售綠表置居計劃單位2025」預留約2 000個單位，以「特設銷售計劃」形式，供已出售業權的業主選購。預留的居屋／綠置居單位主要來自以下發展項目，建議單位數目及預計參加這個計劃的業主入伙日期如下：


九龍灣盛緻苑（預計二○二六年第四季入伙－610單位）；
錦田匯熙苑（預計二○二七年第三季入伙－140單位）；
東涌裕豐苑（預計二○二七年第三季入伙－140單位）；
屏山朗風苑（預計二○二八年第三季入伙－140單位）；
啟德啟陽苑（預計二○二八年第四季入伙－750單位）；
將軍澳影輝苑（預計二○二八年第四季入伙－220單位）；


此外，考慮到有立法會議員和居民建議，可加入房協的單位作支援，在房屋局及發展局協調下，房協會提供400個單位，包括約100個位於粉嶺百和路項目的單位，預計於今年第四季入伙，以及300個位於觀塘安達臣道石礦場項目的單位，預計可於二○二八年首季入伙。

大埔原本未來數年並沒有居屋項目。為滿足部分居民希望在大埔原區重置居所的訴求，房委會將在大埔頌雅路西加建新居屋，提供合共1 500個單位。房委會正全力推展有關項目，預計第一期約900個單位，最快可於2029年入伙；第二期提供約600個單位，也可於其後十多個月後入伙。房委會特意修改設計，將項目的圖則改為主要提供實用面積400多平方呎的單位，與宏福苑單位現時面積相若。

「特設銷售計劃」將於今年九月開始選樓。政府明白業主希望可以盡早揀選心儀單位，因此他們選樓的先後次序會按照接受政府收購的日期分批而定。同一批次內的申請者的選樓次序，會再取決於按攪珠結果而排列的次序。

另外，長遠方案亦包括「樓換樓」方式。政府會提供「樓換樓券」代替現金，給願意出售業權的業主。「樓換樓券」等同收購金額的價值，並會作為業主日後參與「特設銷售計劃」、購買房委會或房協預留的資助出售單位時的「可用金額」。如業主選擇的單位價格較「可用金額」高，業主需額外補足差額；若選擇的單位價格較「可用金額」低，業主則可以收取相關的差額。簡而言之，在這安排下，政府會按收購價，代業主支付購買相關資助出售單位，當中如有差額，會以「多除少補」的方式處理。

無論選擇哪一個選項，業主須在八月三十一日或之前（即由今日起計約六個月內）確認其意向。

何永賢說：「政府理解業主要在一時之間，掌握長遠方案內各個選項的具體內容，實不容易。政府已成立由房屋局統籌的跨部門『解說專隊』。專隊成員超過100人，成員主要來自房屋局、勞工及福利局、民政及青年事務局、保安局，以及發展局的轄下部門。『解說專隊』會跟進各業主的整個收購過程，聚焦為業主提供支援，按個別需要，幫助業主了解不同選項的內容細節，解答業主的疑問，協助他們針對自身的情況作出選擇。」

房屋局會為「解說專隊」進行特別培訓，協助他們向業主解說政府具體長遠居住安排方案。透過「一戶一社工」的轉介，「解說專隊」會由三月初起，直接聯繫各戶業主。「解說專隊」部分成員亦會在較多宏福苑居民暫居的過渡性房屋及房協項目開設服務站，更方便地為有需要的宏福苑業主提供服務。"
Wang Fuk Court long-term housing arrangement plan announced,2026-02-21 18:29,2026-02-21 18:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/21/P2026022100433.htm,"The Government announced today (February 21) the plan for the long-term housing arrangements for Wang Fuk Court (WFC). The plan provides various options including the acquisition of titles from flat owners by cash, a ""Flat-for-Flat"" arrangement, and the reservation of flats under the Home Ownership Scheme (HOS), the Green Form Subsidised Home Ownership Scheme (GSH) and the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) projects for priority purchase by owners who have sold their titles. It also includes the construction of new HOS flats at Chung Nga Road West in Tai Po. The plan enables affected owners to make choices based on their circumstances and needs, assisting them in rebuilding their homes.

The Head of the Task Force on Emergency Accommodation Arrangements (Task Force) and Deputy Financial Secretary, Mr Michael Wong said, ""The Government formulates long-term plans based on the following principles: taking into account the wishes of affected families while balancing empathy, reason, the law with empathy as the priority; providing diverse options so that residents 'have a real choice'; providing a long-term housing option in Tai Po; and making efficient use of public resources. The current plan offered by the Government provides a range of options, allowing affected households to make decisions based on their individual needs and preferences, with the aim of better addressing and catering to the circumstances of different families.""

The Independent Checking Unit of the Housing Bureau (HB) has conducted an inspection of WFC. The assessment concluded that, although the seven affected blocks (Blocks A to G) do not face an immediate risk of structural collapse, the intense fire has caused extensive, deep, complex, and long-term damage to multiple building functions. This makes it difficult to carry out reasonable and cost-effective repairs, therefore complete demolition is necessary. In this special case of exceptional nature, involving as many as 1 736 flats, there is no effective market mechanism to deal with it at present. Through government intervention by making acquisition offers on titles of the seven affected buildings, the long-term housing arrangements of the affected families can be resolved in the most expeditious manner.

The Government will make acquisition offers to all owners of flats in Blocks A to G of WFC. The acquisition offer, calculated based on the saleable area, is $8,000 per square foot for flats with premium unpaid, and $10,500 per square foot for flats with premium paid. All the flats will be subject to the above uniform standard.

Mr Wong said, ""The Government's current acquisition price mainly takes into account that the residents have lost their homes and suffered significant losses. Their difficult circumstances warrant the understanding and support from society. Meanwhile, the scale and impact of the WFC fire are unprecedented in Hong Kong, therefore the arrangement made for this 'special case of exceptional nature' will not serve as a precedent. We also believe that the acquisition price will enable the affected families to relocate and secure long-term housing.""

For Wang Chi House (Block H), although certain necessary repair and management arrangements must be carried out, it was not affected by the fire. Some owners of Wang Chi House have, on different occasions, indicated their wish to resume long-term residence in their original units. Mr Wong said that as Wang Chi House can still provide accommodation, and the Government must respect private property rights, unless owners of Wang Chi House reach a high degree of consensus and would like the Government's plan to also cover Wang Chi House, it would be difficult for the Government to intervene further. In fact, if the Government was only able to acquire a small number of units in Wang Chi House, issues relating to land leases, building deeds of mutual covenant, or common areas could not be effectively resolved. Accordingly, the Government acquisition proposal does not cover Wang Chi House at this stage. However, Mr Wong stressed that, if owners of Wang Chi House are able to reach a high degree of consensus, the Government would be willing to further explore this possibility with them.

Upon selling their titles to the Government and receiving the acquisition payment, owners may use the cash to make their own long-term housing arrangements, or they may participate in the Special Sales Exercise dedicated for WFC owners to purchase new subsidised sale flats (SSF) afterwards.

The Secretary for Housing, Ms Winnie Ho, said, ""We understand that many residents wish to purchase long-term accommodation promptly. To facilitate this, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) and the HKHS will reserve a total of 2 400 flats in eight of their current projects, and the new HOS project at Chung Nga Road West in Tai Po will provide an additional 1 500 units. All the above projects together will provide a total of 3 900 flats for purchase by owners who have sold their titles to the Government.""

Further details as follows:

The HA will reserve approximately 2 000 flats under the latest Sale of HOS Flats 2025 and Sale of GSH Flats 2025 for purchase by owners who have sold their titles through the Special Sales Exercise. The reserved HOS/GSH flats are mainly drawn from the following development projects, and the proposed number of flats and expected intake dates for owners participating in the exercise are as follows:


Shing Chi Court, Kowloon Bay (expected intake by Q4 2026 - 610 units)
Wui Hei Court, Kam Tin (expected intake by Q3 2027 - 140 units)
Yu Fung Court, Tung Chung (expected intake by Q3 2027 - 140 units)
Long Fung Court, Ping Shan (expected intake by Q3 2028 - 140 units)
Kai Yeung Court, Kai Tak (expected intake by Q4 2028 - 750 units)
Ying Fai Court, Tseung Kwan O (expected intake by Q4 2028 - 220 units)


Additionally, in response to suggestions from Legislative Council Members and residents to include flats from the HKHS as part of the support measures, and following co-ordination by the HB and the Development Bureau (DEVB), the HKHS will provide around 400 flats. This includes approximately 100 from its project on Pak Wo Road in Fanling, which are scheduled for intake in Q4 this year, and about 300 from the Anderson Road Quarry site project in Kwun Tong, with intake expected to commence in the first quarter of 2028.

Originally, there were no HOS projects planned in Tai Po for the coming years. In response to the wish of some residents to relocate in Tai Po, the HA will pursue a new HOS project at Chung Nga Road West in Tai Po, providing a total of 1 500 flats. The HA is making every effort to implement the project, with the first phase of approximately 900 flats expected to be ready for intake at the earliest in 2029; the second phase will provide approximately 600 flats, which can also be ready for intake over 10 months later. The HA will specifically modify the design, changing the project's plans to mainly provide flats with saleable area of ​​over 400 square feet, similar in size to the current flats in WFC.

Flat selection under the Special Sales Exercise will commence in September 2026. The Government understands that owners wish to select their preferred flats as early as possible, and the flat selection priority will therefore be determined in batches according to the date on which they accept the Government's acquisition offer. The flat selection order for applicants within the same batch will be further determined by their sequence as drawn in a ballot.

The long-term housing plan also includes a ""Flat-for-Flat"" arrangement. The Government will issue a Flat-for-Flat Voucher in lieu of cash to owners willing to sell their titles. This voucher holds the same value as the acquisition amount and will serve as ""credits"" for owners when they join the Special Sales Exercise to purchase SSF reserved by the HA or the HKHS. If the price of the chosen flat exceeds the ""credits"", the owner needs to make up the difference. On the contrary, if the selected flat price is lower than the ""credit"", the owner may receive the corresponding balance. In short, under this arrangement, the Government will purchase an SSF flat on the owner's behalf at the same price as the acquisition price, and any price difference is to be settled by the owner on a ""pay more or get refunded"" basis.

Regardless of which option is chosen, the owner must confirm their intention by August 31 (i.e. about six months from today).

Ms Ho said, ""The Government understands that it is difficult for owners to grasp the specific details of each option in the long-term housing arrangements all at once. Therefore, the Government has established a cross-departmental 'engagement team' co-ordinated by the Housing Bureau. Composed of more than 100 people, the team members mainly come from departments under the HB, the Labour and Welfare Bureau, the Home and Youth Affairs Bureau, the Security Bureau and the DEVB. The 'engagement team' will follow up on the entire acquisition process of each owner, with a focus on providing support to owners. It will help owners understand the detailed content of the various options according to their individual needs, answer their questions and assist them in making choices based on their specific circumstances.""

The HB will provide special training for the ""engagement team"" to help them respond and explain the Government's plan for long-term housing arrangements to the owners effectively. Through referrals made under the ""one social worker per household"" service, the ""engagement team"" will directly contact individual owners starting from early March. Some members will also set up service counters at transitional housing and HKHS projects where a significant number of WFC residents are temporarily accommodated, providing consultation services to owners in need in a more convenient manner."
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-02-21 17:30,2026-02-21 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/21/P2026022100372.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (February 21), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
---------------------------

  Hong Kong has recorded two confirmed CF cases so far this year, all of which were imported cases. Last year, Hong Kong recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

  Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere is currently in the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments (including the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), Kwai Tsing District Office, Lands Department, Drainage Services Department, and Civil Engineering and Development Department) have been continuously conducting comprehensive mosquito control and environmental remediation work along the trails. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local cases, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


  The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

  Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


  The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2026-02-21 17:30,2026-02-21 17:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/21/P2026022100371.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（二月二十一日）下午五時，中心沒有錄得新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案。

最新監測數據
——————

本港今年暫時累計錄得兩宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港去年錄得82宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案中，11宗屬本地個案，其餘全部屬輸入個案。

自二○二五年初至十二月十日，全球超過40個國家／地區呈報了502 264宗基孔肯雅熱病例及186宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。雖然北半球正值冬季，但受氣候變化影響，亞熱帶及部分溫帶地區的氣溫仍然偏高，適合蚊媒滋生，加上基孔肯雅熱在全球多國持續爆發，輸入風險仍然存在，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況，尤其前往東南亞國家。

繼續加強防控
——————

因應去年十一月有多宗基孔肯雅熱本地個案的患者曾到訪青衣自然徑一帶，該處目前暫停開放，直至另行通告。相關政府部門（包括食物環境衞生署（食環署）、葵青民政事務處、地政總署、渠務署及土木工程拓展署）在過去一段時間在該自然徑持續進行全面的防蚊及環境整治工作。自二○二五年十二月十日確診一宗於二○二五年十一月三十日曾經前往青衣自然徑的個案後，至今再沒有錄得本地感染個案。

食環署聯同相關部門自去年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入及本地個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。


食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

Reporter: Could you also tell us in English what is the impact on Hong Kong after Donald Trump signed the 10 per cent global tariff on top of the existing tax?

Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury: If you look at what Hong Kong as it is, one of our advantages is the certainty in terms of how we regulate the market and the overall stability of our overall environment. And this fiasco, I think basically highlights the importance of Hong Kong in this area. We'll continue to see Hong Kong as a very strong and also very safe haven for global investors and global corporates to invest and to station here.

Accident and Emergency Departments of public hospitals operate smoothly during Lunar New Year holidays,2026-02-20 19:10,2026-02-20 19:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000561.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for the Hospital Authority (HA) announced today (February 20) that over the past three days of the Lunar New Year holidays, the number of patients attending the 18 Accident and Emergency Departments (A&Es) under the HA decreased by over 10 per cent compared to the same period last year. This indicates that the public healthcare fees and charges reform has achieved its desired effect, alleviating service pressure on A&Es and enabling them to concentrate resources on patients with urgent medical needs.

The Chairman of the HA Coordinating Committee in A&E, Dr Axel Siu, said, ""During the past three-day public holiday, the number of patients attending A&Es decreased by approximately 11 per cent to 15 per cent compared to the same period last year (see Table). A&Es operations across all hospitals remained normal, allowing patients with urgent medical needs to receive prompt treatment. Less urgent patients also experienced shorter waiting times. This demonstrates that the various measures introduced under the public healthcare fees and charges reform are proving effective, enabling A&Es to perform their emergency care function.""

Dr Siu further explained that in the small hours of today, some A&Es needed to deploy healthcare staff to resuscitate patient cases, coupled with the usual increase in A&E attendances following the extended holidays, which led to longer waiting times for some less urgent patients this morning. Dr Siu emphasised that, despite the increased workload in A&Es, services for critical, emergency and urgent patients were not affected. Additional staff have been deployed to enhance service, ensuring all patients received appropriate treatment. By the afternoon, waiting times for less urgent patients had progressively decreased, with most receiving suitable care within a few hours.

The HA anticipates that public hospital A&E services will remain busy in the coming days after the Lunar New Year holidays. Non-urgent patients are advised to avoid using A&E services and to seek consultation at Family Medicine Clinics, private doctors, or 24-hour outpatient services at private hospitals to reduce pressure on public hospital A&Es.

From January 1 to February 10 this year, a total of 199 406 patients attended the 18 A&Es under the HA, reflecting a significant decrease of nearly 10.9 per cent compared to the same period last year. Among these, 98 988 patients were classified as semi-urgent and non-urgent, a reduction of about 18.6 per cent from the previous year.

During this period, waiting times for all critical and emergency patients fully met the pledge targets, with critical patients receiving immediate treatment and emergency patients being treated within 15 minutes. For patients triaged as urgent cases, the percentage of those being treated within 30 minutes - meeting the service pledge target - increased from 80.1 per cent last year to 86.9 per cent, with the average waiting time reduced from 24 minutes to 20 minutes. The average waiting times for semi-urgent and non-urgent patients also decreased from 136 minutes to 124 minutes.

公立醫院急症室於農曆新年假期運作暢順,2026-02-20 19:10,2026-02-20 19:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202602/20/P2026022000558.htm,"下稿代醫院管理局發出：

醫院管理局（醫管局）發言人今日（二月二十日）表示，過去三日農曆新年公眾假期，醫管局轄下18間急症室的求診人數較去年農曆新年三日假期的求診人數下跌超過一成，顯示公營醫療收費改革已取得預期效果，紓緩急症室的服務壓力，令急症室可集中資源全力照顧有緊急醫療需要的病人。

醫管局急症科統籌委員會主席蕭粵中醫生說︰「過去三日公眾假期，前往急症室求診的病人數目較去年農曆新年同期大約減少11%至15%（見附表）。各醫院急症室運作正常，有緊急醫療需要的病人均可以迅速獲得治療，至於非緊急病人，亦不需要等候太長時間，顯示公營醫療收費改革的各項措施正發揮效用，急症室可真正發揮救急扶危的功能。」

蕭粵中醫生表示，由於今日凌晨時分，部分醫院急症室需調動醫護人員處理搶救個案，加上一般在長假期結束後，都會有較多病人到急症室求診，導致今日早上部分急症室的非緊急病人需要等候較長時間。蕭粵中醫生強調，雖然急症室比較繁忙，但所有危殆、危急及緊急病人的服務均沒有受影響；急症室已調動額外人手加強服務，確保所有病人均獲得合適的治療。到下午時段，急症室的非緊急病人等候時間已陸續回落，大部分病人在等候數小時內已獲得合適的治療。

醫管局預計，隨著農曆新年長假期結束，未來幾日各公立醫院急症室的服務會繼續繁忙，非緊急的病人應避免使用急症室，盡量向家庭醫學門診、私家醫生及私家醫院24小時門診求診，以減輕公立醫院急症室的壓力。

由今年一月一日至二月十日，共有199 406名病人前往醫管局轄下18間急症室就診，較去年同期顯著減少近10.9%。當中98 988名病人分流為次緊急及非緊急，較去年同期減少約18.6%。

在上述期間，危殆及危急病人的救治時間全部達標，即危殆病人獲即時診治，危急病人於15分鐘內獲診治。緊急病人於30分鐘內就診的服務承諾達標比率，由80.1%增加至86.9%，平均等候時間亦由24分鐘縮短至20分鐘。次緊急及非緊急病人的平均等候時間亦由136分鐘減少至124分鐘。
