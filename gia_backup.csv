EPD responds to Ombudsman's direct investigation report,2025-09-12 11:12,2025-09-12 11:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100550.htm,"  The Office of the Ombudsman today (September 12) released a report on its direct investigation into the illegal disposal problem and the ""HoHoSkips"" recycling service for construction waste.

  A spokesperson for the Environmental Protection Department (EPD)said, ""The Department's efforts in combating the illegal disposal of construction waste in recent years have shown significant results. The amount of illegally disposed construction waste cleared by the Government has significantly decreased from the peak of around 9 000 tonnes in 2017 to about 1 000 tonnes between 2022 and 2024 (see Annex), representing a reduction of about 89 per cent. In some previous illegal disposal blackspots, such as the areas around Arran Street in Mong Kok and Wang Wo Tsai Street in Tsuen Wan, the reduction in the amount of illegally disposed construction waste has even exceeded 90 per cent.""

  The Office has recognised the EPD's efforts and effectiveness in combating the illegal disposal of construction waste, as well as its use of smart technology to assist law enforcement. The report suggested a series of measures to further enhance the effectiveness of combating the illegal disposal of construction waste and the ""HoHoSkips"" service.

  The EPD expressed its appreciation for the suggestions and will actively follow up in five directions, namely, reviewing ways to strengthen enforcement against illegal disposal of construction waste; strengthening promotional efforts on proper handling of construction waste; reviewing and enhancing the ""HoHoSkips"" service to increase efficiency, including the expansion of the ""Smart HoHoSkips"" recycling service; optimising the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile application and webpage; and collecting feedback from users to improve the ""HoHoSkips"" service.

  The EPD will continue to regularly review the operational data of the surveillance camera systems and related intelligence, and flexibly adjust the system distribution. It will also continue to deploy law enforcement actions and carry out promotional activities in areas with frequent small-scale renovation works and building maintenance activities, aiming to strengthen deterrence, improve enforcement efficiency and increase prosecution success rates. Moreover, the EPD has already initiated follow-up actions with the respective recycling organisation to implement enhancement measures for the ""HoHoSkips"" service as soon as possible to improve users' experience."

​申訴專員公署公布就非法棄置建築廢物問題及「好好斗」回收服務的主動調查行動報告（附圖）,2025-09-12 11:00,2025-09-12 11:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100734.htm,"下稿代申訴專員公署發出：

申訴專員陳積志今日（九月十二日）宣布完成非法棄置建築廢物問題及「好好斗」回收服務的主動調查行動，並向環境保護署（環保署）提出共15項改善建議。

建築工程和一般裝修工程均會產生不少建築廢物。當局自二○○六年起實施建築廢物處置收費計劃，建築廢物產生者須繳交廢物處置費用，並有責任妥善處置建築廢物。然而，公署留意到，不時有傳媒報道及市民投訴有建築廢物被胡亂棄置在公眾地方，有關違法行為對市民及道路使用者構成不便及安全隱患，亦影響環境衞生。為此，環保署以多管齊下的措施打擊非法棄置建築廢物的問題，並於二○二一年二月推出先導計劃，為市民及中小型裝修工程業界提供有效益的建築廢物收集途徑。市民及業界可透過「好好斗」流動應用程式，預約由回收基金資助的回收機構，妥善處理建築廢物。

公署調查發現，經過環保署多年來努力不懈，包括加裝監察攝錄系統、成立航拍機隊、加強巡查、與其他部門協調及訂立優先處理地點名單以加強監察等，以及現屆政府着力增加打擊力度並於二○二三年將定額罰款金額由1,500元大幅提高至6,000元，政府近年清理的非法棄置建築廢物數量已由二○一七年的9 000公噸大幅下降至二○二二年至二○二四年的每年約1 000公噸，經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物個案數目亦從二○二二年的4 612宗下降38%至二○二四年的2 841宗，反映當局的工作取得相當成效，值得充分肯定。

陳積志表示︰「街道上堆積非法棄置的建築廢物一直是市民關注的問題。我注意到近年有關情況有明顯改善，顯示當局的工作具實質成效，而『好好斗』回收服務計劃的使用率去年亦增加至76%，有更多市民使用該服務處置建築廢物。」

公署主動調查行動中發現，市民就非法棄置建築廢物的相關投訴仍維持每年一千多宗。在投訴個案中，經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物個案由近年的五、六百宗增加至二○二四年接近800宗。此外，公署人員在實地視察及跟隨環保署人員行動時，不難發現街上確有被棄置的建築廢物。資料亦顯示，二○一九年至二○二四年期間，環保署平均每年提出約102宗檢控個案；即使以檢控宗數最多的二○一九年來計算，該年度的檢控率仍只有3.8%。由此可見，環保署就非法棄置建築廢物個案的檢控率極低。公署認為，為進一步打擊非法棄置建築廢物的違法行為，環保署應檢視如何進一步加強執法及蒐證效能。

就「好好斗」回收服務計劃方面，根據環保署資料，二○二三年的服務使用率為62.5%，但同時該年有27.8%的申請被取消是因回收機構在高峰時段的服務供不應求所致，可見當時服務計劃的運作規劃及資源分配未能完全配合服務使用者的實際需要。在公署展開調查後，環保署已就服務的預約申請程序作出改善，讓用戶得悉某時段的預約量是否已滿，並顯示可供預約的時段供其考慮。

回收機構在二○二四年提供的收集服務比二○二三年增加了1 062次，服務使用率亦上升至76%，而在二○二四年因回收機構日程已滿而取消的預約申請的百分比亦下跌至12.1%，顯示「好好斗」回收服務的資源運用情況在最近有顯著改善。從二○二四年增加的收集服務次數及使用率可見，市民對「好好斗」回收服務計劃的需求持續。公署認為，環保署應計劃在新回收機構接手後，適時檢視「好好斗」的服務使用率，並研究如何更善用資源，包括壓縮整體個案的平均處理時間，以進一步提高「好好斗」服務的可服務次數，令公帑得以善用及更多服務使用者受惠。公署亦建議環保署密切留意「好好斗」回收服務的需求變化，若服務需求持續上升，便應考慮增加回收車數量及人手以應付增加的需求。

陳積志表示︰「雖然當局處理非法棄置建築廢物的工作有成效，但環保署的極低檢控率、經環保署核實的非法棄置建築廢物投訴個案不跌反升、『好好斗』回收服務的實際數據等顯示，該署的執管效能及檢控、『好好斗』回收服務的運作及程序等，均有可改善之處。公署期望環保署繼續加強執管、改善『好好斗』回收服務計劃的運作及服務供求情況，務求更有效打擊問題及善用資源。」

公署向環保署提出的主要改善建議包括：


應檢視如何進一步加強執法及蒐證效能，例如利用更多及更高科技協助及優化蒐證工作、靈活調配人手進行針對性巡查和突擊行動等，以提升檢控率及阻嚇力；
應考慮在有較大機會出現違法行為的地方，如區內新落成的屋苑，及進行維修或翻新工程的大廈和店鋪附近，針對性地加強巡查和監察，以收重點打擊之效；
聯同「好好斗」回收服務計劃的回收機構探討如何將高峰時段的服務需求轉移至非高峰時段的其他可行方法；
計劃在新回收機構接手後，適時檢視「好好斗」的服務使用率，並研究如何更善用資源，以提高高峰時段可服務的次數，並減少申請被取消的情況；
應與回收機構研究如何壓縮整體個案的平均處理時間，例如更有效地規劃收集路線，以縮短每宗個案所需的交通時間，從而提高資源的運用效率，得以處理更多的回收申請；並分析以往預約申請的地區分佈，考慮可否在通常較多預約申請的地區提供定點定時的收集服務；
密切留意「好好斗」回收服務計劃的需求變化，若服務需求持續上升，應考慮增加回收車數量及相關人手以應付增加的需求，特別是較易在路邊停泊的小型客貨車的數量；
應考慮主動聯絡「好好斗」服務使用者及業界，或在「好好斗」流動應用程式加入收集使用者意見的功能，收集有用意見以改善服務；
應檢視及改善「好好斗」流動應用程式的「使用者守則」及有關計劃網頁的內容，添加使用者須注意的其他重要事項，包括說明取消預約申請的後果，以減少預約申請被取消的情況，亦有助使用者正確及暢順地使用回收服務；以及
應提醒及監督回收機構盡早就涉及服務變更的資訊於網頁及流動應用程式作出通知，以減低對服務使用者的影響。


公署欣悉環保署接納公署提出的所有改善建議。

"Ombudsman announces results of direct investigation operation into illegal disposal of construction waste and ""HoHoSkips"" recycling service (with photo)",2025-09-12 11:00,2025-09-12 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100737.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Office of The Ombudsman:

The Ombudsman, Mr Jack Chan, today (September 12) announced the completion of a direct investigation operation into the illegal disposal of construction waste and the ""HoHoSkips"" recycling service, with 15 improvement recommendations made to the Environmental Protection Department (EPD).

Construction works and general renovation works inevitably generate a considerable amount of construction waste. Under the Construction Waste Disposal Charging Scheme implemented since 2006, construction waste producers are required to pay for waste disposal and have a duty to dispose of waste properly. Nevertheless, there have been media reports and public complaints from time to time about illegal disposal of construction waste in public places. Such illegal activities not only cause inconvenience and safety hazards for the public and road users but also affect environmental hygiene. In this connection, the EPD has adopted multipronged measures against illegal disposal of construction waste. In February 2021, it also launched a pilot scheme to provide the public and small-to-medium renovators with an effective way for collection of construction waste. Through the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile application, members of the public and the trade can book the service of the recycler subsidised by the Recycling Fund for proper disposal of construction waste.

The Office's investigation revealed that the EPD has spared no effort over the years which included the installation of surveillance camera systems, establishment of a drone fleet, enhanced patrolling, collaboration with other departments, and compilation of a list of priority sites for reinforced surveillance. Coupled with the current-term Government's more stringent enforcement and hiking the fixed penalty from $1,500 to $6,000 in 2023, the quantity of illegally disposed construction waste cleared by the Government dropped substantially from 9 000 tonnes in 2017 to around 1 000 tonnes per year between 2022 and 2024. The number of illegal disposal cases confirmed by the EPD fell by 38 per cent, from 4 612 cases in 2022 to 2 841 cases in 2024. These figures reflect the substantive results of the enforcement efforts of the Administration, which are certainly commendable.

Mr Chan said, ""The illegal disposal of construction waste on the roadside has been a problem widely concerned by the public. I notice the marked improvement in recent years, which indicates that the authorities' efforts are effective. The usage rate of the 'HoHoSkips' scheme increased to 76 per cent last year, meaning more people have used the service to dispose of construction waste.""

The Office's direct investigation operation revealed that public complaints about illegal disposal of construction waste stand at over 1 000 cases annually. Among the complaints, the number of illegal disposal cases confirmed by the EPD increased to nearly 800 in 2024 from the level of 500 to 600 a few years ago. Furthermore, during the Office's site inspections and shadowing of the EPD's operations, it was not uncommon to find construction waste dumped on streets. Statistics also show that between 2019 and 2024, the EPD instigated an average of around 102 prosecution cases annually. Even in 2019, the year with the highest number of prosecution cases, the prosecution rate was only 3.8 per cent, indicating that the EPD's prosecution rate against illegal disposal of construction waste is extremely low. The Office urges the EPD to review how to further strengthen its enforcement and evidence-gathering effectiveness to improve deterrence against illegal disposal of construction waste.

The EPD's data shows that the usage rate of ""HoHoSkips"" service was 62.5 per cent in 2023, but 27.8 per cent of the cancelled bookings in the same year were due to insufficient capacity of the recycler to meet the demand at peak times, reflecting a mismatch between the operational planning and resource allocation under the scheme and the actual needs of users at that time. Following the launch of this investigation, the EPD has improved the booking process by allowing users to view whether a time slot has been fully booked and showing alternative available slots for their consideration.

In 2024, the recycler made 1 062 more collections than in 2023, raising the service usage rate to 76 per cent. The percentage of cancellations due to overbooking also dropped to 12.1 per cent in 2024, indicating a significant improvement in the usage of ""HoHoSkips"" resources recently. The increase in the number of collections and usage rate in 2024 shows that public demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service remains strong. The Office recommends that the EPD conduct timely review of the usage rate after the takeover of ""HoHoSkips"" service by a new recycler, and explore ways of better resource allocation, including shortening the average handling time per case to increase available service under the scheme. This will ensure better use of public funds for the benefit of more users. The Office also recommends that the EPD closely monitor changes in the demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service. If demand continues to rise, the EPD should consider increasing the number of collection vehicles and manpower to meet the growing demand.

Mr Chan said, ""Despite the positive results achieved by the authorities against illegal disposal of construction waste, there is still room for improvement in the EPD's enforcement effectiveness and prosecution, as well as the operation and procedures of the 'HoHoSkips' service, in view of the extremely low rate of prosecution, increase rather than decrease in the number of illegal disposal complaints confirmed by the EPD, and the actual statistics of the 'HoHoSkips' service. We urge the EPD to continue stepping up enforcement and enhance the operation of the 'HoHoSkips' scheme and the supply and demand for its service, thereby further combating illegal disposal of construction waste and optimising the use of resources.""

The Office's major recommendations for improvement to the EPD include:


explore how to further strengthen its enforcement and evidence-gathering effectiveness, such as by making greater use of more advanced technologies to assist and optimise evidence collection, and flexibly deploying staff for targeted inspections and blitz operations, so as to improve prosecution rate and deterrence;
consider reinforcing patrols and surveillance in areas where offences are more likely to occur (such as in the vicinity of newly completed housing estates, and buildings and shops with renovation or repair works in progress) to achieve more targeted enforcement;
work with the recycler of the ""HoHoSkips"" scheme to explore feasible ways of shifting service demand from peak to off-peak times;
conduct timely review of the usage rate after the takeover of ""HoHoSkips"" service by a new recycler, and explore ways of better resource allocation to increase available service at peak times and minimise cancellations;
work with the recycler to shorten the average handling time per case (such as shortening the travel time per case by better route planning), so as to optimise the use of resources and accommodate more bookings; analyse the geographic distribution of past bookings, and consider offering collection service at fixed times and locations in districts with high demand;
closely monitor changes in the demand for the ""HoHoSkips"" service; if demand continues to rise, consider increasing the number of collection vehicles and manpower to meet the growing demand, particularly the number of light goods vehicles that are easier to park by the roadside;
consider engaging with ""HoHoSkips"" users and the trade, or incorporate a feedback feature into the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile app to gather useful input for service improvement;
review and improve the content of both the user guidelines on the ""HoHoSkips"" mobile app and its website, adding important information for the attention of users (including the consequences of cancelling a booking) to minimise cancellations, as well as to ensure correct and smooth use of the recycling service; and
remind and supervise the recycler to promptly announce any service-related changes via both website and mobile app to minimise disruption to users.


The Office is pleased to note that the EPD has accepted all of the improvement recommendations.

Please broadcast the following as soon as possible:

The Hong Kong Observatory has issued the Very Hot Weather Warning.

To prevent heat stroke, avoid prolonged activities outdoors.

Drink plenty of water, and avoid beverages containing caffeine or alcohol.

If you feel sick, consult a doctor right away."
DH reminds public to take precautions against heat-related illnesses during very hot weather,2025-09-12 06:45,2025-09-12 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/12/P2025091100943.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (September 12) reminded members of the public to take appropriate precautions against heat-related illnesses, such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke during very hot weather.

In a high-temperature environment, excessive sweating and difficulty in heat dissipation can cause stress to the body. Members of the public should take the following precautions:

Hydrate in a timely manner to prevent dehydration;
Wear light-coloured, loose-fitting and breathable clothing to minimise heat absorption and facilitate perspiration and heat dissipation;
Keep the room well ventilated, e.g. by opening windows;
Avoid strenuous exercise and prolonged activities such as hiking or trekking;
Arrange outdoor activities in the morning or the late afternoon, if possible, and bring enough water; and
Avoid beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee and tea, as well as alcoholic beverages, which may speed up water loss through the urinary system.


In addition, infants and children, the elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses such as heart disease or high blood pressure, outdoor/manual workers, and overweight people are more susceptible to heat stroke. These groups should pay special attention to the following:


Avoid taking infants and young children outside when the temperature is high. If they must go outside, adults should ensure they stay in places with moderate temperatures and good ventilation or air-conditioning. Infants and young children should never be left unattended in a confined space such as a vehicle;
The elderly, pregnant women, individuals with chronic illnesses or overweight people should pay close attention to their health. They should seek help as soon as possible if they experience any abnormalities in health indicators such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc or if there are fluctuations in their health conditions. Avoid going out when the temperature is high. Make sure there is good ventilation, or turn on a fan or air-conditioner to keep an appropriate temperature indoors. High temperatures can also worsen the condition of people with chronic illnesses (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). Therefore, they should have an ample supply of their usual medication and keep in contact with family members, neighbours and the community. People should seek immediate help if they feel unwell.
Outdoor/manual workers are advised to reschedule work to cooler hours as far as feasible. If working in a hot environment is unavoidable, provide shade where practicable and use ventilation and heat dissipation equipment. Once work has begun, gradually adjust the pace of work and take breaks in the shade to regain strength.


â""Heat stroke is one of the most common health risks in hot weather. Over the past five years, there have been over 200 hospital admissions due to heat stroke each year in Hong Kong, with two to five fatal cases occurring mainly during the summer months from May to September. Vulnerable groups are more susceptible to heat stroke. Symptoms include dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion. In severe cases, patients may suffer from convulsions or become unconscious, which can be life-threatening if they are not cooled down and resuscitated in a timely manner,"" a spokesman for the CHP said.

Members of the public are also advised to pay attention to the latest weather, as well as the real-time and forecasted ultraviolet (UV) index released by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). When the UV index is high (6 or above):


Minimise direct sunlight exposure to the skin and the eyes;
Apply broad-spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 or higher when participating in outdoor activities. Reapply sunscreen every two hours if staying outdoors for long periods of time, or after swimming, sweating or toweling off;
While using DEET-containing insect repellents for personal protection against mosquito-borne diseases, apply sunscreen before insect repellent;
Seek shade;
Wear UV-blocking sunglasses;
Wear loose-fitting clothing with long-sleeves; and
Wear a wide-brimmed hat or use an umbrella.


âIf symptoms develop, such as dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath or confusion, rest and seek help immediately, and seek medical advice as soon as possible.

âThe public may obtain more information from the DH's Health Education Infoline (2833 0111), heat strokepage andUV radiation page; the HKO's Dial-a-Weather (1878 200),latestweather report and forecast, UV Indexand weather information for hiking and mountaineering; and press releases of the Labour Departmenton precautions against heat stroke for outdoor workers and their employers when the Heat Stress at Work Warning is in force."

葉劉淑儀致辭時憶述，28年前她出任入境處處長期間，正值香港回歸祖國。儘管面臨種種未知之數及挑戰，入境處同事依然克盡己任，發揮專業精神，迎難而上，最終完成多項工作，確保交接順利。她表示，入境處團隊已由當年約5000人擴展至現時近9000人，是香港特別行政區（特區）主要執法隊伍之一。此外，入境處的工作也日趨多元化，除了在市民人生不同階段為他們提供服務外，更積極推行各類吸引人才的入境計劃，並為在境外遇事的香港居民提供協助等。她相信入境處定能繼續與時並進，精益求精，善用創新科技，進一步提升工作效率及服務水平，以更好配合社會的發展及市民的需要。

她又指出，入境處作為香港的「第一道防線」，在維護國家安全及社會穩定方面肩負重任。入境處人員應踐行總體國家安全觀，支持中央人民政府駐香港特區維護國家安全公署的工作，亦應主動識別可疑人物，防範危害國家安全的風險。

  During the parade, the Immigration Band played multiple pieces of Chinese military band music, patriotic songs and pop classics, whereas the Guard of Honour assembled to form the logo of the Skytrax Award to celebrate the Immigration Department (ImmD)'s winning of the 2025 Skytrax Award for the Best Airport Immigration Service, demonstrating the ImmD's determination to become the foremost immigration service in the world in effectiveness and efficiency.

  In her speech, Mrs Ip recalled that she had taken up the post of Director of Immigration 28 years ago amidst Hong Kong's return to the motherland. In the face of unknowns and obstacles, staff of the ImmD remained committed to their duties and rose to the challenges with professionalism, leading to the completion of numerous tasks and eventually a smooth transition. She noted that the ImmD has grown from a team of around 5000 back then to be close to 9000 today, making it one of the key law enforcement agencies in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Furthermore, the work of the ImmD has become increasingly diverse. In addition to providing services to members of the public at different stages of life, the ImmD has also been actively implementing various admission schemes to attract talent and providing assistance to Hong Kong residents in distress outside Hong Kong, among others. She said she believes that the ImmD would continue to keep pace with the times and strive for excellence, while leveraging innovative technologies to further enhance its work efficiency and service standards, so as to better cater for the development of society and the needs of the public.

  She also remarked that, as Hong Kong's ""first line of defence"", the ImmD has an important role to play in safeguarding national security and social stability. Immigration officers should follow through a holistic approach to national security and support the work of the Office for Safeguarding National Security of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR. They should also proactively identify suspicious individuals and avert risks endangering national security.

  Finally, Mrs Ip encouraged the graduates to always uphold the ImmD's values of ""Patriotism and Perseverance"" as well as ""Improvement and Illumination"", and be mindful of the constitutional duty embodied in the epaulettes on their uniforms. She was confident that the graduates would contribute to the country and society in the days to come, creating a bright future for both themselves and their families."

大家好！今晚很榮幸出席香港宗教界慶祝國慶籌備委員會舉辦的香港宗教界慶祝中華人民共和國成立七十六周年大會，與各方友好一同分享國慶的喜悅。

每年十月一日的中華人民共和國國慶日，對我們中國人而言都意義深遠。七十六年來，全國各族人民同心同德、艱苦奮鬥，讓國家的經濟和國力不斷提升，取得令世界刮目相看的偉大成就。

今年也是抗戰勝利80周年，國慶日的意義更為重大。香港六宗教領袖座談會上個月也舉辦了紀念會，祈願世界和平、尊重國家主權及民族平等，並呼籲各界以和平溝通、平等對話的方式解決分歧。從80年前迎來勝利後的百廢待興，到今天的國富民強、國泰民安，更令我們珍惜和平，明白發展和國家安全互為依存。上星期三，我極其榮幸獲得邀請在天安門廣場參加了勝利80周年大會的隆重儀式，現場聽取習近平主席發表重要講話和觀看大閱兵。習主席表示：「歷史警示我們，人類命運休戚與共，各個國家、各個民族只有平等相待、和睦相處、守望相助，才能維護共同安全，消弭戰爭根源，不讓歷史悲劇重演﹗」主席總結說：「中華民族偉大復興勢不可擋﹗人類和平與發展的崇高事業必將勝利﹗」如今，我國欣欣向榮，在經濟、科技、基建、文化和體育等多個領域取得舉世矚目的成就，已是全球第二大經濟體、第一大工業國、第一大貨物貿易國和第一大外匯儲備國。國家必定越來越強盛，香港的未來也必定越來越璀璨。

香港宗教界一直和衷共濟。六宗教團體向來致力促進彼此的交流合作，團結一心發揮力量。早在一九七八年，香港六宗教領袖座談會成立，自此一直關心各項社會、民生和宗教議題，亦舉辦不同跨宗教活動，加深彼此認識，共建和諧社會。宗教團體除了弘揚教義之外，也興辦學校、醫院及提供種種福利服務，惠澤社群，實在令人敬佩。

今日我們能在此共賀國慶，我要感謝主辦單位香港宗教界慶祝國慶籌備委員會，匯聚了香港佛教聯合會、天主教香港教區、孔教學院、中華回教博愛社、香港基督教協進會，以及香港道教聯合會的代表，合力籌辦這場國慶大會，讓我們深切體會到香港宗教界的愛國情懷。

展望未來，我深信香港宗教界定會一如以往，與特區政府攜手構建關懷仁愛的社會，為香港的繁榮穩定貢獻更大力量。

最後，我祝今年國慶大會圓滿成功，各團體會務蒸蒸日上，在座各位在濃厚的愛國氛圍中歡度國慶，事事順利、身體健康。多謝大家。"

At the signing ceremony, Ms Chiang acknowledged that the enduring partnership between Customs and CityU encompasses various collaborative initiatives in both academic programmes and specialised training for the Customs Canine Force (CCF). This MOU signing not only marks a significant milestone in the partnership but also launches the Smart Collar Research Project, which aims to study, analyse, as well as optimise the utilisation of data collected from detector dogs including heart rates, respiratory rates and temperatures for enhanced enforcement capabilities and the welfare standards of detector dogs.

CityU, as Hong Kong's pioneer and sole provider of the Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine programme, has been offering invaluable support to Customs through comprehensive breeding training programmes, veterinary nursing expertise, and puppy development courses.

Looking ahead, Customs is dedicated to pursuing innovative collaborations with CityU to enhance the effectiveness of its canine operations. By leveraging academic expertise, Customs aims to implement advanced training techniques and technology, ultimately strengthening the impact of the CCF in safeguarding national security and Hong Kong's boundary.

The CCF has been making significant contributions to Hong Kong since its establishment in 1975. It currently maintains 70 detector dog teams, specialising in narcotics, explosives, currency, firearms, and tobacco detection, supported by more than 100 dedicated officers. To ensure a sustainable supply of high-calibre working dogs, Customs initiated its breeding programme in 2020. The programme has successfully produced 36 puppies to date."
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-09-11 19:35,2025-09-11 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100758.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (September 11), twonew imported cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded, involving the same family.

Latest case information

 The two cases involve a 79-year-old female and a 75-year-old male, both living in Sha Tin District. They visited Panyu District in Guangzhou from August 30 to September 6. On September 9, they developed a fever, headache and joint pain. The female patient also developed a rash. They attended General Out-patient Clinics yesterday (September 10) and weresubsequently transferred to Prince of Wales Hospital. They were admitted for treatment in a mosquito-free environment and are now in stable condition. Their blood samples tested positive for the CF virus upon laboratory testing.

They have one household contact, who did not travel to Guangzhou with them. This household contact is currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

 Since the two patients stayed in Guangzhou during their incubation periods, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it has reported the cases to the health authority of Guangdong Province.

So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 16 confirmed CF cases. All are imported cases. From 2016 to 2019, Hong Kong recorded between one and 11 imported cases annually.

  From January to July this year, more than 240 000 cases were recorded in 16 countries/regions worldwide, including about 90 deaths. In Asia, India and Indonesia recorded more than 32 000 and 17 000 cases respectively in 2025. Other regions that have recorded CF cases include the Mainland, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, etc. Although the situation in Guangdong Province has been under control since late August, with only sporadic new cases reported each day, CF outbreaks continue in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) continues to conduct vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations, and intensify mosquito prevention and control measures at the residences of recently confirmed patients, as well as at locations visited after the onset of symptoms. These measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging inscrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

â
The CHP urged schools to follow the FEHD's anti-mosquito guidelines to strengthen efforts to clear stagnant water on school premises and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. It is also imperative to remind staff members and students to consistently implement mosquito prevention and personal protective measures to guard against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases within school premises.

âAdditionally, the CHP's Port Health Division continues to step up inspections at boundary control points and to remind cross-boundary public transport operators and other relevant parties to ensure good environmental hygiene and effective implementation of anti-mosquito measures. Furthermore, staff members of the Port Health Division distribute leaflets to travellers, conduct temperature screenings for inbound travellers, conduct health assessments for travellers with fever or related symptoms and refer them to hospitals for follow-ups when necessary.

Proper use of DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients can prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


ââThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as soft drink cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and estate management bodies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

立法會：醫務衞生局局長在全體委員會審議階段就《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》各項條文及修正案合併辯論發言（只有中文）,2025-09-11 19:34,2025-09-11 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100735.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十一日）在立法會會議全體委員會審議階段就《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）各項條文及修正案合併辯論的發言：

主席：

我先談談7.8%吸煙率目標的問題，雖然這不是一個《條例草案》答辯環節，但對政府總體政策，特別是加味煙的控制是非常重要的，我們特别留意到年輕人吸食加味煙的問題很嚴重。吸煙的年輕人中，約70%吸第一口煙便是加味煙。如我們不控制加味煙，這數字會上升。7.8%這個數字，是二○一八年以二○一○年的數字作為基數，減低30%來釐訂的。雖然這是於二○一八年釐訂，而不是現屆政府釐訂，但我們都以此作為目標。這目標可比喻作考試訂立滿分為100分，但我們考試從來不會因為未能考獲100分便鬆懈。我相信邵家輝議員和田北辰議員都不會容許子女因為未必能考獲100分，而不讓他們考試。我會盡力，每一分我們都會爭取，目標仍然是向着7.8%這個方向。正如我剛才說，控煙永遠在路上。我們會繼續努力，就算吸煙率達到7.8%，我們仍然可以再降低一些。

就李鎮強議員和邵家輝議員提出的修正案，從政策原則和實際操作角度來看，政府必須堅決反對有關動議，我現在會作詳細回應交代相關理據。

（一）取消或放寬加味煙禁令

首先，李鎮強議員動議在《條例草案》中刪去加味煙禁令相關的條文，與政府整體控煙政策特別是保護下一代、減低煙草產品吸引力的目標背道而馳，漠視加味煙為刺喉有害的煙霧作掩飾，成為糖衣毒藥，增加非吸煙人士，特別是年輕人染上煙癮的機會。調查顯示，越年輕的人士吸食加味煙的比率越高，正如我剛才所說，首次吸煙的年輕人吸食加味煙的比率達到約70%。提出和支持相關議員修正案等同助長煙草商繼續以加味煙吸引年輕人吸第一口煙，向青年人推銷糖衣毒藥，向社會輸出一個極度錯誤的訊息，故此不應予以採納。

反之，禁止加味煙其實是世界衞生組織《煙草控制框架公約》實施準則建議各國推行的措施，是抗衡煙草商以加味劑掩飾煙草產品毒性意圖的重要手段。全球約50個國家和地區，包括歐盟（歐洲聯盟）27個成員國、加拿大和英國已全面禁止售賣加味煙。禁止加味傳統吸煙產品並非香港獨有，反而是讓香港跟上國際控煙政策的舉措。

就邵家輝議員動議在加味煙禁令下原則性豁免任何「通常使用或必需使用的物質」，以及豁免並非為注入味道或香氣而加入的物質等，政府在法案委員會中已一再就禁令的規管框架及其適用範圍進行解說。《條例草案》建議的加味煙禁令以國際最佳實踐典範，即加拿大的監管框架為藍本。《條例草案》訂出「禁止添加劑」的明確標準，首要目標是預防下一代因容易入口、口味多變的加味煙染上煙癮和鼓勵現有煙民戒煙。《條例草案》會以清單形式明文列出禁止和豁免物質，內容和草擬方式均與加拿大相關法規一致。另外，政府亦已一再重申，《條例草案》「指明添加劑」顧名思義並不包括自然存在於煙葉內的成分，執法部門可以透過科學方法區分其是屬於煙草產品中自然存在的物質，或是屬於經人工添加的添加劑，因此我們強調不用修改已能達到議員修正案的效果。

另外，禁令亦已豁免在加拿大、澳洲也有明文列出、屬煙草產品製造過程中必要的物質清單，而過程中我們亦參考了法案委員會的意見作出修訂，豁免的物質及草擬方式，均與加拿大的條文一致，包括以明文方式豁免製造傳統吸煙產品必需的礦物質營養；以及蔬菜萃取物中的澱粉。修訂條文已充分顧及到煙草產品製造的需要，故此邵家輝議員提出的修正案亦無必要。事實上，《條例草案》以國際最佳實踐典範加拿大為藍本。加拿大二○○九年成功實施禁令，超過15年來一樣有合規格的原味煙合法銷售。我們的禁令甚至可以形容為較寬鬆一些，例如薄荷煙會下一階段才禁止，故此我不太同意田北辰議員提出的意見，希望控煙力度可更進取；香港推行時會有過渡安排，及後除非添加了調味劑，傳統煙仍可合法銷售，所謂「禁止加味煙導致全港煙草產品下架」的指控毫無事實依據。

此外，如果將參考加拿大行之有效而且清晰的明文逐項列舉豁免物質草擬方式，修訂為邵家輝議員提出的原則性豁免，模糊定義例如「通常使用的物質」，這是邵家輝議員使用的詞語，到底甚麼是大家「通常使用的物質」？「通常」是一日內、一年內、十年內使用才是「通常」？80%或90%使用量才是「通常」？以及「注入味道或香氣的目的而加入傳統煙的添加劑」。這些如此模糊的定義將為執行禁令帶來極大不確定性，所謂「通常使用的物質」的豁免只會被濫用，而執法部門亦難以判斷煙商添加每項成分的主觀意圖到底是否為了香味而加入物質，或會引發無止境豁免定義的法律訴訟，他們的根本目的是要令禁令難以落實。

（二）以「先審議、後訂立」方式審議附屬法例

另一方面，邵家輝議員動議以「先審議、後訂立」（positive vetting）而非《條例草案》載明的「先訂立、後審議」（negative vetting）方式審議《條例草案》賦權制定的所有附屬法例，包括訂立有關完稅煙標籤制度的生效日期公告；以及制定有關實施全煙害警示包裝規定和證明書制度的規例。

政府不同意邵家輝議員提出的修正案變更有關附屬法例審議方式的主要原因包括：

（1）「先訂立、後審議」是立法會審議附屬法例的常用程序，立法會有既定機制和程序審議政府透過「先訂立、後審議」形式提交的相關附屬法例，讓議員履行監察政府、審議法案的職能，絕對不會削弱議會審議權力；

（2）現行《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章）下的規例和命令等附屬法例的制定一向都是訂明以「先訂立、後審議」（negative vetting）的方式推行。《條例草案》為實施全煙害警示包裝的規定和推行禁止加味傳統吸煙產品禁令已經提供了法律框架，包括各項擬議罪行範圍及其最高刑罰等，賦權政府訂立相關附屬法例。事實上，全煙害警示包裝和證明書制度相關的附屬法例旨在體現主體法例的政策原則，範疇不會超過主體法例，附屬法例均主要牽涉執行細則和有關的行政程序。舉例而言，過往規定煙包健康忠告佔包裝的比例和更換健康忠告圖像亦是以「先訂立、後審議」的方式提交立法會審議，性質上與實施全煙害警示包裝規定類同，因此我們認為沿用「先訂立、後審議」的方式是更為合適和合理的做法；

（3）「控煙十招」各項措施的推行時間環環緊扣，包括計劃有序地先推行完稅煙標籤制度、全煙害警示包裝和加味煙禁令，而實施全煙害警示包裝的規定暫計劃於二○二七年第二季與完稅標籤制度同步實施。透過「先訂立、後審議」（negative vetting）方式可讓業界更掌握措施的實際推行時間，為業界生產運作帶來更大確定性。反之，如動議更改第371章一向行之有效的制定附屬法例模式，將會改變條例原有的設計之餘，業界可能因「先審議、後訂立」（positive vetting）難以預計，更要面對冗長的審議過程增加不少不確定性。再者，法案委員會整體上同意各項措施的落實時間表，邵家輝議員提出以「先審議後訂立」審議生效日期公告不符合一貫慣例，實質上亦沒有必要；

（4）政府會在籌備推行上述措施及草擬附屬法例的過程中綜合考慮先導計劃和試行安排的經驗、執法準備、過渡期安排、公眾宣傳進度等操作因素，我希望一再重申，我們會適時就落實措施的安排徵詢相關立法會事務委員會的意見，當中會適當地將議員的意見納入向立法會提交的附屬法例，確保各項控煙措施正式生效前會有足夠長的過渡期讓公眾和業界適應，過程亦絕不會繞過立法會。

有議員提及在程序處理方面、有關環境及生態局的一個例子，我們明確指出，環境及生態局的例子不能直接與是次控煙法例修訂比較：

首先，環境及生態局早於二○二三年十一月向環境事務委員會諮詢時，已明確表示會採用「先審議、後訂立」（positive vetting）程序制訂附屬法例；以及
第二，生產者責任計劃對社會影響面更為廣闊，牽涉不同行業和產品，例如塑膠飲料容器及紙包飲品盒、涉及眾多持份者，包括製造商、進口商、批發商、零售商和消費者共同分擔回收、循環再造、處理和棄置廢棄產品的責任，以及回收設備和數目等議題。反之而言，全煙害警示包裝和證明書制度的附屬法例只是單一類別產品，即煙草產品的技術執行細則和有關的行政程序，亦只牽涉製造商和進口商。


事實上，政府在法案委員會審議過程已全面考慮和吸納議員的意見，我們提出的各項修正案旨在進一步完善《條例草案》，包括理順條文和措施的生效安排，充分體現政府和議員之間的良性互動。

主席，新一階段控煙措施其中一個重點是「禁宣傳、減引誘」，而推行加味煙禁令和實施全煙害警示包裝正正是保護下一代、減低煙草產品吸引力的重要舉措。一個負責任的政府應該迎難而上，全方位杜絕煙草為社會帶來的禍害，因此控煙工作必須堅持到底，在守護下一代健康方面更加沒有妥協的餘地。如《條例草案》今天獲立法會通過，我們定必確保各項措施落實到位，並同時在學校、社區加強宣傳教育工作。我懇請各位議員支持政府的修正案，並反對李鎮強議員和邵家輝議員提出的所有修正案。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
Speech by Acting SJ at Reception of 215th Anniversary of Declaration of Independence of Mexico (English only) (with photos),2025-09-11 19:33,2025-09-11 19:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100755.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Acting Secretary for Justice, Dr Cheung Kwok-kwan, at the Reception of 215th Anniversary of the Declaration of Independence of Mexico today (September 11):

Ambassador Macedo (Consul General of Mexico in Hong Kong, Mr Pablo Macedo Riba), Deputy Commissioner Pan (Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Mr Pan Yundong) , ladies and gentlemen,

  Good evening.

  I am delighted to be here with you tonight to celebrate the 215th anniversary of Mexico's independence.

  This historic national day is flush with music and dancing, fireworks, food, parades and family gatherings throughout Mexico. And well beyond.

  It is also a gratifying opportunity to acknowledge the promising ties between our two economies and peoples. Our bilateral merchandise trade last year reached US$5.7 billion, up nearly 13 per cent over 2023, with annual growth a solid 5.4 per cent between 2020 and 2024. Not surprisingly, Mexico last year was Hong Kong's largest trading partner in Latin America.

  And I'm confident that opportunities between us will continue to expand. In January, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum unveiled ""Plan Mexico"", a long-term strategy to boost the country's economic growth and global competitiveness. It includes emphasising scientific and technological innovation.

  Innovation and technology (I&T) is a Hong Kong Government policy priority. We've got world-class academic and research excellence. As one of the world's leading financial centres, we are blessed with liquidity, along with angel investors, venture capital and private equity funds to support innovative companies.

   Given our strengths as a super connector, Hong Kong is a natural testing ground for new technologies looking for markets in China and throughout the Asian region.

  It also helps, that we are fast integrating with our sister cities in the Greater Bay Area, and its commitment to becoming one of the world's leading I&T centres. The results are clear and compelling.

  The Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou innovation cluster topped the world, for the first time, in the World Intellectual Property Organization's 2025 Global Innovation Index, released this month. And we're just getting going.

  I invite Mexican I&T companies, start-ups and entrepreneurs to collaborate with Hong Kong in shaping the future.

  I look forward, too, to the signing of an agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters with Mexico. It can only create more rewarding opportunities for co-operation.

  We've been blessed with creative collaboration this year, with the Mexican tenor Andrés Moreno García featured in a recent production of The Magic Flute.

  And I know there will be plenty of Mexican creativity on show at ""The Latin Kaleidoscope - Celebrating Latin America in Hong Kong"", later this month at the Hong Kong Observation Wheel and AIA Vitality Park.

  For now, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in a toast on your proud national day: to the people of Mexico. Cheers."
立法會：醫務衞生局局長在全體委員會審議階段就《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》動議修正案發言（只有中文）,2025-09-11 19:32,2025-09-11 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100721.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十一日）在立法會全體委員會審議階段就《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》動議修正案的發言︰

主席：

我現在提出政府的修正案，修訂《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）。修正案內容已載於先前由立法會秘書處發送予各議員的文件內。修正案主要是因應法案委員會委員的意見而提出。有關修訂大致可歸納為五類，我現作扼要說明。

（一）生效安排

正如我剛才二讀發言時所指，新一階段控煙措施的其中一個重點是防止年青一代吸煙。因應法案委員會內陳凱欣議員的意見，我們建議將有關禁止向18歲以下人士提供另類吸煙產品（另類煙）和傳統吸煙產品的條文的生效日期提前至修訂條例刊憲當日。與之相關的定額罰款條文，亦會相應提早至修訂條例刊憲當日起生效。

此外，感謝簡慧敏議員的意見，我們建議訂明《條例草案》有關賦權醫務衞生局局長制定附屬法例以訂明傳統吸煙產品包裝須符合規定和制定加味煙禁令下的合規證明書制度於修訂條例刊憲當日起生效，從而理順整個執法和立法安排。基於相同考慮，有關賦權衞生署署長透過公告指明診所或健康中心的條文和相關釋義亦建議於修訂條例刊憲當日起生效。以上修訂旨在先賦權制定有關規定和公告，而規定和公告的最終訂立仍需分別另外按既定程序通過和處理。

（二）禁止管有另類煙
 
「指明另類吸煙產品」的定義現時載於《條例草案》的主體條例，法案委員會委員林哲玄議員建議修改相關草擬方式。政府的立法原意是在施行禁止管有另類煙用物質，即所謂「煙彈」的禁令後繼續監察另類煙的使用情況，並會視乎需要考慮進一步規管措施，包括把禁令的涵蓋範圍擴展至所有地方，以及禁止管有另類煙裝置，即俗稱「煙機」。因應林議員的意見，我們建議修訂條文做到下一階段可以將禁令延伸到另類煙裝置，而有關延伸可以在下一階段透過生效日期公告實施，而不用修改主體法例。

此外，為提高執法效能，我們經與相關執法部門討論後，建議為控煙酒督察新增逮捕權力。因應法案委員會的意見，我們建議於《吸煙（公眾衞生）條例》（第371章）及《進出口條例》（第60章）加入新訂的條文，進一步賦予控煙酒督察搜查和使用按理屬必需武力的權力以進行搜查或逮捕，強化控煙酒辦（衞生署控煙酒辦公室）就另類煙禁令的執法效能。

（三）擴大法定禁煙區

除了啟德主場館外，我們建議在「體育場」的定義下加入「啟德青年運動場」，使有關場地的禁煙安排在第371章下與「啟德主場館」一致。

（四）實施禁止加味傳統吸煙產品的禁令
 
政府建議的加味煙禁令以國際最佳實踐典範即加拿大的監管框架為藍本，禁止售賣含有「指明添加劑」的傳統吸煙產品。政府已在法案委員會重申，「指明添加劑」顧名思義並不包括自然存在於煙葉內的成分，禁令亦已豁免在加拿大、澳洲也有明文列出的同一份在煙草產品製造過程中必要的物質清單。因應法案委員會會議上的討論和特別是參考了邵家輝議員和江玉歡議員提出的意見，為提供更清晰的規管框架，我們建議修訂相關附表，使其表述方式與加拿大相關法規一致，包括不以使用目的把「指明添加劑」分類的草擬方法，而是以清單形式列出豁免物質，並考慮到議員的意見，以明文方式述明「指明添加劑」不包括（a）製造傳統吸煙產品必需的礦物質營養；以及（b）蔬菜萃取物中的澱粉。另外，有關「被豁除物質」的列表亦會加入兩項與薄荷味相關的物質，以便在首階段先推行非薄荷加味煙禁令，令條文上更易於操作。

執法方面的安排，為加強執法成效，我們建議在《條例草案》加入新訂的條文，賦權控煙酒督察可為實施加味煙禁令的目的，在任何合理時間進入用作儲存傳統吸煙產品的地方或有該等產品被要約出售的地方，抽取傳統吸煙產品樣本的權力。

為更清晰體現禁令下有關豁免出口及轉口的政策原意和條文的完整性，除了為含有指明添加劑的傳統吸煙產品，以及顯示為含有加味劑的傳統吸煙產品提供有關豁免，我們建議加入新訂的條文，訂明如任何事情是就任何設計在傳統吸煙產品中注入加味劑的產品而作出的，而該產品是由該產品的製造商或入口商持有以供輸出香港的，則該些產品的銷售禁令等規定亦不適用。

（五）延長健康忠告圖像訂明新式樣的過渡期

因應法案委員會的意見特別是邵家輝議員轉達業界的關注，我們建議將《條例草案》有關煙草產品封包或零售盛器上健康忠告圖像訂明新式樣的過渡期，由六個月延長至九個月，讓業界有充足的時間配合及遵守相關規定。

除上述五個範疇，修正案亦涵蓋法案委員會曾討論和考慮的技術性和文本上的修訂，以確保條文表達清晰和前後一致。

法案委員會對上述修正案並無異議，我在此懇請各位議員支持及通過我所動議的修正案。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"
立法會：醫務衞生局局長就恢復二讀辯論《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》發言（只有中文）,2025-09-11 19:30,2025-09-11 19:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100720.htm,"以下是醫務衞生局局長盧寵茂教授今日（九月十一日）在立法會會議上就恢復二讀辯論《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》的發言：

主席：

很感謝剛才二讀辯論過程中，多位議員先後發言支持《2025年控煙法例（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》），以推行新一階段控煙措施。

《條例草案》得以今日恢復二讀，是行政立法機關良性互動的體現。由去年六月政府提出「控煙十招」並計劃草擬《條例草案》，我們已經就細節徵詢議員的意見。在提交立法會首讀前，我們已將很多建議納入了《條例草案》。

《條例草案》二讀後，法案委員會召開了共八次會議，我很感謝委員會主席周浩鼎議員和委員在審議過程中，全情投入，進一步提出寶貴意見及很多具體的建議。委員與政府推動控煙的決心是一致的，貫徹我們按循序漸進原則，推出控煙措施的政策方向，全方位抗擊煙禍。而因應民建聯特別是梁熙議員關注到控煙措施的生效日期，政府在審議過程中亦表明，控煙措施會分階段有序推行，敲定措施實施細節及生效日期的時候，會按既定機制徵詢立法會的意見，亦會有過渡期讓公眾和業界適應。我們盡量採納了委員會的建議，充分回應委員的關注，過程中亦一直有緊密交流，在此我特別要感謝所有委員提出的意見，進一步完善《條例草案》，包括在加味煙禁令下禁止和豁免物質逐項明文列出，與加拿大框架一致；提早禁止向18歲以下人士提供傳統或另類煙；延長更新健康忠告圖像過渡期，容許銷售商處理倉存，並同時協助政府釐清市民和業界對個別控煙措施存有的一些誤解，稍後我會在全體委員會審議階段提出修正案的時候詳加介紹。我留意到今日有議員提出修正案。我必須明確指出，有關議員的修正案會嚴重破壞控煙工作，政府在法案委員會階段已經在政策和執行層面上闡述議員修正案對控煙工作造成的影響，稍後我亦會在全體委員會審議階段的時候詳細講解。

主席，煙草產品每年導致超過800萬人死亡，當中大約120萬人因為吸入二手煙而失去生命。每兩名吸煙人士就有一名因為吸煙而提早死亡。這不是一個冰冷的數字，而是無數破碎的家庭的一個現實。

事實上，香港仍然有58萬煙民，煙民長期吸煙會引致各種嚴重的疾病。作為醫務衞生局局長，更曾經作為一名前線醫生，我耳聞目睹過太多本來可避免的慘劇──肺病患者的氣喘聲、中風病人的殘障、心臟病猝逝者親人的哭聲。煙草殘害患者和摯親的身心，很多受煙害的人士往往悔不當初。四十年前的已故國際巨星尤伯連納，以及今年身故的香港政商名人何柱國先生，他們的肺腑之言，觸動人心，令很多人都對逝者哀傷，更令很多人對煙害很憤怒。而二、三手煙更禍及無辜。當煙害瀰漫至我們周邊孩童身邊的時候，我們失去的不只是健康，更是社會的未來。控煙正是對下一代的守護。

吸煙危害健康，而健康就是最大的財富。本地研究數據顯示，於二○二一年因為使用煙草而造成的健康問題估計引致相當於每年約82億港元的經濟損失，放任煙害蔓延，經濟損失勢將擴大。吸煙是最可預防的公共衞生威脅。香港在慢性疾病與人口老化雙重挑戰下，做好控煙工作已經不是一條選擇題，而是一條必答題。

為達致「無煙香港」的願景，政府整體控煙的政策是「立足科學、凝聚共識」。基於實證研究與海外成功經驗，政府在二○二三年提出以四大方面推動新一階段控煙工作，即「管供應、降需求」；「禁宣傳、減引誘」；「擴禁區、免煙害」；及「重教育、助戒煙」，並且展開公眾諮詢，九成市民支持進一步降低吸煙率，社會對「無煙香港」的呼聲成為主流。

政府仔細評估措施成效、操作性與公眾接受度後，在去年六月公布了短、中、長期控煙措施。正如我剛才發言所說，公布措施後我們廣泛聽取各界包括在座不少議員的意見，在提交《條例草案》首讀之前已經納入議員的建議，完善了措施的細節。《條例草案》的多項重要的安排正是在這個行政立法事前協商合作的背景下提出，包括不在條例指明重大措施包括完稅標籤、全煙害警示包裝、加味煙禁令的生效日期，將來按實際情況以「先訂立、後審議」方式另訂生效日期，以保留彈性和容許過渡安排。我們會分階段禁止管有另類煙，首階段容許管有煙機，是因應自由黨邵家輝議員提出的意見作出的調整。另外，為回應不同黨派議員對加味煙禁令和私煙問題的關注，我們將在落實打擊私煙措施後才禁售加味煙等。我理解很多議員都關注私煙執法的工作，政府會立法從針對團夥走私、關口申報、零售層面三方面加強打擊私煙法律框架，有關措施會在修訂條例刊憲後即時生效，以進一步遏止私煙。我們亦聽取了不同議員關於加味煙的意見，將會分階段執行加味煙禁售令，首階段先禁非薄荷煙，以及繼續容許入境市民和遊客攜帶加味煙入境自用。凡此種種顯示，我們向立法會提交的《條例草案》已經是一套已經廣泛吸納立法會和社會多方意見「控煙大合唱」，男女聲、高低音協調合作，成為一首推動「無煙香港」之歌。

法案委員會亦曾邀請社會各界就《條例草案》提交意見書，在法案委員會委員討論過程，以及議員剛才的發言當中，部分議員和個別團體憂慮加強控煙措施會影響經濟和旅遊業。事實上，控煙工作和經濟從來不是零和遊戲。我再三強調，控煙可以「贏健康」，而不一定會「輸經濟」。在立法會早前接獲的意見書當中，超過30份來自多個商業和專業界別的團體和人士支持，足以反映控煙和經濟並無衝突。有餐飲業的意見更指出，二○○七年時業界亦曾因擔心擴大禁煙區會導致生意大幅下滑，不過正式推出後，食肆生意不跌反升，證明「無煙餐廳」是真正具有吸引力的賣點，不少餐廳更以「無煙」作為宣傳亮點，成功吸引食客。我們同意有關觀點，相關經驗亦表明加強控煙不會打擊經濟。真正國際都會的魅力，在於清新空氣賦予市民的幸福感，在彰顯城市品質。再者，控煙是全球大勢。從提倡室內禁煙到加味煙禁令，世界各地控煙進程不斷深化。「控煙十招」不存在政府「去得好盡」，亦未有要求要「贏到最盡」，事實是香港要「追落後」。政府想「大家贏」。

另外，因應法案委員會就執行方面所提出的意見，衞生署會就新增罪行制定實施指引和部門間的協作和聯絡機制，確保日後執法流程上更加暢順，亦會在措施實施前向公眾加強解說，更會與旅遊業界保持緊密聯繫，透過不同渠道向旅客加強宣傳和推廣有關措施。

主席，如果《條例草案》得到立法會通過，將能為新一階段控煙措施提供法律基礎。首要重點是打擊私煙，確保其他控煙措施能夠發揮最大成效，以及防止新世代吸煙。加強打擊私煙的措施，以及禁止向18歲以下人士提供傳統或另類煙的規定，將會在修訂條例刊憲後即時生效。二手煙危害公眾健康，新一階段控煙措施將會增設禁煙區保護「老、幼、病、弱」，違反吸煙條例的定額罰款額亦會提高至3,000元，新增禁煙區和新的定額罰款額將於二○二六年一月一日生效。另類煙禁令實施超過三年，不少人士仍然接觸到另類煙，特別是電子煙，甚至以電子煙吸食含有依托咪酯的毒煙彈，為從根本打擊使用另類煙，二○二六年四月三十日起，我們會禁止在公眾地方管有另類煙用物質。為了「管供應」以及「禁宣傳」，我們會在二○二五年第三季推出完稅標籤制度先導計劃，目標於二○二七年第二季與全煙害警示包裝同步實施。加味煙是煙草商吸引新世代吸煙的伎倆，是毒藥包上糖衣，我們會在完稅標籤制度全面實施後，實施加味傳統煙的禁令。

除了《條例草案》建議的各項立法措施，我在此要指出，推動戒煙亦是控煙策略的重要一環，政府在推動戒煙和宣傳教育方面的工作從來沒有停下，包括近年增加戒煙服務的種類、服務點，以及服務名額，以及透過與教育界合作，提高學生對吸煙禍害的認識，營造無煙的氣氛。陳凱欣議員和郭玲麗議員特別關心學生及戒煙工作。我們會繼續深化戒煙工作，包括探討如何進一步善用地區康健中心和家庭醫生網絡，便利戒煙者尋找最適合和便捷的戒煙方法，以及加強對學生的宣傳教育工作。

主席，正如我在動議二讀《條例草案》的時候提到，控煙工作就如逆水行舟，不進則退，需要全社會多代人的持續和共同努力。控煙永遠在路上，從來沒有最後一哩路，但今日我們可以共同為控煙之路奠下重要的里程碑。我懇請議員以下一代福祉為念，回應社會期盼，支持和通過這條凝聚多方共識的《條例草案》和稍後動議的修正案。

我謹此陳辭，多謝主席。"

The delegation also visited the drug regulatory authority in Beijing to deepen exchanges and co-operation.

Representatives from the DH and the Hospital Authority today jointly met with the Party Committee Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission (BJHC), Mr Zhong Dongbo, for the annual bilateral exchange on health between Hong Kong and Beijing. The DH and the BJHC exchanged views and shared experiences on the prevention and control of communicable diseases. Topics included using artificial intelligence to assist in communicable disease surveillance, responding to mosquito-borne diseases (including dengue and chikungunya fever), and promoting vaccination among the members of the public, especially adults. They also shared experiences in training professional talent, the development of traditional Chinese medicine and regulatory matters.

""The DH renewed its five-year co-operation agreement in the field of public health with the BJHC yesterday (September 10). Today, both sides had in-depth discussions on the details for implementing the agreement, which will lay a solid foundation for steadfast and long-term co-operation in the future. The agreement will help further refine the public health systems of Beijing and Hong Kong, and strengthen our capabilities in controlling communicable diseases in order to collaboratively respond to public health emergencies, particularly in the integrated emergency responses to major respiratory infectious diseases,"" Dr Lam said.

Following the meeting, the DH delegation visited the Beijing Municipal Medical Products Administration (BMPA) and exchanged views with the Party Committee Secretary of the BMPA Leading Party Committee, Mr Sun Liguang, and Director of BMPA, Ms Cao Wei, on advancing the development of the drug regulatory regime and aligning with international standards.

The DH is actively preparing to establish the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation (CMPR) next year and will implement 'primary evaluation' for new drug registration in phases starting next year. The establishment of the CMPR will significantly promote medical innovation in Hong Kong. It will not only help innovative drugs and medical products on the Mainland enter international markets, but also attract overseas enterprises to invest in scientific and technological research and development in Hong Kong. This will enable both Hong Kong and global citizens to access high-quality innovative drugs and medical devices earlier and faster, highlighting the HKSAR's role as a 'super connector' and 'super value-adder',"" Dr Lam said.

The DH delegation will continue its visit to public health-related authorities in Beijing tomorrow (September 12)."

海關人員七月十五日在香港國際機場截查一名四十八歲的抵港男旅客，並在他攜帶的個人行李內檢獲約二萬零六百支未完稅香煙，估計市值約九萬二千七百元，應課稅值約六萬八千一百。該名旅客隨即被捕。他今日被判處監禁五個月和罰款二千元。

  Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passenger, aged 48, at Hong Kong International Airport on July 15. About 20 600 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from his personal baggage. The estimated market value was about $92,700, and the duty potential was about $68,100. He was subsequently arrested and was sentenced to five months' imprisonment and fined $2,000 today.

  In addition, Customs officers intercepted an incoming male passengers, aged 31, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (September 10). About 90 400 sticks of duty-not-paid cigarettes were seized from his personal baggage. The estimated market value was about $370,600, and the duty potential was about $298,800. He was subsequently arrested and was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and fined $1,500 today.

  Customs welcomes the sentences. The custodial sentences have imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflect the seriousness of the offences.

  Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, tobacco products are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.

Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form (eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002)."
基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-09-11 18:35,2025-09-11 18:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100698.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（九月十一日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱的輸入個案，涉及同一個家庭。

最新個案資料

兩名病人分別為79歲女子和75歲男子，住所位於沙田區。他們於八月三十日至九月六日到訪廣州市番禺區，九月九日開始出現發燒、頭痛和關節痛，女病人亦出現皮疹。他們昨日（九月十日）前往普通科門診診所求醫，兩人其後均被轉送到威爾斯親王醫院，並獲安排入院在無蚊環境下接受治療，目前情況穩定。他們的血液樣本經檢驗後，證實對基孔肯雅熱病毒呈陽性反應。

他們有一名家居接觸者，並沒有同行到廣州市，現時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

由於上述兩名病人於潛伏期身處廣州市，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，均屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並已把個案通報廣東省衞生當局。

本港今年累計錄得16宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案，全部屬輸入個案。本港在二○一六至二○一九年每年錄得介乎一至11宗輸入個案。

今年一月至七月，全球16個國家／地區共錄得超過24萬宗病例，當中約90宗為死亡個案。亞洲方面，二○二五年印度及印度尼西亞分別錄得超過32 000宗及17 000宗病例，其他錄得病例的地區包括內地、孟加拉國及斯里蘭卡等。雖然廣東省基孔肯雅熱的情況在八月下旬起已受到控制，每日只有零星新增個案，但現時全球多國仍爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

繼續加強防控

食物環境衞生署（食環署）繼續進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作，並於確診病人的住所及於病發後到過的地點加強防蚊和滅蚊工作，包括：


在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
每星期巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。


中心呼籲學校按照食環署的滅蚊指引，加強防止校園範圍積水的工作及清除蚊子滋生的地方，同時務必提醒教職員及學生時刻做好防蚊及個人保護措施，防範蚊傳疾病在校園傳播。

此外，中心港口衞生科繼續在各個口岸加強巡查，並提醒跨境公共交通營辦商及其他相關單位確保環境衞生良好及有效落實防蚊措施。此外，港口衞生科人員亦會向旅客派發宣傳單張、為抵港人士進行體溫篩查、為發燒或出現相關病徵的旅客進行健康評估，及在有需要時轉介旅客到醫院作出跟進。

使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：


先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

​
​​此外，食環署呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置汽水罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應經常保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"

His Excellency, Nasser Al-Busaidi (Ambassador of the Sultanate of Oman to China), Sheikh Nasser Al Harthy (Deputy President for Operations, Oman Investment Authority), Cliff (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Templewater, Mr Cliff Zhang), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good afternoon. It is an honour and privilege to stand before you today, and I am thrilled to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Oman Investment Authority (OIA) and Templewater for cohosting this exclusive ancillary event. This gathering is an excellent complement to the 10th Belt and Road Summit. Your initiative exemplifies the proactive spirit of international collaboration, and I applaud your efforts in bringing together senior executives, investors, and decision-makers to delve into strategic investment opportunities, cross-border partnerships, and innovative pathways for economic growth.

 The Belt and Road Summit itself, organised by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, stands as a premier global platform for advancing co-operation across the Belt and Road economies. Discussions in the Summit span critical sectors including finance and investment, innovation and technology, professional services, and infrastructure, all aimed at harnessing the immense opportunities presented by the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

 Hong Kong's role in this initiative is pivotal: we serve as the primary platform and super connector, leveraging our economic strengths, world-class talent, and unique position under ""one country, two systems"" to bridge East and West. By hosting this ancillary event, the OIA and Templewater are not only amplifying these dialogues but also highlighting Hong Kong's function as a gateway for capital flows and innovation between regions like Oman and Mainland China.

 Now, allow me to turn our attention to the remarkable progress in Oman-China relations, which deserves our warmest congratulations. Oman has emerged as a key partner in the Belt and Road Initiative, deepening its strategic partnership with China in ways that align perfectly with Oman's Vision 2040 for economic diversification and China's BRI objectives. In recent years, this collaboration has expanded across trade, investment, energy, infrastructure, and emerging sectors such as renewables, technology, and digital economy.

 As we envision the next phase of this collaboration, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to further facilitate and elevate Oman-China economic ties, drawing on our status as a leading international financial centre. Under ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong boasts a robust legal system, free capital flows, simple taxation, and a well-respected regulatory environment that attracts global investors. We are the world's largest offshore Renminbi (RMB) centre, facilitating seamless cross-border settlements and promoting RMB internationalisation along BRI routes. This is especially pertinent for Oman-China projects, where Hong Kong can bridge financing needs for infrastructure, green energy, and technology ventures, enabling efficient capital allocation and risk management.

 Our financial markets are experiencing great vitality, as reflected in the latest statistics. For the first eight months of this year, the Hong Kong stock market's average daily turnover reached US$31.9 billion, a remarkable 132 per cent increase from the same period last year. Funds raised through initial public offerings totalled US$17.3 billion, surging 579 per cent. These figures underscore growing investor confidence and our market's remarkable financing capability. There are now more than 100 Belt and Road companies listed on our stock exchange, and we expect more to come.

 Beyond traditional finance, Hong Kong excels in green and sustainable finance, ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments, and carbon markets that align with Oman's renewables ambitions and China's digital-green BRI focus. For instance, we can connect the OIA's sovereign wealth with Chinese enterprises through joint ventures, co-investments, and innovative financing structures.

 Furthermore, Hong Kong's role extends to digital innovation and professional services, where we support BRI projects through fintech solutions, legal arbitration, and talent exchanges. By strengthening linkages with Oman and China, we can unlock new avenues in areas like smart logistics, e-commerce, and renewable energy infrastructure, ensuring that collaborations are not just transactional but transformative.

 In essence, Hong Kong is more than a facilitator - we are a catalyst for deeper, more resilient Oman-China co-operation. Through our financial prowess, innovative ecosystems and unwavering commitment to the BRI, we can help shape a shared future of inclusive growth, sustainability, and mutual prosperity.

 Thank you once again to the OIA and Templewater for this gracious invitation. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to forge even stronger ties that will benefit our economies and peoples for generations to come. Thank you.

The Labour Department (LD) welcomes the decision.

  The case involved a fatal accident that occurred on December 14, 2022, at a construction site in Yau Tong. A worker, while dismantling an I-beam, was struck and killed by the suddenly collapsed I-beam.

  Aggressive Construction Engineering Limited, High Grade Engineering Limited and a contractor were prosecuted by the LD for the violations of the Factories and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance and its subsidiary regulations, and were fined $36,000, $43,000 and $35,000 respectively at Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts on October 31, 2024.

  After the sentencing, the Government filed a review application with the court regarding the fines imposed on the relevant contractors. The review hearing was brought up today before the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts. The fines imposed on Aggressive Construction Engineering Limited, High Grade Engineering Limited and the contractor were increased to $74,000, $79,000 and $74,000 respectively.

  A spokesman for the LD said that the ruling reflects the severity of occupational safety and health offences, and will disseminate a clear message to all contractors that they have to protect workers' safety and health at work in accordance with the laws. The Government will continue to pay attention to court rulings and will file review applications for cases where the sentences are relatively light."

Among the first batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 20 survey areas in September, all were below 10 per cent.

Among these 20 survey areas, 13 recorded a decrease or remained unchanged in the individual gravidtrap index as compared to the Area Gravidtrap Index last month, i.e. August 2025, representing that the areas' mosquito infestation improved or maintained a low level. Seven other areas recorded a slight increase, but the indexes were lower than 10 per cent.

Public participation is crucial to effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including:

tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
remove all unnecessary water collection and eliminate the sources;
check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
change the water in flower vases and saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water; and
properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans.


Starting in August this year, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD will disseminate the relevant information through press releases, its website, and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.

Following the recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever. At present, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in 64 survey areas of the community. During the two weeks of surveillance, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes, to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data of the two weeks' surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures are available on the department's webpage (www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#)."

九月份第一批涵蓋20個監察地區的第一階段誘蚊器指數，全部都在10%以下。

與上月（即二○二五年八月）的分區白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數相比，這20個監察區中，13個監察地區的指數下跌或保持不變，代表蚊患情況改善或維持低水平；另有七區的指數輕微上升，但指數低於10%。

要有效防治蚊患，市民大眾的參與至關重要。食環署呼籲市民攜手合作，加強個人防蚊措施，包括：

收拾處所，並檢查處所內是否有容器積水；
清除積水並消除滲漏源頭；
檢查家居用品（尤其是存放於戶外露天地方的用品），例如垃圾桶、花盆、冷氣機底盤、晾衣架等，避免出現積水；
最少每星期一次更換花瓶和盆栽墊盤裏的水；
妥善蓋好所有盛水容器，以防成蚊接觸水面；及
妥善處置能盛水的物品，例如空飯盒和空罐。


食環署自今年八月起，每當個別監察地區完成調查並得出最新的誘蚊器指數和密度指數，食環署會通過新聞公布、網頁及社交媒體發放相關資訊，目的是為讓市民可以更快掌握蚊患情況，一同加強控蚊工作，降低基孔肯雅熱的傳播風險。

食環署是按照世界衞生組織的建議及因應本港的情況，在過去曾經出現本地蚊傳疾病的地區，以及屋邨／屋苑、醫院和學校等人口密集的地方等，設置誘蚊器以監察可傳播基孔肯雅熱和登革熱的白紋伊蚊的滋生和分布情況。現時，食環署在社區64個監察地區放置誘蚊器，監察期為兩星期。食環署每周會收集誘蚊器一次。第一星期監察期完結後，食環署會立刻檢視收回的誘蚊器內的黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，以計算誘蚊器指數（第一階段）和密度指數（第一階段）。第二星期的監察期完結後，食環署會即時檢視黏膠板上是否有伊蚊成蚊，結合兩個星期的監察數據，從而計算分區誘蚊器指數和分區密度指數。有關各區的白紋伊蚊誘蚊器指數、密度指數及防蚊措施資料，請瀏覽食環署網頁（www.fehd.gov.hk/tc_chi/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#）。"

二零二五年第二季建造工程完成量統計數字,2025-09-11 16:30,2025-09-11 16:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100340.htm,"政府統計處今日（九月十一日）公布「建造工程完成量按季統計調查」的臨時結果。主要承建商於二零二五年第二季所完成的建造工程名義總值的總計為689億元，與上年同期比較大致維持不變。

剔除價格變動的影響後，臨時結果顯示以實質計算，主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值的總計於同期間下跌3.5%。以實質計算的建造工程完成量總值，是透過適當的物價指數去平減相應的建造工程完成量名義總值至二零零零年基期的價格水平計算而成。

按建造工程類別分析，於二零二五年第二季完成的私人地盤建造工程名義總值為172億元，較上年同期下跌18.6%。以實質計算，跌幅為20.9%。於二零二五年第二季完成的公營地盤建造工程名義總值較上年同期上升15.0%至312億元。以實質計算，升幅為11.6%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第二季所完成的非地盤建造工程名義總值為205億元，較上年同期輕微下跌0.7%。以實質計算，跌幅為3.6%。非地盤建造工程包括小規模新建工程及樓房裝飾、樓宇修葺及保養工程，和非地盤的電器設備安裝及保養工程。

按主要用途類別分析，住宅樓宇建造工程於二零二五年第二季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值為213億元，較上年同期上升3.2%。同期間，運輸工程於二零二五年第二季完成的地盤建造工程名義總值下跌16.5%至81億元。

以經季節性調整的數字按季比較，主要承建商於二零二五年第二季完成的建造工程名義總值較二零二五年第一季下跌2.9%。以實質計算，跌幅為3.6%。

主要承建商於二零二五年第二季所完成的建造工程總值臨時數字列載於表1。二零二五年第一季的修訂數字則列載於表2。

由於分判建造工程在建造業內十分普遍，一間建造業機構可以是某一合約的主要承建商，同時亦可以是另一合約的分判承建商。主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值，只包括該等建造業機構作為主要承建商合約中所完成的建造工程，而不包括其作為分判承建商所完成的建造工程。然而，分判承建商所完成的建造工程總值，應已包括在其受聘的主要承建商所完成的建造工程總值之內。

建造業機構單位的分類是採用「香港標準行業分類2.0版」。該行業分類用於各經濟統計調查，把經濟單位撥歸不同的行業類別。

更詳細的統計數字刊載於《建造工程完成量按季統計調查報告》。用戶可以在政府統計處網站（www.censtatd.gov.hk/tc/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1090002&scode=330）瀏覽及下載該刊物。

Construction output for second quarter of 2025,2025-09-11 16:30,2025-09-11 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100330.htm,"  The total gross value of construction works (GVCW) performed by main contractors in the second quarter of 2025 remained virtually unchanged in nominal terms compared to the same period a year earlier, standing at $68.9 billion, according to the provisional results of the Quarterly Survey of Construction Output released today (September 11) by the Census and Statistics Department (C&SD).

  After discounting the effect of price changes, the provisional results showed that the total GVCW performed by main contractors decreased by 3.5% in real terms over the same period. GVCW in real terms is derived by deflating the corresponding nominal value with an appropriate price index to the price level in the base period of 2000.

  Analysed by type of construction works, the GVCW performed at private sector sites totalled $17.2 billion in the second quarter of 2025, down by 18.6% in nominal terms over a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 20.9%. The GVCW performed at public sector sites increased by 15.0% in nominal terms over a year earlier to $31.2 billion in the second quarter of 2025. In real terms, it increased by 11.6%.

  The GVCW performed by main contractors at locations other than construction sites amounted to $20.5 billion in the second quarter of 2025, slightly down by 0.7% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier. In real terms, it decreased by 3.6%. Construction works at locations other than construction sites included minor new construction activities and decoration, repair and maintenance for buildings; and electrical equipment installation and maintenance works at locations other than construction sites.

  Analysed by major end-use group, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of residential buildings projects amounted to $21.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025, up by 3.2% in nominal terms over a year earlier. Over the same period, the GVCW performed at construction sites in respect of transport projects down by 16.5% in nominal terms to $8.1 billion in the second quarter of 2025.

  On a seasonally adjusted quarter-to-quarter basis, the GVCW performed by main contractors decreased by 2.9% in nominal terms and 3.6% in real terms in the second quarter of 2025 compared with the first quarter of 2025.

  Table 1 shows the provisional figures on the GVCW performed by main contractors in the second quarter of 2025. Table 2 shows the revised figures for the first quarter of 2025.

  Owing to the widespread sub-contracting practices in the construction industry, a construction establishment can be a main contractor for one contract and a sub-contractor for another contract at the same time. The GVCW performed by main contractors covers only those projects in which the construction establishment takes the role of a main contractor, but not projects in which it takes only the role of a sub-contractor. However, sub-contractors' contribution to projects should have been included in the GVCW performed by main contractors for whom they worked.

  The classification of construction establishments follows the Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification Version 2.0, which is used in various economic surveys for classifying economic units into different industry classes.

  More detailed statistics are given in the ""Report on the Quarterly Survey of Construction Output"". Users can browse and download this publication at the website of the C&SD (www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1090002&scode=330).

​
尊敬的馮飛書記（海南省委書記）、徐衞剛部長（中央人民政府駐香港特別行政區聯絡辦公室經濟部部長）、各位嘉賓、各位朋友：

下午好！很高興出席今天海南省人民政府2025年全球投資者路演活動。首先，請讓我對遠道而來、親臨香港路演的馮飛書記和海南的嘉賓朋友們表示最熱烈的歡迎，也對長期以來支持和推動瓊港合作的朋友們表示最衷心的感謝！

海南省是我們發展債券市場的好夥伴，一直以來對香港的金融服務和債券市場高度信任和支持。正如剛才馮書記所説，連同這一次，海南省人民政府自二○二二年起，已經連續四年在香港發行債券，累計發行額預計達到180億元人民幣。這次發債所得除了繼續支持海南的綠色和藍色項目外，也首次加入以航天為主題的10年期債券。這有幾方面的重要意義。一是為內地地方政府集資在領域和渠道上拉開了新維度；二是讓我國航天的重點科研和基建通過香港走進國際投資者的視線，提升我國前沿科技的能見度；三是豐富了人民幣債券和投資產品的譜系，為推進人民幣國際化作出貢獻。

在「一國兩制」下，香港憑着內聯外通、國際化和多元包容的獨特優勢，一直扮演「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，助力內地和國際市場在資金、技術、標準、人才等多方面的連接與互通。多年來，在中央的堅實支持下，香港成為了內地企業和項目首選的籌融資市場。今年以來，在地緣政治的陰霾下，港股的表現仍然亮麗，恒生指數上升了約30%，平均每天成交量約2,500億港元，同比增長1.3倍，流動性大幅增加。海南省選擇在這個時候在港發行新一批債券並在港交所（香港交易及結算所有限公司）掛牌，可謂正值其時，相信會為我們引來更多國際投資者。

事實上，香港的債務市場正穩步發展。在中央的支持下。國家財政部已經連續17年在香港發行人民幣國債，累計發行額超過4,100億元；去年，香港點心債的發行總額達到一萬億元人民幣，同比上升約37%。隨着國際間對人民幣投資和風險管理產品的需求增加，未來離岸人民幣債市的發展將會更蓬勃，有利人民幣國際化的穩慎推進。

此外，香港繼續是亞洲的綠色和可持續金融樞紐，去年在香港發行的相關債務總額超過800億美元，其中在香港安排發行的綠色債券總額，佔了亞洲市場的45%，涵蓋不同年期和幣種，滿足不同投資者的需要。此外，除了香港和內地的發行人外，也有多個亞太和歐洲國家的企業和機構在港發行綠債。在當前部分西方國家對氣候承諾出現倒退之際，香港更要發展好綠色金融市場，積極貢獻國家以至全球的綠色轉型進程。

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，從國際投資者更多投向大中華地區，到全球的綠色轉型；從支持企業和項目出海，到穩慎推進人民幣國際化，這些趨勢都正好讓香港「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色更充分發揮。我們熱烈歡迎海南省以至全國的企業和項目來港、發行債券、上市，以至設立財資中心或跨國供應鏈管理中心等，充分用好香港這個平台，壯大自身的發展。我期待瓊港兩地加強合作，共同為國家的強國建設以及高質量發展，作出新的、更大的貢獻。

最後，我祝願海南省人民政府這次的債券發行圓滿成功，也祝願在座各位朋友身體健康、事業宏達。謝謝大家！"

Eric (Chief Public Mission Officer of the Hong Kong Cyberport Management Company Limited, Mr Eric Chan), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you today at the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme Showcase Seminar for celebrating the results of the Scheme and exchanging views on the development of green and sustainable fintech. First of all, I would like to thank Cyberport for their efforts in promoting the development of a green fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong, which includes a well-supported green fintech community to mutually share expertise and knowledge, with various opportunities for companies to test out innovative ideas and concepts as well as cross-sector collaborations. Today's Seminar exactly provides a vibrant platform bringing together key stakeholders and market participants to chart the way forward for further accelerating the development of green fintech in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong as Asia's leading green finance centre

 The financial market serves as a vital conduit for channelling international capital towards sustainable initiatives that support the green transition. As Asia's leading sustainable finance hub, Hong Kong has a significant role to play in this endeavour. In 2024, the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged in Hong Kong amounted to around US$43 billion, capturing around 45 per cent of the regional total and ranking first in the Asian market for seven consecutive years since 2018. Besides, as of June 2025, the number of environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission was over 200 with assets under management of over HK$1.1 trillion. The number of ESG funds and assets under management recorded an increase of 51 per cent and 18 per cent respectively from three years ago.

 To further strengthen our competitive advantage, a key priority is to position Hong Kong as a green fintech hub. Green fintech, which seamlessly combines our strengths in green finance and fintech, has immense potential to drive the transformation of the green economy. Over years of development, Hong Kong has developed a dynamic fintech ecosystem, with over 1 100 fintech companies, many of which are engaged in green or ESG-related businesses.

Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme

 The Government is keen to support the development of green fintech and launched the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Funding Support Scheme in June last year. This initiative provides early-stage funding to technology companies and research institutes engaged in green fintech activities, enabling them to collaborate with local enterprises on new projects that address industry pain points. The Scheme supports the commercialisation of solutions and the completion of proof-of-concept stages, facilitating the wider adoption of green and sustainable fintech solutions within Hong Kong's business landscape. We are glad that 60 projects, covering a wide range of areas including green and digital finance and investment; ESG disclosure; compliance and regulatory reporting; carbon trading, analytics and technology; ESG data, intelligence and analytics; and ESG/climate risk modelling and assessment, have been approved under the Scheme. Stay tuned for the showcase sessions today, which will highlight the innovative green and sustainable fintech solutions funded under this Scheme.

Hong Kong Green Fintech Map

 Apart from funding support, we also see the need to raise the profile and visibility of our green fintech companies. In March last year, we published the Prototype Hong Kong Green Fintech Map, which serves as a one-stop resource for information on the current status of green fintech companies in Hong Kong and the services they offer. An updated version of the Map was released in June this year, with an increase in the total number of green fintech companies from around 50 to over 60.

Innovative green investment products

 In parallel with cultivating the green fintech ecosystem, we also well utilise green fintech to foster product innovation and development. Among the green bonds issued by the Government, we introduced two batches of tokenised green bonds, which represented the world's first government tokenised green bond and the world's first multi-currency digital bond respectively. These initiatives highlight Hong Kong's strengths in integrating the bond market, green and sustainable finance, and fintech. Both issuances featured multiple innovations, including a shortened settlement cycle to T+1. The second issuance also broadened investor access, supported interoperability, and improved transparency and efficiency. These initiatives provide benchmarks and references for potential issuers in the market. The Government will regularise the issuance of tokenised bonds, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is preparing to assist the Government in issuing its third tokenised bond.

 Regarding the carbon market, the HKMA and the HKEX (Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited) are collaborating on Project Ensemble to experiment with the feasibility of using tokenised deposits and central bank digital currency for interbank settlements, and to explore the feasibility of tokenising real-world assets, including carbon credits, using blockchain technology.

Technology to support sustainability reporting

 As global awareness of sustainable development continues to rise, we are keen to support enterprises in utilising data and technology tools for sustainability reporting. We launched a free-for-use greenhouse gas emissions calculation and estimation tool in February last year, which aims to help corporations in need to manage their environmental footprint while encouraging market participants to enhance their sustainable practices. The tool outlines its methodology and data sources, incorporating elements from both Hong Kong and the Mainland. To further encourage sustainability disclosures and improve data applicability, we will continue to collaborate with various stakeholders to facilitate better sustainability disclosures through the use of this tool.

Use of artificial intelligence to address sustainability challenges

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently a trending topic. A study last year found that the adoption of GenAI (generative artificial intelligence) is progressing steadily across the financial services industry in Hong Kong, with 75 per cent of the surveyed financial institutions having already implemented at least one GenAI use case, or currently piloting and designing use cases and exploring potential investment areas. One example of the applications is using AI to manage greenwashing risk. They attempt to achieve this by conducting thorough analyses of the climate impact of their activities, tracking progress towards emission targets, and generating evidence-based climate reports that encompass progress, engagements, and outcomes.

 In view of the trending application of AI technology, we issued a policy statement in October last year to introduce our policy stance towards the responsible application of AI in the financial market. Since the policy statement was issued, we have introduced various initiatives to assist the financial institutions in seizing the opportunities and adopting AI responsibly, including publishing practical guidelines, launching sandbox schemes, as well as organising seminars and talks for practitioners.

 Ladies and gentlemen, we are committed to working closely with tech firms, research institutes, financial institutions, and other stakeholders to foster co-creation partnerships, accelerate commercial adoption, and strengthen Hong Kong's sustainable finance ecosystem. Together, we can embrace innovation and create a sustainable future. I wish you all a fruitful and inspiring day. Thank you."
首間柬埔寨銀行在港設立代表辦事處　彰顯香港在「一帶一路」倡議下區域金融樞紐角色（附圖）,2025-09-11 15:40,2025-09-11 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100282.htm,"​投資推廣署（投資署）今日（九月十一日）宣布，柬埔寨領先金融集團之一的加華銀行已獲香港金融管理局（金管局）批核在香港設立代表辦事處，標誌着香港與柬埔寨以及整個東南亞國家聯盟（東盟）地區深化經貿合作的重要里程碑。

去年七月行政長官李家超率領代表團在柬埔寨與加華集團主席方僑生博士會面是促成是次設立代表辦事處的關鍵。雙方討論聚焦於香港作為亞洲領先國際金融中心的獨特優勢，並探討雙方深化合作的機遇。這些會談以促進雙方的共同發展為目標，並為是次辦事處的設立奠定基礎。

加華銀行成立於一九九一年，是加華集團旗下的公司，為個人、企業和公司提供全面的銀行服務，目前在柬埔寨擁有69間分行和430個自助數碼櫃檯，總資產達86億美元，並在老撾設有子公司。

​加華集團旗下分為金融和非金融小組，總資產達150億美元，擁有17 500名員工。其金融小組由加華投資控股主導，提供包括銀行、小額信貸、人壽和一般保險、證券和信託在內的多種金融服務；非金融小組則由海外柬華投資公司主導，主要業務涵蓋基礎設施、建築和房地產開發、教育、酒店和醫療服務。該公司成立於二○○三年，是柬埔寨投資規模和項目數量最大的基礎設施和房地產開發商，其著名項目包括德崇國際機場（鄰近首都金邊的新機場）、鑽石島衛星城、金銀島衛星城、水淨華衛星城和奧林匹亞城市商業地標等。

投資推廣署署長劉凱旋表示：「我們歡迎加華銀行在香港設立代表辦事處。香港是東盟企業進入全球市場的首選樞紐，我們將繼續協助柬埔寨企業於香港擴展業務、善用香港資本市場，並與區內戰略夥伴建立聯繫。」

她續說：「香港擁有一流的金融制度和專業服務，可以積極貢獻柬埔寨的經濟發展，同時還能從中獲得豐富的商機。投資推廣署將繼續和金管局合作，吸引更多銀行來港開業，進一步推動香港金融市場的繁榮。」

加華銀行主席方僑生博士表示：「我們在港開設首間代表辦事處，標誌着我們透過香港擴張業務的重要一步。我們感謝投資署在過程中提供的支持，包括與香港監管機構舉行會議、提供有關牌照要求和有關資訊，以及與服務提供者建立聯繫。」

「隨着我們在九月九日啓動位於金邊的新世界級德崇國際機場的營運，我們將通過代表處以及利用『一帶一路』倡議的機遇，繼續努力加強柬埔寨與香港之間的經濟聯繫。」他補充說。

「一帶一路」倡議在推動香港與柬埔寨深化經濟融合方面發揮了關鍵作用。加華銀行代表辦事處的成立，將進一步促進跨區域貿易與投資合作，為兩地經濟發展帶來長遠利利益。

二○二四年，中國是柬埔寨最大貿易夥伴，雙邊貿易額突破180億美元，按年增長21%。此強勁增長趨勢突顯了構建高效金融網絡的重要性，以支援日益頻繁的跨境貿易與投資活動，並進一步鞏固香港作為區域金融樞紐的角色。

"Leading Cambodian bank establishes representative office in Hong Kong, highlighting city's role as regional financial hub under Belt and Road Initiative (with photo)",2025-09-11 15:40,2025-09-11 15:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100285.htm," âInvest Hong Kong (InvestHK) announced today (September 11) that Canadia Bank, one of Cambodia's leading financial conglomerates, has established a representative office in Hong Kong. This was approved by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and marks a significant step in strengthening the economic ties between Hong Kong and Cambodia, as well as between the city and the broader Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region.

 This milestone follows the pivotal meeting in Cambodia in July 2024 between a delegation led by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, and the Chairman of Canadia Integrated Group, Dr Pung Kheav Se. The meeting centred on the unique advantages of Hong Kong as Asia's leading international financial centre and opportunities to deepen collaboration between the two places. These considerations laid the foundation for this new establishment, which aims to foster mutual growth and prosperity.

 Founded in 1991, Canadia Bank is part of the Canadia Integrated Group, and offers a comprehensive suite of banking services to individuals, businesses, and corporations. With total assets of US$8.6 billion, Canadia Bank Plc currently has 69 operating branches and 430 self-service digital devices in Cambodia, as well as a subsidiary in Laos.

 Canadia Integrated Group comprises a financial and non-financial group with total assets of US$15 billion and a total of 17 500 employees. The financial group is led by Canadia Investment Holding, which offers a number of financial services including banking, microfinance, life and general insurance, securities, and trusts. The non-financial group is led by Overseas Cambodian Investment Corporation, and its primary business activities are infrastructure, construction and property development, education, hotel and medical services. Established in 2003, the company is the largest and leading infrastructure and property developer in Cambodia by investment size and number of projects developed, with notable projects such as the Techo International Airport (a new airport near the capital city of Phnom Penh), Diamond Island Satellite City, Norea Island Satellite City, Chroy Changvar Satellite City and the Olympia City Complex.

 The Director-General of Investment Promotion, Ms Alpha Lau, said, ""We are delighted to welcome Canadia Bank to Hong Kong as they establish their representative office here. Hong Kong continues to be the preferred hub for ASEAN companies seeking to access global markets. We look forward to supporting Cambodian companies in expanding their business through leveraging Hong Kong's capital markets and connecting with strategic partners in the region.""

 ""Hong Kong has a world-class financial system and professional services that can contribute to Cambodia's economic development, while Hong Kong can also gain many business opportunities during the process. InvestHK will continue to work closely with the HKMA to attract more banks to set up in Hong Kong and enrich the city's financial market,"" she added.

 Dr Pung, who is also the Chairman of Canadia Bank, said, ""The opening of our first representative office in the the city marks a significant step in our expansion plan via Hong Kong. We appreciate the support from InvestHK during the process, including setting up meetings with the regulators in Hong Kong, providing us with useful information about the licensing requirements and procedures, and connecting us with service providers.""

 ""In commencing operations of the new world-class Techo International Airport in Phnom Penh on September 9, we will strive to continue strengthening economic ties between Cambodia and Hong Kong through our representative office as well as leveraging Belt and Road Initiative opportunities,"" he added.

 The Belt and Road Initiative has played a pivotal role in fostering closer economic integration between Hong Kong and Cambodia. The establishment of Canadia Bank's representative office contributes to advancing trade and investment co-operation and bringing long-term benefits to both economies.

 In 2024, China was Cambodia's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade surpassing US$18 billion, marking a 21 per cent increase compared to 2023. This strong growth trend underscores the importance of building an efficient financial network to support the increasing volume of cross-border trade and investment activities, further reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a regional financial hub.

​民政及青年事務局局長在《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》獲通過後會見傳媒談話內容,2025-09-11 15:38,2025-09-11 15:45,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100557.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局（民青局）局長麥美娟今日（九月十一日）下午在立法會通過《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》後會見傳媒的談話內容：

民政及青年事務局局長：首先感謝立法會剛剛通過了《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》，令我們可以有一個框架去規範籃球博彩。正如我在會上多次提出，政府是不鼓勵賭博，針對非法賭博猖獗的問題，我們採取多管齊下的措施。首先是嚴厲執法，其次是宣傳教育，第三是為有需要人士提供輔導服務，第四是最後一招，就是當非法賭博問題猖獗至需要透過一個規範化的、有節制的渠道，將一些非法賭博的資金導入至一個有限制的、有規範化的渠道，所以我們提供一個規範的博彩框架，即是今次籃球博彩的框架。

剛才會上有議員也引述了我之前多次強調，我們做了這個籃球博彩規範框架，並不是就停在這裏。針對非法賭博猖獗問題，我們一定會持續透過宣傳教育，透過嚴厲執法繼續打擊。在此再次藉這個機會提醒所有市民，就非法賭博而言，不單是開賭的人受刑罰，參與非法賭博，即是參與一些非法的網上投注也好，一經定罪，是可以被判處監禁九個月和罰款。所以我再次提醒市民，千萬不要以身試法參與非法賭博，大家亦要知道沉迷賭博的禍害，一定要有節制地參與，希望市民大眾和我們一起將這些沉迷賭博禍害的信息告訴身邊的家人和青年朋友。

即使未規範籃球博彩框架前，我們已要求馬會（香港賽馬會）增加資源予平和基金去採取更多措施，在社會上宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害，以及為青年朋友做更多宣傳教育工作。未來我們會增加一間中心，平和基金現時有四間中心，都是輔導中心。我們會認真檢視這些輔導中心的工作成效，也會增加第五間中心，特別針對青年朋友進行宣傳教育工作。我們希望大家攜手，透過多管齊下的方法，可以在社會上打撃非法賭博行為和宣傳教育市民沉迷賭博的禍害。

記者：剛才有議員引述二○○三年足球合法賭博後的數據，其實未能減少非法賭博，亦令賭博增加了，你怎樣回應這些議員的看法？現時政府是打算將一些非法資金流回正規渠道，是否真的能做到呢？另外想問區議員葉吉江因為危險駕駛被停職一星期，是怎樣得出一個星期的懲處時長？最長的懲處時長是兩星期，怎樣的範例才會是兩星期懲處呢？謝謝。

民政及青年事務局局長：第一個問題，我也有留意有立法會議員，像是陸頌雄所說，足球博彩投注額的增加，不能單說當時是這麼多，現時是這麼多，就是增加了足球博彩，當中都有很多不同的社會因素。不過如果大家這樣看，就是我們一直以來的監察，透過馬會或其他監察，皆看到當我們提供規範化足球博彩的渠道，在非法渠道，無論是網站的點擊率或資金的流入都會下降，甚至有些下降超過一半，所以當有規範的渠道，便可以將一些非法的賭博資金導入合法的渠道。正如剛才我多次強調，打擊非法賭博不是單靠提供規範化的框架，更重要的是多管齊下，包括嚴厲的執法行動、宣傳教育和為有需要人士提供輔導服務。我們是多管齊下工作，也希望社會人士和我們一起將非法賭博的禍害和參與非法投注是犯法的信息，一起宣傳開去，我相信公眾教育的宣傳工作需要大家一起合作，包括政府、議會、議員和社會各界人士，大家一起做，令大家明白賭博的禍害。

至於第二個問題，今屆區議會，我們新引入了一個履職監察制度。根據《區議會條例》第72C條，當民青局局長收到區議員的聯署後，可以委任一個監察委員會，決定被投訴議員的行為是否失當、是否影響公眾對區議會的期望和影響區議會的聲譽，並且由監察委員會向局長建議施加哪種懲罰。法例列明監察委員會在考慮了個案後，可以建議幾種懲罰，包括勸喻、警告、罰款，最嚴厲就是停職。根據《區議員履職監察制度指引》，首次被暫停職務的期限最多為兩星期。監察委員會是會考慮整件案件，包括相關的證據，被投訴區議員的態度、行為表現，決定向局長建議施加哪一種處分。今次委員會在考慮案情後，向我建議停職一星期，並且停薪。在這段期間，相關區議員不能以區議員的身分行事，但其辦事處可以提供有限度服務給市民，惟必須於辦事處外張貼告示通知市民相關區議員被停職，以確保地區服務不會受影響。

至於甚麼時候用哪一種處分呢？這個首次引入的區議員履職監察制度以往是沒有的，所以以往如果針對區議員的違規或違法行為，除非他們已達《區議會條例》中所說的取消區議員資格的門檻，否則不會採取到任何的行動。所以我們在今屆區議會新引入這個履職監察制度，以確保每一個區議員都是盡責履職，亦確保每一個區議員的行為都是符合公眾期望。為了彰顯這個制度的獨立性和公平性，所以由一個監察委員會考慮整件事，然後向局長建議適當的處分。當每一件事件發生後，都會由不同成員組成委員會考慮當時情況，向局長建議適當的處分，以確保這個處分是能夠彰顯這個制度的公平和獨立性，亦確保每一個區議員都是盡責履職。謝謝。

懲教署更生服務研究組於二○二四年二月起和香港中文大學（中大）心理學系就終止犯罪展開合作研究，與51名更生人士及60名在囚人士進行訪談及焦點小組討論，涵蓋成人、青少年、男性及女性不同群組，並進行深入分析，整合出本地更生人士改過自新的歷程及關鍵因素。

中大心理學系研究教授梁永亮教授在研討會上公布研究結果時指出，透過更生服務以正面的方法滿足更生人士對關愛及個人能力的內心需要，有助他們改過自新及遠離犯罪。研究歸納出三個關鍵因素，包括提供多元化的學習機會、擴展正向社交支援網絡，以及培養及持續強化個人能力、自我身分認同與正向人際關係。研究亦顯示，懲教署的更生計劃不單有助降低更生人士的重犯機會，重塑奉公守法的新身分，重新連結社會，亦支援他們回饋社會，逐步轉化人生。

懲教署高級臨床心理學家李潔珊博士表示，研究結果確立署方在更生工作方面的成效，亦為未來發展帶來啓示。懲教署會參考研究結果，推展強項為本的更生策略及強化懲教職員更生領航員的角色，同時積極將更生服務由懲教院所延伸至社區，並支持更生人士回饋社會。

CSD holds seminar on correctional psychology research and practice (with photos),2025-09-11 15:13,2025-09-11 15:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100298.htm,"The Correctional Services Department (CSD) today (September 11) held the Desistance from Crime: Correctional Research and Practice Professional Seminar to disseminate the latest research findings in correctional psychology and to explore strategic directions for future rehabilitation and crime prevention work, with the participation of over 100 members of the rehabilitation services sector and scholars.

Since February 2024, the Correctional Rehabilitation Research Unit of the CSD, in collaboration with the Department of Psychology of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), has commenced a research initiative on desistance from crime. The research involved interviews and focus group discussions with 51 rehabilitated persons and 60 persons in custody, covering different groups including adults, adolescents, males and females. Through in-depth analysis, the research summarised desistance journeys of local rehabilitated persons and key factors to desist from crime.

The Research Professor of the Department of Psychology of the CUHK, Professor Patrick Leung, presented the research findings at the seminar. He said that, through rehabilitation services, addressing rehabilitated persons' inner needs for care and personal competence with a positive approach was found conducive to their rehabilitation and supportive of their desistance from crime. The research identified three key factors in rehabilitation, namely offering diverse learning opportunities, expanding positive social support networks, and nurturing and sustaining personal competence, self-identity and constructive interpersonal relationships. The research also indicated that the CSD's rehabilitation programmes not only help reduce recidivism among rehabilitated persons, rebuild their law-abiding identity and reconnect them with society, but also support them in giving back to society, thereby gradually transforming their lives.

Senior Clinical Psychologist of the CSD Dr Yvonne Lee stated that the research findings affirmed the effectiveness of the rehabilitation work of the CSD and brought insights for future development. Drawing on the findings, the CSD will advance strength-based rehabilitation strategies and reinforce the role of correctional officers as rehabilitation facilitators, while actively extending its rehabilitation services from correctional institutions to the community and supporting rehabilitated persons in giving back to society.

At the seminar, a clinical psychologist of the CSD introduced an innovative community-based rehabilitation initiative based on the theory of desistance from crime - ""Human Library: Desistance from Crime"". This pioneering initiative combines narrative therapy with a four-panel comic to showcase the life stories of rehabilitated persons, encouraging reflections on their past, disengagement from criminal behaviours and the cultivation of a positive lifestyle, thereby rewriting their futures. Furthermore, the Department arranged for a rehabilitated person to share his experiences in participating in psychological treatment programmes and his desistance journey. Dr Lee and Professor Leung also exchanged views with participants on the research findings, rehabilitation services and the directions for future development.

Upholding the spirit of moving with the times and evidence-based practice, the CSD will continue to organise academic events to actively promote collaboration and exchanges with members of the rehabilitation services sector and scholars to advance professional development and innovation of rehabilitation work through scientific research."

Reporter: So, what is the expected timeline for the roll out of legalising basketball betting, and what regulatory measures will be implemented to ensure responsible betting and protect vulnerable populations?

Secretary for Home and Youth Affairs: First of all, I would like to thank the Legislative Council for passing the Bill. After the passage of the Bill, we will move on to liaise with the Hong Kong Jockey Club about the terms of the licence and, after the negotiations and liaison, we will issue the licence to the operator, that is, the Hong Kong Jockey Club. I think they need some time to gear up, like implementing some IT measures and some facilities. We will announce the substantial timeline in the near future.

As for public education on how to educate and publicise the bad influence and effects of illegal betting and irresponsible gambling, we will launch a series of new measures including public education and publicity measures focusing on teenagers. We will also set up another new centre, which will focus on the education and publicity work for young people in the near future.

​立法會：民政及青年事務局局長就恢復二讀辯論《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》發言（只有中文）,2025-09-11 15:03,2025-09-11 15:15,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100484.htm,"以下是民政及青年事務局局長麥美娟今日（九月十一日）在立法會會議上就恢復二讀辯論《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》（《條例草案》）的發言：

主席：

我謹動議恢復二讀《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》。

首先，我特別感謝法案委員會主席陳振英議員和各位參與法案委員會的議員，以及立法會秘書處同事付出的努力，令審議《條例草案》的工作得以順利完成，並可以在今日恢復二讀辯論。我亦感謝剛才發言支持《條例草案》二讀的各位議員，以及各位提出的寶貴意見。

正如我在動議二讀《條例草案》時提到，政府一貫的政策是不鼓勵賭博。針對賭博問題，政府採取多管齊下的策略，包括透過執法打擊非法賭博活動、透過公眾教育宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害、為有需要人士提供輔導和支援服務。而最後一項措施是透過法例規管賭博活動。政府提供合法賭博途徑的目的，只在於回應市民對某些賭博活動的需求，以免他們轉向非法的經營者下注。

《條例草案》的目的，是透過修訂《博彩稅條例》（第108章）及附屬法例，訂立籃球博彩活動的規管框架，賦權民政及青年事務局局長發出營運籃球博彩的牌照，並制定相關牌照條件，以減少賭博對市民，尤其是青少年的不良影響。

今年四至五月，我們就籃球博彩規管制度進行了為期一個月的諮詢，收到的意見絕大部分支持設立相關制度。我們亦向立法會民政及文化體育事務委員會簡介諮詢結果和相關規管制度，並得到委員會支持。

其後，法案委員會詳細審視了《條例草案》的條文。我們感謝法案委員會對《條例草案》提出不少寶貴的意見，而政府在法案委員會上亦已就委員提出的事項，包括打擊非法賭博和預防賭博等方面的工作作出詳細解釋。

我感謝剛才發言的28位議員，也感謝議員支持《條例草案》和就《條例草案》提出了寶貴的意見。接下來，我會綜合回應議員的意見和觀察，以及簡單總結及回應法案委員會在審議《條例草案》時較關注的事項。

第一，是有關籃球博彩規範化的政策考慮。有見參與非法籃球賭博人數不少，顯示社會上有切實而持續的需求，因此近年有不少社會人士關注非法籃球賭博的影響。在此情況下，為有效打擊非法賭博活動，政府決定訂立籃球博彩活動的規管框架，以免資金流向非法渠道，以及加強保障投注人士。若《條例草案》獲通過，政府計劃參考足球博彩模式以香港賽馬會（馬會）為唯一營運商。

第二，有議員關注打擊網上非法賭博活動的問題。香港警務處一直有既定策略打擊非法賭博活動，例如進行網上巡邏及透過不同渠道搜集情報、作出調查，並且在取得足夠證據後採取執法行動。近兩年半，警方曾向網站營運商發出至少300個移除涉及非法賭博活動網站的要求。二○二四年，警方總共拘捕了5 341人，涉及各類型的非法賭博罪行。

同時，我們也會加強宣傳參與非法賭博的刑罰。簡單來說，不僅開賭會受刑罰，下注也會受刑罰。根據《賭博條例》（第148章），非法收受賭注，即開賭，最高可以被判處罰款港幣500萬元和監禁七年。而參與非法賭博，即投注者，他們都是違法，一經定罪，最高可被判處罰款港幣五萬元和監禁九個月。在設立規管框架後，我們會繼續密切監察非法賭博趨勢，採取宣傳教育及執法雙管齊下的措施，以進一步打擊各類型非法賭博活動。

第三，在預防沉迷賭博問題方面，我們會持續進行兩方面的重點工作，包括施加嚴謹的法律與規管約束，以減少賭博對市民的不良影響；以及通過加強平和基金在提供輔導、治療服務、教育和宣傳活動的工作，以提升公眾對沉迷賭博禍害的認識。其中，雖然青少年參與賭博的比例在過去幾年一直維持在低水平，我們仍會增撥資源，在現時資助的四間輔導中心以外，設立專注於為青少年提供輔導及支援服務的新中心，向青少年樹立正確的法律觀和價值觀，特別是通過宣傳教育提醒青少年，參與非法賭博、向非法收受賭注者投注已屬違法。

我們知道很多議員對平和基金的工作有很多意見和建議，正如我在事務委員會和法案委員會會議時，已經多次重申，我們會檢討現在平和基金的各項工作，尤其是現在四間輔導中心的工作成效。

主席，有議員提出對規範籃球博彩的憂慮和擔心，不過正如我在法案委員會和事務委員會所說，剛才亦有議員引述，政府在打擊非法賭博的工作並不止於今次修訂條例規範籃球博彩，我們會不斷和加大力度採取執法行動打擊非法賭博。我們也有新措施，向社會宣傳沉迷賭博的禍害，尤其是針對青年人的宣傳教育工作。我們不是單單規範籃球博彩來打擊非法賭博，而是會持續、不斷以不同手法加強打擊非法賭博。規範籃球博彩只是其中一項措施打擊非法賭博，正如議員所說，我們不止於此，還會有其他的措施持續進行。

亦有多名議員提出，若香港賽馬會獲發籃球博彩牌照之後，是否應該增加撥款支持體育發展？馬會現時將大約90%的稅後經營盈餘撥捐予馬會慈善信託基金，推動多個重點策略範疇，包括青年發展及扶貧和體育及文化等。信託基金已審批的慈善捐款金額由二○○三／○四年度的9.75億港元增至二○二三／二四年度的102億港元。政府亦已要求馬會繼續投放更多資源和撥出額外的資金，持續推動包括體育發展和青年培訓在內的各種慈善及公益工作。

剛才也有議員提到，馬會在今年六月公布撥款4.5億港元，作為香港賽區唯一合作夥伴，支持籌辦第十五屆全國運動會及全國第十二屆殘疾人運動會暨第九屆特殊奧林匹克運動會。馬會最近亦公布撥款逾7千萬港元，資助非牟利機構舉辦一系列籃球訓練及活動，以推動本地籃球體育發展。我們會繼續要求馬會對香港的慈善和體育發展作出更大貢獻。

主席，《條例草案》為籃球博彩活動訂立規管框架，透過將博彩需求導入受規管的合法渠道，以打擊非法籃球賭博活動。在《條例草案》通過後，我們會繼續與馬會、警務處、平和基金諮詢委員會、博彩及獎券事務委員會及其他持份者一起緊密合作，確保有效落實規管制度。我們亦將繼續採取多管齊下的策略，以積極有為的態度做好及優化預防及緩減與賭博有關問題的工作。

我懇請議員支持及通過《2025年博彩稅（修訂）條例草案》。

我謹此陳辭。多謝主席。"
SFST's special remarks at 10th Belt and Road Summit - Business Networking Luncheon (English only),2025-09-11 15:00,2025-09-11 15:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100347.htm,"  Following are the special remarks by the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Mr Christopher Hui, at the 10th Belt and Road Summit – Business Networking Luncheon on ""Connecting Growth Corridors – ASEAN and the Belt and Road"" today (September 11):

Luanne (Chief Executive Officer, Hong Kong, of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC), Ms Luanne Lim), Algernon (Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau), Professor Frederick Ma (Chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

 It is my great pleasure to join you at this exclusive luncheon hosted by HSBC during the Belt and Road Summit. My heartfelt congratulations to HSBC for convening this distinguished gathering of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and local business leaders under the theme ""Connecting Growth Corridors – ASEAN and the Belt and Road"". This occasion exemplifies Hong Kong's pivotal role as a super connector, fostering open dialogue and forging partnerships to drive the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) forward.

 Since its inception in 2013, the BRI has been guided by the core principles of connectivity, openness, mutual respect, and shared prosperity. Over the past decade, its scope has expanded remarkably, fostering co-operation across continents through physical infrastructure, trade networks, and increasingly, technological collaboration. This dynamic evolution positions the BRI as a powerful platform for sustainable growth, with Hong Kong as a key contributor, facilitating seamless connections between Mainland China, ASEAN, and global markets. Our strategic location, robust financial systems and world-class professional services make Hong Kong the ideal hub for BRI-related investments and partnerships. In fact, we have signed Comprehensive Double Taxation Agreements with 37 Belt and Road jurisdictions, facilitating business expansion and investment.

 Hong Kong's financial markets are thriving, reflecting the confidence and resilience that underpin our role in the BRI. In the first eight months of this year, our stock market achieved an average daily turnover of US$31.9 billion, a 132 per cent increase over the same period of last year. Funds raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) soared to US$17.3 billion, up 579 per cent. These figures highlight Hong Kong's status as a premier global IPO hub, offering BRI enterprises unparalleled access to capital, underpinned by our rule of law, simple tax regime, and deep market connectivity. Earlier in August, a mining company rooted in Kazakhstan successfully listed on in our market, showcasing the results of co-operation between Hong Kong and Central Asia in advancing the BRI initiative. This also marks the Central Asia's first case of an IPO financed in RMB (Renminbi).

 Besides the stellar performance of our stock market, we have also proudly launched a company redomiciliation regime this year, and some leading international insurance companies have already taken advantage of that. This initiative provides a secure and efficient pathway for overseas companies to redomicile to Hong Kong, enabling them to leverage our financial ecosystem to support more expansion initiatives including BRI projects. With the Companies Registry's efficient approval process and our collaboration with offshore jurisdictions to streamline deregistration, we invite businesses to make Hong Kong their strategic base for navigating global uncertainties and driving BRI growth.

 And on the risk management front, Hong Kong is solidifying its position as Asia's leading insurance hub, critical for BRI enterprises managing complex cross-border projects. With some 160 authorised insurers and last year's gross premiums of HK$637.8 billion, Hong Kong ranks first in Asia for insurance density and globally for penetration at 18.2 per cent. Captive insurance, offering tailored risk solutions, is gaining momentum, with new entrants like HSBC bringing our total to six captive insurers. Our incentives, including a 50 per cent profits tax reduction, simplified capital requirements and a robust pool of insurance professionals, make Hong Kong the ideal base for managing BRI-related risks, from infrastructure to cybersecurity.

 Looking ahead, Hong Kong is committed to deepening BRI co-operation. Through initiatives like mutual market access with the Greater Bay Area, proactive outreach to global enterprises, and promotion of our insurance and financial strengths, we are empowering ASEAN and BRI partners to seize opportunities, manage risks, and achieve shared prosperity.

 In closing, I commend HSBC for hosting this platform to strengthen ties and drive collaboration. Let us harness Hong Kong's unique advantages to advance the Belt and Road Initiative, connecting growth corridors and building a sustainable future together. Thank you, and I wish you a productive and inspiring luncheon."

Speech by FS at Biotechnology Investment Forum of BIOHK2025 (English only) (with photos),2025-09-11 12:03,2025-09-11 12:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202509/11/P2025091100350.htm,"  Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Biotechnology Investment Forum of BIOHK2025 today (September 11):

Albert (Chairman of the Hong Kong Biotechnology Organization and President of BIOHK2025, Professor Albert Yu), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the opening of the Biotechnology Investment Forum, here on Day 2 of BIOHK 2025. A warm welcome to all participants joining us from Hong Kong, the Chinese Mainland and around the world.

This Forum brings together a global community of pioneers, including scientists, entrepreneurs, investors and policymakers, who are leading the way in biotech development. It offers a valuable platform to exchange insights, foster collaboration, and explore opportunities to drive the next wave of growth in this rapidly evolving sector.

We meet at a time of rapid advancement in biotechnology, especially as it converges with artificial intelligence. Yet alongside advances and breakthroughs, the sector is grappling with a number of critical issues. How can we accelerate R&D (research and development) efficiency and clinical translation? How do we strengthen supply chain resilience and overcome technological barriers? How can we ensure access and inclusivity in biomedicine? And how do we equip biomed talent in an AI-driven world?

At the same time, the rise of China as a biotechnology leader is reshaping the global innovation landscape. The Mainland is now the world's second-largest biopharmaceutical market. Its biotech enterprises account for nearly 30 per cent of global innovative drug assets, up from just 10 per cent in 2019. This remarkable shift reflects not only our country's growing capability and capacity, but also its long-term strategic commitment and sustained investment in the sector.

In this context, there is no better place than Hong Kong to host this important discussion. Our city welcomes ideas, talent and capital from around the world. We serve as a gateway to the fast-expanding Mainland market, and as a launch pad for Mainland innovations to go global.

Indeed, under the ""one country, two systems"" framework, Hong Kong enjoys the best of both worlds. We uphold the rule of law and continue to practise the common law system. With the free flow of capital, information and talent, Hong Kong remains deeply connected to the international community. Our intellectual property protections align with the best international standards, and our financial institutions and professional services are world-class. These qualities make Hong Kong a reliable and trusted partner for technology development and investment.

More specifically, allow me to highlight four key areas where Hong Kong can make a difference for global biotech development.

A dynamic I&T ecosystem

First, our innovation and technology (I&T) ecosystem is growing in depth and breadth. It supports the full biotech value chain, from upstream research and product design to downstream commercialisation and market expansion.

At the upstream level, Hong Kong's universities are world leading. Five of them rank among the world’s top 100, with two medical schools among the global top 25. We have also established 14 dedicated healthcare research centres led by eminent academic and clinical researchers. Their work spans genomics, regenerative medicine, organoid models, cell therapy and beyond.

In the midstream, we are stepping up efforts to translate research into real-world applications. Government schemes such as the RAISe+ Programme are helping to bridge the gap between laboratories and market, facilitating the growth of new biotech ventures.

Downstream, we are nurturing targeted industries where Hong Kong holds strategic advantages, in particular biotech and AI. Today, Hong Kong is home to over 4 700 start-ups and nearly 20 unicorns, many of which are nurtured and supported by the Hong Kong Science Park and Cyberport. 

We continue to attract strategic enterprises from around the world. Over the past two years, more than 80 such enterprises have established a presence in Hong Kong, investing over US$6.5 billion and creating some 20 000 quality jobs. A new batch of enterprises, including several world-leading pharmaceutical companies, will soon join their ranks.

One of Hong Kong's unique advantages is its role as a convergence point for international and Mainland data. This is particularly valuable for biotech enterprises engaged in clinical trials as well as drug discovery and development.

Artificial intelligence is central to the next wave of biotech innovation. Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry and a key enabler to transform other sectors. We are building our AI capabilities across five pillars: data, algorithms, computing power, capital and talent. In Hong Kong, a number of homegrown start-ups and foreign enterprises are actively engaged in AI-driven drug discovery, diagnostic tools and personalised medicine.

Access to capital

Second, Hong Kong offers biotech firms access to deep and diversified capital pools.

Our stock market is a prime example. In the first seven months of 2025, US$16 billion was raised through IPOs (initial public offerings) in Hong Kong, a six-fold increase compared to the same period last year. The biotech sector was a key beneficiary, with 15 IPOs raising nearly US$3 billion. The Hang Seng Biotech Index has surged more than 85 per cent, outperforming regional and global peers.

This growth builds on our capital market reforms. In 2018, we introduced a listing regime for pre-revenue biotech companies and companies with weighted voting rights structures. These reforms have transformed the Hong Kong stock market.

As of July, more than 75 biotech firms had listed under the reformed regime, raising over US$30 billion. This makes Hong Kong the second-largest biotech fundraising centre globally.

We are also enhancing our listing process. In line with this year's Budget, a dedicated channel for technology enterprises has been launched to provide tailored support to biotech and deep-tech firms preparing for IPOs. This initiative helps companies navigate the process with greater clarity and confidence.

Beyond public markets, we offer a robust private capital ecosystem. Hong Kong is home to over 650 private equity and venture capital firms, with US$230 billion in assets under management, second only to the Chinese Mainland in Asia.

We understand that some of the most cutting-edge biotech segments - such as novel proteins, frontier diagnostics and surgical robotics - require long-term investment. This is where patient capital comes into play. The Hong Kong Investment Corporation (HKIC), which was established in 2022 with US$8 billion initial capital, invests and co-invests in biotech and hardtech companies, among others. To date, it has deployed about 20 per cent of its invested capital in biotech projects.

The HKIC also plays a crucial role in connecting Hong Kong and Mainland innovations with global capital, enabling cross-border partnerships and supporting their effort to go global.

Supportive Government policies

Third, Hong Kong's policy and regulatory environment is supportive of biotech innovation.

In addition to the finance side mentioned earlier, we are working to establish a primary evaluation mechanism for drug approvals. This will allow Hong Kong to independently review and approve medical products and devices, aligning them with international standards and accelerating their time to the market.

To this end, we are establishing the Hong Kong Centre for Medical Products Regulation. We have joined the International Council for Harmonisation as an observer and are investing in the needed infrastructure, systems and talent to support this transition. Our target is to begin phased implementation of the new framework in 2026, with full rollout by 2030.

This initiative will enhance Hong Kong's role as a base for R&D, clinical trials and regional co-operation. Indeed, for international pharmaceutical firms, approval in Hong Kong may serve as a strategic pathway to get faster access to the Mainland market, especially within the Greater Bay Area (GBA).

Our collaboration across the GBA continues to deepen. With 87 million residents, the GBA is a vast market for health products and a key resource for clinical research. In the Hetao Innovation and Technology Park, also known as the Loop Area, Hong Kong and Shenzhen have established cross-boundary clinical trial institutions that support studies complying with the standards and requirements of both jurisdictions.

We are also working to enable the seamless flow of data, capital, talent and other factors of production with Shenzhen in the Hetao area, creating an innovation corridor for biotech and pharmaceutical companies.

Welcoming global talent

Finally, talent is a cornerstone of our biotech strategy. Since late 2022, Hong Kong has received over 510 000 applications under various talent admission schemes, with more than 340 000 approvals and nearly 230 000 arrivals to date. And under one of the schemes - the Top Talent Pass Scheme, around 20 per cent of the talent are engaged in innovation and technology.

We continue to attract top researchers, scientists and professionals from around the world. There is a growing number of ethnic Chinese scientists looking to Hong Kong as a globally connected and friendly base to work.

Closing

Ladies and gentlemen, the opportunities in biotechnology are enormous. With our institutional strengths, deep financial resources, research excellence, supportive government policies and world-class talent, Hong Kong has what it takes to shine in the next wave of biotech breakthroughs.

Whether you are an innovator seeking capital, an investor looking for promising projects, or an organisation seeking biotech solutions - Hong Kong welcomes you.

Let us work together to turn today's ideas into tomorrow's innovations.

Thank you, and I wish you all a successful and rewarding Forum."
