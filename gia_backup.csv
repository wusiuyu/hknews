Speech by SCED at plenary session of APEC Ministerial Meeting (1) (English only),2025-10-30 12:22,2025-10-30 12:30,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000281.htm," Following is the speech by the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development, Mr Algernon Yau, at the plenary session themed ""Innovate and Prosper"" at the 36th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting in Gyeongju, Korea, today (October 30):

 Thank you, Chair.

 On behalf of the Hong Kong, China (HKC) delegation, let me begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Korea for the warm hospitality and for hosting us in this historic and beautiful city of Gyeongju.

 The rapid development of digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), is fundamentally changing our societies at an unprecedented pace. To fully harness the benefits and smoothen the transformation process, HKC strongly supports deepening APEC's digital co-operation to foster economic growth and address common challenges. To this end, I would like to offer three suggestions.

 First, we must provide an enabling environment for digital innovation to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. This calls for strengthening infrastructure and adopting an application-oriented approach to promote deep integration of AI across the economy. HKC has been taking concrete actions. In terms of infrastructure, apart from the Cyberport's AI Supercomputing Centre established last year, we will develop an additional high-performing data facility cluster to provide advanced computing power for innovation. To promote AI adoption, we are attempting regulatory innovations like the AI sandbox for financial institutions, accelerating the digital transformation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and upgrading our trade architecture with AI. Our Government is also leading by example. As announced by our Chief Executive in his Policy Address last month, we are forming an AI Efficacy Enhancement Team to drive technological reform and modernise workflows across government agencies.

 Second, we must ensure that the benefits of digital advancement are shared across all sectors. With a people-centred approach, HKC is tackling key challenges such as digital divides and job displacements that are impeding an inclusive digital transition. Besides developing a strategic blueprint that will incorporate AI literacy into the core curriculum and enhance teacher training to ensure our next generation is future-ready, we are also reforming retraining programmes and strengthening re-employment support for our current workforce.

 Third, we should leverage APEC's unique role as an incubator of ideas to advance digital co-operation. Over the past decade, APEC has made significant strides in its digital agenda, from the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap to the APEC AI Initiative this year. We particularly commend Korea's leadership in mainstreaming AI across APEC's agenda, effectively connecting it to both traditional and emerging issues such as trade, demographic changes as well as cultural and creative industries. HKC is pleased to endorse these efforts and will continue to actively contribute to APEC's co-operation.

 In closing, HKC recognises AI as a key enabler to realise the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040. We look forward to working together with fellow member economies to leverage digital co-operation and build a vibrant digital ecosystem across the Asia-Pacific region for the prosperity of our people and future generations. Thank you."

Professor Guo (Provost of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Guo Yike), Professor Qu (Dean of Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Huamin Qu), Professor Song (Director of the Media Intelligence Research Center, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Professor Celine Song), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

  Good morning. It is my pleasure to join this forum, which brings together visionary minds to explore how trust, governance and innovation can shape the future of artificial intelligence. Let me begin by extending my warmest congratulations on the inauguration of the Media Intelligence Research Center of the HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology).

  First of all, I am happy to share with you that the National 15th Five-Year Plan has just confirmed the support for Hong Kong in building an international I&T (innovation and technology) centre. We are standing at the forefront of a global technological shift. AI is rapidly reshaping industries, economies and societies. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the global AI market is expected to reach about US$4.8 trillion by 2033, which is a 25-fold increase in 10 years from now. This remarkable growth underscores the urgent need for economies around the world to formulate and implement policies that balance the immense potential and the underlying risks of AI, ensuring its sustainable and inclusive development.

  The Government has spared no effort in promoting sound AI governance while fostering the advancement of industry. One of the cornerstones is the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Framework, first introduced in 2021, which covers 12 core principles from fairness and transparency to human oversight, implementation guidelines and risk assessment tools. The aim is to help organisations embed ethical considerations when implementing IT projects, ensuring that their AI systems are not only effective but also responsible. To keep up with the evolving AI landscape, the updated version introduced in 2023 further sharpened its relevance and recommended clearer practices to address emerging risks.

  Complementing our ethical framework is the Principles of Data Governance promulgated by the Government in 2024, which provide a foundational layer for reliable AI development. As data powers every stage of the life cycle of an AI system, from training to application, its quality, integrity and responsible use are essential. This Data Governance document promotes lawful sharing, privacy protection and accountability, helping organisations unlock the value of data in a responsible and ethical manner. This is crucial to our broader governance efforts.

  In view of the growing use of generative AI across sectors, the Government sees the merits in developing a practical framework for safe and responsible adoption that is tailored to Hong Kong's context with contribution from professionals. The Hong Kong Generative AI Research and Development Center (HKGAI), under the leadership of Professor Guo Yike, was commissioned to put together the Hong Kong Generative Artificial Intelligence Technical and Application Guideline for release in April 2025. By leveraging the HKGAI's experience in building Hong Kong's first locally adapted large language model, the guideline provides clear, pragmatic and actionable advice for developers, service providers and users in the application of AI technology, covering key risks of data leakage, model bias and misinformation, and recommendations on safeguarding model training, deployment and content integrity.

  The Government also takes the lead in building a vibrant AI ecosystem by advancing the integration of AI into public services, recognising its potential to enhance efficiency, responsiveness and citizen experience. As announced in the 2025 Policy Address, a dedicated AI Efficacy Enhancement Team is set up to promote AI applications across government departments and explore process re-engineering to elevate public services. In parallel, the Digital Policy Office will roll out various AI applications in respect of data analysis, customer service and document processing.

  Alongside various initiatives to expand AI application scenarios in public services, the Government introduced the AI Adoption Guide for Government bureaux and departments earlier this year. It outlines strategies, practical guidelines and facilitation measures for AI adoption, with a strong emphasis on top-down leadership and a business-led ""AI+"" approach. It further encourages departments to identify operational challenges and explore the deployment of AI to enhance efficiency and improve service quality, serving as a catalyst for public service transformation.

  A thriving AI ecosystem counts not only on innovation and technology, but also strong and adaptive governance. Compliance across both public and private sectors is vital to protect data, uphold standards and build public trust. I appreciate the cross-sectoral effort in promoting responsible innovation and reliable AI governance.

  Before I close, I wish this forum every success, and look forward to witnessing Hong Kong's AI development scaling new heights. Thank you."

  The TD welcomes interested organisations or enterprises to submit applications for a pilot licence. Upon receipt of an application, the TD will consider various factors, including the design operating range and functions of the autonomous system, relevant national or international standards/guidelines, and the road test situations, based on the Code of Practice for Trial and Pilot Use of Autonomous Vehicles before approval. Among them, the TD has been accepting submissions of the Guobiao (GB) to substantiate that the vehicles or their components comply with the relevant technical requirements and vehicle construction standards. In addition, the operation experience and performance of AV in areas outside Hong Kong (including the Mainland), such as test reports in accordance with the GB, will be taken into consideration by the TD in evaluating the performance of the vehicle automation.

  The Policy Address 2025 set out the promotion of AVs. The Government will continue to facilitate the industry to conduct AV trials and applications across various communities, aiming to accelerate progress towards driverless and large-scale development. The Government also aspires to achieve commercial operation, encouraging the industry to leverage Hong Kong as a platform to explore overseas markets, particularly those with right-hand drive systems. Driving and road safety remain the top priority, and the Government will draw on practical experience to refine technical standards, share research findings with the industry in a timely manner, and implement these initiatives in a prudent and orderly process."
財經事務及庫務局局長在2025年金融街論壇年會「京港聯動　共贏未來」平行論壇致辭全文（只有中文）,2025-10-30 11:15,2025-10-30 11:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000264.htm,"以下是財經事務及庫務局局長許正宇今日（十月三十日）在2025年金融街論壇年會「京港聯動共贏未來」平行論壇的致辭全文：

尊敬的孫巿長（北京巿政府副巿長孫碩）、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們，

大家好！很榮幸在2025年金融街論壇年會「京港聯動 共贏未來」平行論壇上發言，與來自全球的業界領袖共同探討「創新、變革、重塑下的全球金融發展」。我謹代表香港特別行政區政府，感謝主辦方提供這一重要平台，讓我們共商京港金融合作，助力國家高質量發展。

當前，全球經濟正處於變革與重塑的關鍵時期，金融業作為科技與產業融合的橋樑，承載着推動創新、提升效率的重要使命。北京作為國家的金融管理中心，是國家多個重要金融監管機構的所在地、同時匯聚眾多龍頭企業總部，是政策與創新的核心；香港則作為國際金融中心，在最新《全球金融中心指數》中穩居全球第三、亞洲第一，憑藉在「一國兩制」下擁有背靠祖國、聯通世界的獨特優勢：資金、人才、資訊、數據自由流通，實施普通法制度，成為聯繫國內外市場的理想平台。京港兩地優勢互補，合作潛力無限，將共同為國家金融開放和「一帶一路」建設注入新動力。

京港協同，服務實體經濟

國家強調金融服務實體經濟，加快構建現代化金融市場體系，並持續推進金融業對外開放。京港在這一進程中擁有廣闊合作空間。香港作為國家和國際雙循環重要交匯點，將充分發揮資本市場優勢，為北京企業「走出去」提供支持，促進新質生產力發展，推動高質量經濟增長。

香港作為全球領先的集資中心，為北京企業開拓國際及「一帶一路」市場提供重要平台。截至上月底，接近230家北京企業在港上市，總市值近13萬億港元，佔香港股票市場市值大概四分之一左右，累計融資超過3萬億港元。北京企業來港上市，既滿足了自身的融資需要，同時也推動香港資本市場的發展，讓投資者有更多優質的投資選擇，也讓兩地互惠的金融合作開創了新局面。

為適應新經濟企業需求，港交所（香港交易及結算所有限公司）持續優化上市制度。二○二三年三月推出的專精特新企業上市機制，便利新一代訊息技術、先進硬件及軟件、先進材料、新能源等科技企業上市。繼生物科技企業上市改革成功後，進一步為國家創新企業提供國際資本渠道，配合支持專精特新企業的國家政策。同時，庫存股份機制、IPO（首次公開招股）審批流程優化及新股定價機制改革，提升了香港資本市場的包容性與國際競爭力。

企業財資與財富管理

香港為北京企業提供先進的企業財資及財富管理服務，這是融資以外的另一重點。合資格企業財資中心享有利得稅減半優惠，吸引不少總部位於北京的內地企業在港設立財資中心，管理現金、融資、外匯及對沖業務，降低財務成本。自稅務優惠計劃推出以來，香港金融管理局已與約850間企業接觸，逾140間企業，當中包括40多間總部位於北京的企業，計劃或已在港設立財資中心。我們正研究優化稅務寬減，預計二○二六年上半年完成。

在財富管理方面，香港可以為內地企業及個人投資者提供全面的服務。截至去年底，香港管理超過35萬億港元資產，其中百分之六十四來自非香港投資者。另一方面，內地與香港基金互認安排認可82個基金，截至今年七月銷售淨額超過1,100億元人民幣。北京企業可利用香港的開放式基金型公司、有限合夥基金及房地產投資信託基金融資及拓展全球業務。香港的家族辦公室生態亦支持財富管理與傳承，我們正推動一系列政策，讓家族辦公室和資產擁有人在香港蓬勃發展。

風險管理與保險

金融除了融資、財富管理，風險管理也是其中非常重要的一環。香港作為環球保險樞紐，為北京企業提供多元化風險管理方案。北京的保險公司分出業務予合資格的香港專業再保險公司，可享有資本要求優待。

在應對天然災害及氣候變化風險方面，我們推出了專屬監管制度和資助計劃，便利包括巨災債券在內的保險相連證券在港發行。自二○二一年起，香港促成七宗巨災債券發行，有效把保險風險透過證券化轉移到資本市場，總額近八億美元。此外，保險相連證券資助先導計劃延長至二○二八年，補貼前期費用降低發行成本，持續推動更多相關證券發行。

我們亦鼓勵內地企業在港設立專屬自保保險公司（自保公司），內地十家自保公司中，六家在香港成立，包括中海油、中石化及中廣核等國企，體現香港作為自保保險中心的吸引力。

結語

各位嘉賓、各位朋友，京港兩地的金融合作前景非常廣闊、機遇無限。香港將繼續發揮「超級聯繫人」和「超級增值人」的角色，以自身所長服務國家所需，助力國家「走出去」和「引進來」戰略的實施。我們相信，通過京港彼此兩地的緊密合作、優勢互補、資源共享，作為國家的金融管理中心和國際金融中心，必將為兩地金融業的高質量發展注入新的動力。謝謝大家！"
"Five property owners fined over $500,000 in total for not complying with removal orders",2025-10-30 11:00,2025-10-30 11:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000226.htm,"Five owners were convicted and fined $510,190 in total at the Magistrates' Courts on Tuesday (October 28) for failing to comply with removal orders issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).

 The first case involved three unauthorised structures with a total area of about 75 square metres on a flat roof and rooftop of a residential building on San Lok Street, Sheung Shui. As the unauthorised building works (UBWs) were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), three removal orders were served on the two concerned owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal orders, they were prosecuted by the BD and were fined $317,710 in total, of which $222,710 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts.

 The second case involved a three-storey unauthorised structure with an area of about 100 sq m at Sheung Wo Hang, Sha Tau Kok. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the UBWs and they were also carried out without prior approval and consent from the BD, a removal order was served on the two co-owners under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, they were prosecuted by the BD and were fined $104,280 in total, of which $84,280 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Fanling Magistrates' Courts.

 The third case involved unauthorised alterations at the basement of an industrial building at Kwun Tong Road, Kwun Tong, including erection of a structure at the entrance of a staircase, replacement of fire-resisting concrete block walls by glazed walls of an inadequate fire rating and removal of fire-resisting concrete block walls and fire-resisting doors at cold-storage godowns. The alteration works affected the fire-resisting construction of the building and contravened the Building (Construction) Regulation. A removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD and was fined $88,200 in total, of which $53,200 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, upon conviction at the Kwun Tong Magistrates' Courts.

 A spokesman for the BD said today (October 30), ""UBWs, including unauthorised alterations affecting the fire-resisting construction of a building, may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety.""

 Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues."

陳茂波早上在未來投資倡議大會中，出席了由滙豐舉辦的早餐會，並在其爐邊對談環節分享了對香港和中東深化經貿金融關係的展望。

陳茂波指出，在全球地緣經貿格局日趨碎片化的背景下，中國及其他亞洲地區與中東地區的經貿金融關係正持續深化。香港將進一步發揮國際金融中心和國際一流專業服務的獨特優勢，積極助力內地企業「走出去」，佈局產業鏈和供應鏈，以及拓展海外市場；同時，亦為有意進軍內地和亞洲市場的中東企業提供資金和專業服務等支持。此外，憑藉高度國際化的金融體系、多元化的資金渠道，以及創新的融資方案，香港可進一步推動兩地的資金跨境流動，及以基建貸款證券化等創新模式，為基建投資提供靈活多元的融資方案。

陳茂波也表示，香港正加速推動與中東之間的跨境金融與創科產業合作，包括資本市場的互聯互通，例如互掛交易所買賣基金（ETF），以及鼓勵中東企業來港上市。另外在創科方面，香港以及粵港澳大灣區的初創和科技企業亦有不少已落戶中東發展業務。在回答提問時，陳茂波表示香港正加大力度發展人工智能，包括發展人工智能為核心產業，並以人工智能賦能各行各業升級轉型；政府亦帶頭應用人工智能提升效率和服務質素。

陳茂波其後帶同代表團前往沙特國家銀行（Saudi National Bank）訪問，與銀行的高層管理人員座談交流。該銀行是當地規模最大的國有商業銀行。香港代表團成員分別介紹其業務，並表示希望與沙特當地的金融機構、投資者和企業對接，以進入中東市場。陳茂波作總結發言時表示，香港正積極促進與沙特之間雙向的投資和資金流動，特別是支持香港和內地企業在中東投資興業，期望雙方加強合作，拓展更大商機。

下午，陳茂波率領代表團前往數字合作組織（Digital Cooperation Organization）總部，與該組織總幹事Hajar El Haddaoui博士會面。數字合作組織是一個多邊國際組織，總部設於沙特阿拉伯利雅得，旨在促進成員國之間在數字經濟領域的合作與協同發展。該組織目前涵蓋來自中東、亞洲、非洲等多個地區的16個成員國，以及39個來自區外的國家、國際組織和商業機構等的觀察員，其核心任務包括提升數字基礎設施、促進普惠包容的科技創新、加強青年與婦女在科技領域的參與，以及建立有利於數字企業發展的國際合作平台。

會上，代表團成員介紹了其業務重點和未來發展方向。數字合作組織非常歡迎代表團的到訪，並表示希望推動組織成員國的初創和創科企業與代表團加強交流，促進兩地的創科與產業合作。

代表團亦前往阿卜杜勒阿齊茲國王科技城（King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology）旗下的創科孵化平台「The Garage」參訪，深入了解其運作，以及當地政府在培育初創企業方面的政策。雙方亦探討了企業孵化、人才交流及科研等領域的合作。

FS continues to lead delegation to visit Saudi Arabia (with photos/video),2025-10-30 09:00,2025-10-30 09:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/30/P2025103000040.htm,"âThe Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, continued his official visit to Saudi Arabia yesterday (October 29, Riyadh time), leading a delegation to participate in activities of the Future Investment Initiative (FII). During the visit, Mr Chan engaged in in-depth exchanges with local political and business leaders, and visited local innovation and technology institutions, as well as urban planning and conservation projects.

In the morning, Mr Chan attended a breakfast session hosted by HSBC at the FII and took part in a fireside chat, during which he shared his insights on the prospects for strengthening economic, trade and financial ties between Hong Kong and the Middle East.

Mr Chan noted that against the backdrop of increasing global geopolitical and economic fragmentation, economic and financial links between China as well as other parts of Asia and the Middle East continue to deepen. Hong Kong will further leverage its role as an international financial centre and provider of world-class professional services to support Mainland enterprises in going global, expanding their industrial and supply chains, and tapping into overseas markets. At the same time, Hong Kong stands ready to offer capital and professional services to Middle Eastern businesses seeking to enter the Mainland and Asian markets. Furthermore, with its highly internationalised financial system, diversified financing channels, and innovative financial solutions, Hong Kong is well placed to promote cross-border capital flows as well as provide diversified and flexible infrastructure financing models, such as infrastructure loan securitisation.

Mr Chan added that Hong Kong is accelerating cross-border financial and innovation and technology collaboration with the Middle East. This includes enhancing capital market connectivity, such as mutual listing of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and encouraging Middle Eastern businesses to list in Hong Kong. In terms of innovation and technology, a number of start-ups and tech companies from Hong Kong and the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area have already established a presence in the Middle East. In response to questions, Mr Chan said Hong Kong is stepping up efforts to develop artificial intelligence (AI), both as a core industry and as an enabler to help upgrade and transform various sectors. The Government is also taking the lead in adopting AI to enhance efficiency and service quality.

Later in the day, Mr Chan and the delegation visited the Saudi National Bank, the largest state-owned commercial bank in the country, and attended a meeting with its senior management. Members of the Hong Kong delegation introduced their respective businesses and conveyed interest in connecting with financial institutions, investors and enterprises in Saudi Arabia in order to explore opportunities in the Middle Eastern market. In the concluding remarks, Mr Chan highlighted Hong Kong's active role in fostering two-way investment and capital flows with Saudi Arabia, particularly in supporting Hong Kong and Chinese Mainland enterprises to invest and establish businesses in the region. He expressed the hope that both sides would enhance co-operation and seize greater business opportunities.

In the afternoon, the delegation visited the headquarters of the Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) and met with its Director-General, Dr Hajar El Haddaoui. The DCO is a multilateral international organisation based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, aimed at fostering co-operation and coordinated development among member states in the digital economy. Currently comprising 16 member countries from the Middle East, Asia and Africa, and 39 observers including non-regional countries, international organisations and business entities, the DCO's core objectives include enhancing digital infrastructure, promoting inclusive and innovative technology, increasing youth and women participation in technology, and establishing international co-operation platforms conducive to the growth of digital enterprises.

During the meeting, members of the delegation outlined their core business areas and future development directions. The DCO warmly welcomed the delegation and expressed interest in facilitating greater exchanges between start-ups and innovation enterprises from its member states and the Hong Kong delegation, with a view to promoting innovation and industrial co-operation between the two sides.

The delegation also visited The Garage, an innovation and technology incubation platform under the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, to gain a deeper understanding of its operations and the local government's policies in nurturing start-ups. Both sides discussed potential collaboration in areas such as incubation, talent exchanges and scientific research.

Subsequently, the delegation visited Diriyah and visited the At-Turaif, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They also learnt more about the Diriyah Gate Project, a major urban revitalisation initiative. The visit provided insights into local strategies and latest developments in heritage conservation, city planning and the diversification of the tourism sector.

In the evening, Mr Chan attended a welcome dinner hosted by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade for Chinese and Saudi business communities.

Mr Chan will continue his visit in Riyadh today (October 30, Riyadh time) before concluding the trip and returning to Hong Kong."

香港金融管理局今日（十月三十日）宣布，基本利率根據預設公式定於4.25厘，即時生效。

因應美國於十月二十九日（美國時間）調低聯邦基金利率的目標區間25基點，當前的美國聯邦基金利率目標區間的下限加50基點是4.25%，而隔夜及一個月香港銀行同業拆息的五天移動平均數的平均值是3.21%，所以根據預設公式，基本利率設定於4.25%。"

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced today (October 30) that the Base Rate has been set at 4.25 per cent with immediate effect according to a pre-set formula.

The Base Rate is the interest rate forming the foundation upon which the Discount Rates for repurchase transactions through the Discount Window are computed. The Base Rate is currently set at either 50 basis points above the lower end of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBORs), whichever is the higher.

Following the 25-basis point downward adjustment in the target range for the US federal funds rate on October 29 (US time), 50 basis points above the lower end of the prevailing target range for the US federal funds rate is 4.25 per cent, while the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month HIBORs is 3.21 per cent. The Base Rate is therefore set at 4.25 per cent according to the pre-set formula."

They were suspected of committing offences contravening the Public Order Ordinance (Cap 245), for “aiding and abetting riot”, “incitement to riot” and “conspiracy to incite riot”, as well as the offence of “sedition” under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance. They were also suspected of “perverting the course of public justice”.

 Police investigations revealed that the arrested persons were suspected of manufacturing and providing weapons for frontline rioters who participated in multiple riots in late 2019, with the intention of causing serious casualties. One of the arrested men, aged 34, was also suspected of repeatedly posting seditious posts on his social media platform, which included inciting hatred against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and encouraging unlawful behavior. Another arrested woman, aged 50, was suspected of “perverting the course of public justice” by attempting to assist one of the arrested men in removing evidence related to the case.

 During the operation, a total of about $250,000 in cash was seized, believed to be related to the case. The arrested persons are being detained for further enquires. Police operation is ongoing.

 Police stressed that anyone participating in or supporting acts that undermine public peace and endanger national security is committing a serious offence. The maximum penalties for offences of “rioting” and “sedition” upon conviction are 10 years and seven years of imprisonment respectively. Police will continue to uphold the principle of “laws are observed and strictly enforced, to bring offenders to account” and will take resolute enforcement actions."

基孔肯雅熱最新情況,2025-10-29 18:51,2025-10-29 19:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102900621.htm,"​衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）表示，截至今日（十月二十九日）下午五時，中心錄得兩宗新增感染基孔肯雅熱個案，為輸入個案。

最新個案資料
——————

首宗個案涉及一名35歲女子，住所位於東區。初步調查顯示，她於十月十九日至二十四日到訪印度尼西亞峇里。她於十月二十二日出現皮疹，翌日（十月二十三日）出現關節痛及發燒，並於十月二十七日向私家醫生求診，昨日（十月二十八日）入住東區尤德夫人那打素醫院在無蚊環境下接受治療。病人的一名家居接觸者及與病人同行到峇里的人士，暫時沒有出現病徵，正接受醫學監察。

另一宗個案涉及一名69歲男子，獨居於觀塘區。初步調查顯示，他於十月二十一日至二十六日獨自到訪廣東省中山市。他於十月二十六日出現發燒及關節痛，昨日入住基督教聯合醫院在無蚊環境下接受治療。

兩名病人的血液樣本對基孔肯雅病毒呈陽性反應，目前情況穩定。由於兩名病人在潛伏期曾分別到訪印度尼西亞及廣東省，中心認為他們是在外遊期間受到感染，屬輸入個案。中心會繼續進行流行病學調查，並會把個案通報相關衞生部門。

最新監測數據
———————

就日前確診基孔肯雅熱但感染源頭有待確定的55歲女子，病毒基因分析工作仍在進行。

本港今年累計錄得52宗基孔肯雅熱確診個案。撇除上述個案，一宗屬本地個案，50宗屬輸入個案。

此外，由十月二十六日至今日下午五時，中心已透過設於鳳德商場二樓的醫護站及熱線電話為約3 300名居民作評估，當中發現31名出現輕微病徵的市民，中心已安排他們接受抽血檢查，化驗工作正陸續進行，暫時已完成檢驗的樣本全部對基孔肯雅病毒呈陰性。

自二○二五年初至九月三十日，全球40個國家／地區呈報了445 271宗基孔肯雅熱病例及155宗相關死亡個案。個案分布在美洲、非洲、亞洲及歐洲。現時全球多國正爆發基孔肯雅熱，市民外遊前必須注意當地情況。

政府繼續全方位防控基孔肯雅熱
——————————————

中心正繼續聯同政府多個部門和相關機構採取適當防控措施，全力預防基孔肯雅熱在本地扎根和減低疾病對本港公共衞生的影響。

中心明日（十月三十日）晚上八時三十分會舉行第二場網上講座，由醫生講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況、如何預防受感染、如何正確使用昆蟲驅避劑等。

中心人員和當區關愛隊已向當區約八千戶民居派發問卷及宣傳單張，並會繼續聯絡居民發放資訊，了解及跟進他們的健康情況。中心亦已發信給醫生、醫院、學校及院舍，講解基孔肯雅熱的最新情況，並提醒他們提高警覺。

另外，中心由十月二十六日起設立熱線（電話：2125 2373）及上述的醫護站，每日由上午九時至下午八時運作，為出現相關症狀的居民作評估和解答市民有關基孔肯雅熱的查詢。

食環署聯同相關部門自今年七月起已在全港各區全面加強控蚊工作，至今一直持續。其中，食環署已對早前所有輸入個案進行病媒調查及針對性滅蚊工作。因應出現本地個案，食環署已立即採取跟進行動，包括：

• 在相關地點附近250米範圍內樹木茂密的地點進行密集式霧化處理工作，以殺滅成蚊；
• 巡查上述地點，清理積水，施放殺蟲劑及清除遺棄的水載容器，以防止蚊子滋生；及
• 加強宣傳教育，包括舉辦健康講座、設置流動教育中心及派發宣傳單張等。

上述措施會持續進行。此外，政府會在現有強化措施的基礎上，進一步加強全港控蚊工作。

市民應採取的防預措施
——————————

由基孔肯雅熱所引致的嚴重症狀及死亡十分罕見，死亡率少於千分之一，出現嚴重併發症大多與病人的自身健康情況有關。長者（特別是65歲以上）、幼童（特別是一歲以下的嬰兒）、懷孕婦女及長期病患者（例如患有高血壓、糖尿病、心臟病等人士）感染基孔肯雅熱後，較大機會引起併發症，康復時間亦較長。因此，中心建議市民（特別是上述的高危組別）如到訪受基孔肯雅熱影響的地區後出現相關病徵，尤其是發燒、關節突然劇痛及出現皮疹，應盡快求醫。

市民應使用含避蚊胺或其他有效活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑可有效防蚊，但使用時應注意以下事項：

• 先仔細閱讀標籤說明；
• 在進入可能被蚊叮的範圍前使用；
• 塗在外露皮膚及衣服；
• 孕婦使用避蚊胺的濃度上限是30%，兒童則為10%（如前往蚊傳疾病流行的國家或地區而有機會被蚊叮咬，兩個月或以上的兒童可使用濃度上限為30%的避蚊胺）；
• 先塗防曬霜，再塗昆蟲驅避劑；
• 遵照標籤說明，只於有需要時重複使用；及
• 除了避蚊胺之外，市面上亦有含其他活性成分的昆蟲驅避劑，例如IR3535、埃卡瑞丁（亦稱派卡瑞丁）等。公眾使用任何昆蟲驅避劑時，應遵從產品標籤上的使用說明及注意事項。

食環署亦呼籲市民繼續提高警覺及攜手合作，及早於家居及其他環境採取防蚊及滅蚊措施，包括視察家居及附近環境、徹底清除可供蚊子滋生的地方、每周最少一次徹底更換花瓶的水及擦洗內壁並清倒盆栽墊碟的水、妥善棄置空罐和飯盒等容器。此外，食環署亦建議市民和物業管理公司，應保持溝渠暢通及填平凹陷的地面，以防積水，並每周最少一次以鹼性清潔劑擦洗溝渠和排水明渠，除去可能積聚的蚊卵。

市民如發現蚊患，應致電1823，亦可參閱以下專題網頁，了解詳情：衞生防護中心及旅遊健康服務基孔肯雅熱專頁、最新旅遊情報、使用昆蟲驅避劑的注意事項、中心Facebook專頁、Instagram帳戶及YouTube頻道，以及食環署防控蚊患專頁。"
Update on chikungunya fever,2025-10-29 18:51,2025-10-29 19:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102900622.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that as of 5pm today (October 29), the CHP has recorded two new cases of chikungunya fever (CF), both are imported cases.

Latest cases information
----------------------------

The first case involves a 35-year-old female living in Eastern District. A preliminary investigation revealed that she visited Bali of the Indonesia between October 19 and October 24. She developed rash since October 22, and joint pain and fever the next day (October 23). She sought medical attention at a private clinic on October 27, and was admitted to the Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital yesterday (October 28) for treatment in a mosquito-free environment. Her household contact and her travel companions to Bali are currently asymptomatic and under medical surveillance.

The second case involves a 69-year-old male living alone in Kwun Tong District. A preliminary investigation revealed that he visited Zhongshan of the Guangdong Province alone between October 21 and October 26. He has developed fever and joint pain since October 26, and was admitted to the United Christian Hospital yesterday for treatment in a mosquito-free environment.

Their blood samples tested positive for the chikungunya virus upon laboratory testing. They are now in stable condition. Since the two patients stayed in Indonesia and Guangdong Province respectively during their incubation period, the CHP considered that they were infected during travel. The cases were classified as imported. The CHP's epidemiological investigation is ongoing, and it will report the cases to the relevant health authorities.

Latest surveillance data
-------------------------------

Regarding the confirmed CF case involving a 55-year-old female with source of infection yet to be confirmed, the genome analysis is still under way.

 So far this year, Hong Kong has recorded a total of 52 confirmed CF cases. Excluding the abovementioned case, there are one local case and 50 imported cases.

In addition, from October 26 to 5pm today, the CHP has conducted assessment for about 3 300 residents through the health consultation booth at 2/F, Fung Tak Shopping Centre and inquiry hotline. Among them, 31 individuals were found to have mild symptoms and they have been arranged to undergo blood tests. Laboratory testing is continuing, so far those samples that have completed testing are all negative for chikungunya virus.

ããSince the beginning of 2025, and as of September 30, a total of 445 271 suspected and confirmed CF cases and 155 CF-related deaths have been reported in 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. CF outbreaks currently occur in many countries worldwide. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad.

Government's continuous comprehensive actions on prevention and control of CF
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CHP continued to implement various prevention and control measures together with various Government departments and relevant organisations, striving to prevent CF from taking root locally and minimise the public health impact of the disease in Hong Kong.

The CHP will hold the second online live seminar at 8.30pm tomorrow (October 30). Doctors will explain the latest situation of CF, how to prevent infection and how to properly use insect repellents.

The CHP officers and District Services & Community Care Teams have distributed questionnaires and promotional leaflets to about 8 000 households in the district, and will continue to contact the residents, disseminate information, and understand and follow up their health conditions. The CHP has also issued letters to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions, providing the latest information on CF and remaining them to be vigilant.

In addition, the CHP has set up an inquiry hotline (2125 2373) and the abovementioned health consultation booth. The hotline and health consultation booth will continue to operate from 9am to 8pm daily to provide assessment to residents with relevant symptoms and answer enquiries relating to CF.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July this year and it has been continued. Among which, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, these measures include:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


ããThe abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures taken by the public
----------------------------------------------

Severe symptoms and deaths caused by CF are extremely rare, with a mortality rate of less than one in 1 000. The occurrence of severe complications is mostly related to the patients' underlying health conditions. Elderly persons (particularly those aged 65 or above), young children (particularly infants under 1 year old), pregnant women and persons with chronic illnesses (such as hypertension, diabetes or heart disease) are at higher risk of developing complications after contracting CF and may require a longer recovery period. Therefore, members of the public (especially the abovementioned high-risk groups) are advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop relevant symptoms, particularly a fever, sudden severe joint pain and skin rash, after visiting areas affected by CF.

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (For children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


âThe FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

各位領導、各位嘉賓、女士們、先生們：

大家下午好。感謝珠海國際仲裁院、珠海市司法局及廣東省律師協會的邀請。雖然今日我未能親身出席交流會，但十分高興可以透過視頻參與其中。

香港的獨特優勢是背靠祖國、聯通世界。香港的仲裁體系，正好體現這一點。根據最新的國際調查，香港獲選為全球第二、亞太區第一受歡迎的仲裁地，充分證明香港獲國際社會高度認可和信賴。香港的《仲裁條例》採納《示範法》（《國際商事仲裁示範法》），與國際接軌，未來我們也會積極研究修訂條例，確保香港的仲裁法律框架與時並進，符合市場的最新需求。

同時，香港與內地多年來在仲裁領域深化合作，也是香港具備獨特優勢的原因。在法律機制對接方面，兩地落實了《仲裁保全安排》（《關於內地與香港特別行政區法院就仲裁程序相互協助保全的安排》）和《執行安排》（《關於內地與香港特別行政區相互執行仲裁裁決的安排》），法律協助貫穿整個仲裁程序，讓當事人可以申請跨境保全，以及跨境執行裁決，更好保障各方的合法利益。

律政司積極推進大灣區涉外法治建設，並樂意貢獻香港的力量，發揮香港獨特的優勢。我們很高興今年二月迎來了規則銜接方面的重大突破，就是「港資港法」與「港資港仲裁」措施的擴展，而珠海也是其中一個試點城市，可以同時適用這兩項措施。

措施的擴展為企業提供了更多選擇，更靈活和更國際化的法律保障，深受商界包括海外商會的歡迎。落地至今，措施已取得顯著成效，有深圳仲裁機構成功處理選擇「港仲裁」的相關案件。期待珠海國際仲裁院以及大灣區內其他持份者，與我們一道積極推廣「港資」措施的應用，我們也十分歡迎各位隨時向律政司反饋意見。

此外，律政司也積極推動建立並落實「灣區標準」，助力灣區建立多元糾紛解決機制。我們正全力爭取在今年年底制定大灣區仲裁員名冊，增強用家的信心。下一步，我們希望與區內法律部門共同推動設立大灣區商事調解及仲裁平台，凝聚區內仲調機構，共同推廣並採用「灣區標準」，促進灣區仲調服務協同發展。

今日的交流會匯聚灣區內業界的領航人物，為大家帶來實務分享，為灣區法治協同注入新動力、新思維。祝願今日交流會圓滿成功。謝謝。"

二○二七年三月一日起的每年牌照費詳見附件。
另須收取交通意外傷亡者援助基金徵款，現時每輛車一年徵款為114元，四個月徵款為38元。
四個月的牌照費為相關每年牌照費的35%，以及附加費30元。






在新牌費架構下，按現時登記電動私家車的類型分布，有99%車輛的額定功率屬第一、二及三層級，第四及五層級的電動私家車分別僅佔1%和0.1%。

四個月寬限期內續領車輛牌照的特別安排

現有電動私家車車主需注意，如車輛牌照於二○二六年二月二十八日或之前屆滿，而車主在今年十一月一日至明年二月二十八日期間遞交續領申請，會沿用現行牌費架構和水平。

如續領明年三月一日或之後屆滿的牌照，或於今年十一月一日或之後遞交首次發出或重新發出的車輛牌照申請，則須付新牌費。

為合資格傷殘人士提供電動私家車牌費寬減

政府會為擁有電動私家車的合資格傷殘人士提供牌費寬減，以符合社會共融的政策目標。如其名下電動私家車的額定功率不超過75千瓦，則無須付牌費；如超過75千瓦，牌費為其額定功率層級訂明的每年牌費，減去不超過75千瓦的電動私家車應繳的每年牌費。此安排適用於合資格傷殘人士續領於二○二六年三月一日或之後屆滿的車輛牌照，或今年十一月一日或之後遞交首次發出或重新發出的車輛牌照申請。

運輸署已去信汽車業界和相關車輛代理，提醒他們注意新牌費架構的實施安排；並已在轄下牌照事務處張貼告示，簡介上述安排。署方亦會透過「電子駕駛執照」流動應用程式和「牌證易」網上電子牌照平台（elicensingportal.td.gov.hk/login）發放新牌費架構的信息。

New licence fee for electric private cars to take effect from November 1,2025-10-29 16:30,2025-10-29 16:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102800336.htm,"  The Transport Department (TD) today (October 29) reminded members of the public that the new licence fee for electric private cars (e-PCs) will take effect from November 1 (Saturday). The new fee structure will apply to newly registered e-PCs while renewal of vehicle licences (VLs) for existing ones will be granted a four-month grace period. Eligible disabled vehicle owners will be offered licence fee concessions.

  A spokesman for the TD said, ""Under the new licence fee structure, licence fees will be charged based on the rated power of e-PCs stated on their vehicle registration documents and VLs, and the fee levels will be suitably adjusted. On the one hand, the new licence fee maintains the attractiveness of electric vehicles (EVs) to continue encouraging drivers to switch to EVs to promote environmental protection, while on the other hand, it aligns with the technological advancements and practices in other regions. The licence fee structure and level for other vehicle classes remain unchanged.""

  The new five-tier licence fee structure based on rated power will comprise incremental adjustments in five phases over six years. The annual licence fee (ALF) for e-PCs from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2027 is tabulated as follows:




Rated power of e-PCs (kilowatts) (kW)
ALF from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2027 ($) (Note)


≤75
1,500


>75 to 125
2,000


>125 to 175
2,500


>175 to 225
3,000


>225
5,000


Note:
			
The ALF from March 1, 2027, onwards is set out in the Annex.
The Traffic Accident Victims Assistance Fund Levy is not yet included, i.e. $114 per vehicle for one year and $38 for four months at present.
The fee for a licence for four months is 35 per cent of that for an annual licence, plus an additional fee of $30.






  Under the new licence fee structure, according to the current distribution of licensed e-PCs, the rated power of 99 per cent of them fall within the first, second and third tiers, while the proportions of e-PCs in the fourth and fifth tiers are only 1 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.

Special arrangements for VL renewal during four-month grace period

  Existing e-PC owners should note that, if their VL expires on or before February 28, 2026, and the renewal application is submitted from November 1, 2025, to February 28, 2026, the prevailing licence fee structure and levels will apply.

  As for renewal of VLs expiring on or after March 1, 2026, or applications for first or re-issue of VLs submitted on or after November 1, 2025, the new licence fees will apply.

Provision of licence fee concession to eligible disabled e-PC owners

  The Government will offer licence fee concession to eligible disabled e-PC owners pursuant to the policy objective of social integration. If the rated power of such e-PC does not exceed 75 kW, no licence fee will be charged. If it exceeds 75 kW, the ALF will be charged by deducting an amount equal to the prescribed ALF for an e-PC with a rated power of no more than 75 kW from the ALF of its rated power tier. This arrangement will apply to eligible disabled persons who renew VLs expiring on or after March 1, 2026, or submit applications for first or re-issue of VLs on or after November 1, 2025.

  The TD has issued letters to the automotive trades and vehicle dealers concerned to remind them to take note of the implementation of the new licence fee structure. Notices have been displayed at the TD's Licensing Offices to introduce the above arrangements. The TD will also put up messages about the new fee structure through the ""Electronic Driving Licence"" mobile app and the e-Licensing Portal (elicensingportal.td.gov.hk/login).

  Members of the public may refer to the TD's websiteor call the hotline at 2804 2600 for details."
西九龍廢物轉運站火警事件,2025-10-29 16:12,2025-10-29 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202510/29/P2025102900473.htm,"​位於昂船洲的西九龍廢物轉運站今日（十月二十九日）下午發生火警，轉運站目前暫停運作。

今日下午約一時四十五分，轉運站內有垃圾起火冒煙，承辦商已即時通知消防處及疏散現場所有員工及使用者。消防接報到場後，於約下午二時三十分已大致撲滅火種，事件中無人受傷。

消防初步調查顯示起火原因無可疑，相信是承辦商燒焊工程所產生的火花引致。環境保護署（環保署）已責成承辦商在七日內提交火警報告。

環保署已暫停轉運站運作，以便承辦商作出清理及評估事件對轉運站的影響。在轉運站暫停運作期間，受影響的使用者可使用其他轉運站或直接將廢物送往堆填區棄置。環保署已就轉運站暫停運作通知業界，並會與業界保持密切聯絡。"
