Summer influenza season nears its end and winter influenza season yet to begin  Public must remain vigilant despite influenza activity declines,2026-01-03 20:00,2026-01-03 20:15,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010300678.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (January 3) reminded the public that seasonal influenza activity has gradually declined over the past two weeks to near baseline levels. This indicated that the summer influenza season, which began in early September last year, might conclude within the next one to two weeks. Nevertheless, the CHP urged the public to remain vigilant and maintain good personal and environmental hygiene at all times. Those who have not yet received seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV), particularly high-risk groups such as pregnant women, the elderly, children and those with underlying illnesses, should receive SIV promptly to reduce the risk of severe illness and death from infection.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------

""Hong Kong entered the summer influenza season in early September last year. The seasonal influenza activity peaked in mid-to-late October last year and has since been gradually declining. The latest surveillance data shows that the percentage of respiratory specimens tested positive for seasonal influenza viruses last week (December 21 to 27, 2025) decreased to 4.97 per cent from 7.81 per cent and 6.17 per cent in the previous two weeks (the baseline level is 4.94 per cent). The influenza admission rate in public hospitals was 0.28 cases per 10 000 population (lower than the 0.49 and 0.37 cases per 10 000 population recorded in the previous two weeks, with the baseline level of 0.27 cases per 10 000 population). Regarding outbreaks of influenza-like illness in schools, the number rose sharply from 15 outbreaks in the first week of the new school year last September to 170 outbreaks in mid-October, before gradually declining to 43 outbreaks in mid-November. After a slight rebound to 71 outbreaks in early December last year, the number has steadily decreased over the past few weeks, falling from over 30 outbreaks per week to just four outbreaks last week. The CHP will continue to closely monitor local surveillance data. Should relevant indicators persistently fall below the baseline levels, the CHP will assess next week whether this summer influenza season has concluded,"" the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.

The predominant virus circulating during this seasonal influenza season is influenza A (H3) virus strain. As in the past, severe or death cases associated with seasonal influenza primarily affect the elderly and children. As of January 1, this summer influenza season has recorded 25 severe paediatric influenza cases, including three fatal cases. The affected children aged between six months to 17 years old. Among them, 20 cases (80 per cent) had not received SIV (including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only four days before onset of illness. As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, the case was not protected by the vaccine. Therefore, it is not counted as vaccinated). During the same period, 502 severe influenza cases were recorded among adults, including 339 deaths. Among adult fatalities with available clinical data, over 80 per cent had underlying illnesses.

""Although the summer influenza season shows signs of ending and the winter influenza season has not yet begun, influenza activity may rise again as the weather gradually turns colder in the first quarter of this year. It cannot be ruled out that the circulating virus strains may change. Therefore, I once again urge all individuals aged six months or older, except those with known contraindications, who have not yet received SIV to act promptly. Although there are some antigenic differences between the currently circulating influenza A (H3) virus strain and the virus strain contained in the vaccine, SIV can still offer protection against the variant strain of subclade K, as well as the influenza A (H1) and influenza B strains included in the vaccine. Those who contracted influenza during the summer influenza season should still receive the 2025/26 SIV, if they have not yet done so, to guard against other circulating virus strains that may emerge during the forthcoming winter influenza season,"" Dr Tsui added.

2025/26 SIV Programmes
------------------------------

Getting vaccinated against influenza is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza and its complications. It also reduces the risk of serious illness or death from infection. With the concerted efforts of all sectors of the community (including the medical sector, schools, parents and residential care homes), as of December 28, 2025, over 1.89 million doses of influenza vaccine were administered under various SIV programmes in the year 2025/26, representing an increase of approximately 4.7 per cent compared with the same period in the previous influenza vaccination season. Regarding schools, to boost SIV rates, enrolment for the SIV School Outreach Programme has started earlier since the beginning of June last year. The CHP has also introduced enhancement measures, allowing all schools to choose either the live attenuated influenza vaccines (i.e. nasal LAIV) and the ""hybrid mode"", which allows schools to choose both the injectable inactivated influenza vaccines and the nasal LAIV during the same or different outreach vaccination activities. Vaccination rates among schoolchildren in different age groups are two per cent to nine per cent higher compared to the same period last year.

""The SIV coverage rate for children aged six months to under two years remains relatively low at about 22 per cent. Although this represents approximate five per cent point increase compared to the same period last year, it is still lower than that of other age groups. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to give consent for their children to receive SIV. The Government has opened all 29 of the DH's Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) for all children aged six months to under two years to receive the vaccine; as well as the District Health Centres and District Health Centre Expresses and their service outlets under the Primary Healthcare Commission in the 18 districts, and 74 Family Medicine Clinics and 38 public hospitals of the Hospital Authority to provide more choices for the public. For the list of vaccination venues, please refer to the CHP'sVaccination Schemespage. Parents of eligible children may book an appointment for their children to receive vaccination at designated MCHCs via theonline booking system,"" Dr Tsui said.

He reminded the members of the public to maintain good personal, hand and environmental hygiene. Furthermore, high-risk persons should receive COVID-19 booster doses at appropriate times to lower the risks of serious illness and death. Public with respiratory symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly to lower the risk of spreading the disease to high-risk persons.

Members of the public may refer to the CHP'sCOVID-19 & Flu Express,Seasonal Influenza Webpage,COVID-19 Vaccination Programme Webpage, andVaccination Schemes Webpage, for the latest information."
Update on chikungunya fever,2026-01-03 17:30,2026-01-03 17:45,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010300560.htm,"  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 3), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.

Latest surveillance data
-----------------------------------------------------

Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.

Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.

Government's comprehensive follow-up actions
-----------------------------------------------------

  Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date. The CHP continues to urge individuals who have recently hiked along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails to seek medical attention as soon as possible if they develop relevant symptoms and to call the enquiry hotline (Tel: 2125 2373), which operates from 9am to 6pm.

  The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.

Continuously strengthening prevention and control
---------------------------------------------------------

  The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:


carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.


​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.

Preventive measures to be taken by the public
----------------------------------------------------

Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:


read the label instructions carefully first;
apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
apply on exposed skin and clothing;
use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.


​The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of theCHPand theTravel Health Service, the latestTravel Health News,tips for using insect repellents, and the CHPFacebook Page,Instagram AccountandYouTube Channel, and also theMosquito Prevention and Control dedicated pageof the FEHD."

流感活躍程度回落　夏季流感季節快將完結　冬季流感季節仍未開始　市民須繼續保持警惕,2026-01-03 16:15,2026-01-03 16:30,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010300441.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月三日）提醒市民，季節性流感活躍程度在過去兩星期逐步回落至貼近基線水平，顯示自去年九月初開始的夏季流感季節有機會於未來一至兩周完結。雖然如此，中心提醒市民必須繼續保持警剔，時刻注意個人和環境衞生，尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的人士，特別是孕婦、長者、兒童及長期病患者等高危人士，應盡快接種流感疫苗，以減低相關重症和死亡的風險。

最新監測數據
——————

中心總監徐樂堅醫生說：「本港自去年九月初踏入夏季流感季節，季節性流感活躍程度於去年十月中下旬達到最高水平後開始輾轉回落。最新的監測數據顯示，上周（二○二五年十二月二十一日至十二月二十七日）的呼吸道樣本中季節性流感病毒陽性百分比由前兩周的7.81%和6.17%下降至4.97%（基線水平為4.94%），同期公立醫院的流感相關入院率為每一萬人0.28宗（較前兩周每一萬人0.49宗和0.37宗為低，而基線水平為每一萬人0.27宗）。學校流感爆發方面，自去年九月新學年開學首周的15宗，曾大幅上升至十月中的170宗，其後逐漸下降至十一月中的43宗。去年十二月初稍為反彈至71宗後，過去數周已逐步下降，由每周30多宗下降至上周只有四宗。中心會繼續密切監察本地數據，若相關指標持續下降至低於基線水平，中心下周將評估是次夏季流感季節是否已經完結。」

今次的季節性流感季節流行的主要病毒為甲型（H3）流感病毒。與季節性流感相關的嚴重或死亡個案和以往一樣，主要影響『一老一幼』。截至一月一日，今個夏季流感季節錄得25宗涉及兒童流感的嚴重個案，包括三宗死亡個案，涉及的兒童年齡介乎六個月至17歲。當中，20宗（80%）個案沒有接種季節性流感疫苗（包括一宗個案在發病前四天才接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗。由於接種後一般需要兩周身體才能產生足夠保護力，所以該病例未能受到疫苗保護。因此，該個案被視為未接種疫苗）。同期共錄得502宗成人嚴重流感個案，當中包括339宗死亡個案。在已掌握臨床資料的成人死亡個案中，超過八成有慢性疾病。

徐樂堅醫生續說：「雖然夏季流感季節有完結的跡象，冬季流感季節亦未開始，但隨着天氣在今年首季逐漸寒冷，流感活躍程度可能會再度上升，而流行病毒株不排除會發生改變，因此我再次呼籲所有年滿六個月或以上的人士，除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，若尚未接種季節性流感疫苗的市民，請從速行動。即使目前流行的甲型（H3）流感病毒與疫苗所含的病毒株存在一些抗原差異，季節性流感疫苗仍能對亞分支K的變異病毒株，以及疫苗中包含的甲型（H1）及乙型流感病毒提供保護。即使在夏季流感季節曾感染流感的人士，若尚未接種二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗亦應接種流感疫苗，以預防未來的冬季流感季節可能出現其他流行病毒株。」

二○二五／二六年度季節性流感疫苗接種計劃
————————————————————

接種流感疫苗是最有效預防流感及其併發症的方法之一，亦可減低重症及死亡的風險。在社會各界（包括醫療界、學校、家長、院舍等）的通力合作下，截至二○二五年十二月二十八日，二○二五／二六年度各項流感疫苗接種計劃共接種超過189萬劑疫苗，較上一流感疫苗接種季度同期增加約4.7%。學校方面，為提高接種率，中心提早於去年六月初開始接受學校報名參加季節性流感疫苗學校外展計劃，亦推出優化措施，讓所有學校均可選用噴鼻式減活流感疫苗或「混合模式」，即可於同一或不同的外展活動自由選用注射式滅活和噴鼻式減活流感疫苗。不同年齡組別學童的接種率較去年同期高2%至9%。

徐樂堅醫生說：「六個月至未滿兩歲的幼兒的季節性流感疫苗接種率仍處於較低水平，只有約22%。雖然較上一季度同期上升近五個百份點，但仍比其他年齡組別的接種率為低。中心已經透過基層醫療署呼籲家庭醫生，協助鼓勵家長同意為子女接種季節性流感疫苗。為便利市民接種疫苗，政府已開放全部29間衞生署母嬰健康院給所有六個月至兩歲以下的兒童接種疫苗；基層醫療署轄下18區的地區康健中心和地區康健站及其服務點；以及醫院管理局的74間家庭醫學診所和38間公立醫院，讓市民有更多可供選擇的接種地點。接種地點名單可參閱衞生防護中心疫苗計劃專頁。合資格兒童的家長亦可透過網上預約系統，為子女預約到指定母嬰健康院接種疫苗。」

他提醒市民必須繼續時刻注意個人、手部和環境衞生。此外，高風險人士應按時接種新冠疫苗的加強劑，以減低重症和死亡的風險。若出現呼吸道感染病徵，即使症狀輕微，亦應佩戴外科口罩和盡早求醫，以減低將病毒傳染給高危人士的風險。

CHP reminds public to take precautions against cold weather,2026-01-03 06:46,2026-01-03 07:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010200772.htm,"The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 3) reminded the public, particularly the elderly, people with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, pregnant women, infants and children, to adopt appropriate measures to protect their health in view of the cold weather.

Elderly and people with chronic illnesses
---------------------------------------------
  A spokesman for the CHP said that in general, elderly people have less insulating fat, and their body temperature control mechanisms would be weaker. Their body may not respond appropriately to the cold weather. In addition, some senior persons may have decreased mobility, which can impair their ability to generate and conserve body heat.

Chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, diabetes or hypothyroidism, would lower their metabolic rate, subsequently causing their body to generate less heat. Besides, persons with chronic illnesses, such as chronic respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, are vulnerable to disease aggravation due to cold weather.

 The spokesman reminded the public, in particular the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses, to adopt the following preventive measures:


Take note of the weather forecast. Wear warm clothing, including hats, scarves, gloves and socks, accordingly;
Consume sufficient food to ensure adequate calorie intake;
Perform regular exercise to facilitate blood circulation and heat production;
Stay in a warm environment. Avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower, and avoid prolonged outdoor exposure;
Use heaters with care and maintain adequate indoor ventilation;
Avoid alcoholic beverages. Drinking alcohol cannot keep you warm. Alcohol accelerates the loss of body heat through dilated blood vessels, resulting in chilling instead; and
Seek medical advice if feeling unwell.


Infants, children and pregnant women
-------------------------------------------

Infants and young children are more susceptible to heat loss during the cold weather. The spokesman reminded parents that they should ensure babies are sufficiently warm, but it is also important to keep babies relatively lightly clothed to avoid overheating them. When children engage in outdoor activities, their clothing should be adjusted accordingly, and changed quickly if soaked. Infants, young children and pregnant women should also try to avoid going out in the morning and at night when the temperature is lower.

 Parents should observe the following safety measures when putting their children to bed:

Keep the room well ventilated and at a comfortable temperature;
Always place babies on their backs to sleep. Leave their heads, faces and arms uncovered during sleep;
Babies do not need pillows. Place babies on a firm and well-fitted mattress to sleep. Avoid soft objects, pillows and loose bedding;
Let babies sleep in a cot placed near their parents' bed; and
Maintain a smoke-free environment.


Outdoor workers
-------------------

Outdoor workers should take heed of the weather report and wear appropriate warm clothing for work. Clothing should be changed as soon as possible if soaked. When the Cold Weather Warning is in force, they should take appropriate precautions. They should take a break immediately and seek help and medical attention if feeling unwell.

General public
----------------

In addition, many respiratory pathogens, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, may have increasing activity and community transmission during winter. Seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or above, except those with known contraindications. Persons at higher risk of getting influenza and its complications, including the elderly and children, should receive seasonal influenza vaccinations early. Please see details of the vaccination schemes on theCHP'swebsite.

A person who gets influenza and COVID-19 at the same time may become more seriously ill and would have a higher risk of death. It is important for elderly persons, especially those residing in residential care homes, to receive both a seasonal influenza vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. They should also receive an additional booster against COVID-19 according to recommendations as soon as possible. The public should also maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against respiratory illnesses and note the following:


Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from ill persons. It is essential for persons who are symptomatic (even if having mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask;
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly, including performing hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask;
Avoid touching one's eyes, mouth and nose;
Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
Cover the mouth and nose with tissue paper when sneezing or coughing. Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly into a lidded rubbish bin and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
Maintain good indoor ventilation;
When having respiratory symptoms, wear a surgical mask, refrain from work or attending classes at school, avoid going to crowded places and seek medical advice promptly; and
Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid overstress.

  
​Food-borne diseases, particularly those linked to hotpot cuisine, are also common in cold weather. The following preventive measures should be taken:


Wash hands before handling and consuming food;
Do not patronise unlicensed vendors or those with poor hygienic standards while selecting food;
Wash and cook all food thoroughly;
Vegetables should be washed thoroughly in clean running water before cooking and consumption. When appropriate, scrub vegetables with hard surfaces with a clean brush to remove dirt and substances, including pesticide residues and contaminants, from surfaces and crevices;
Shrimps should be fully cooked until the shells turn red and the flesh turns white and opaque;
For shellfish such as scallops and geoduck, scrub the shells thoroughly and remove internal organs;
Do not eat any undercooked freshwater aquatic products. To ensure that the food is thoroughly cooked, the centre of the food should reach a temperature of at least 75 degrees Celsius so as to destroy pathogens;
Most hotpot ingredients should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C or below, while frozen food should be stored in a freezer at -18 degrees C or below;
Never use raw eggs as a dipping sauce for hotpot; and
Use different sets of chopsticks to handle raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination.


​​In addition, when using fuel-burning appliances, especially in indoor areas, the public should ensure adequate ventilation to avoid harmful exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and prevent CO poisoning.

天氣寒冷市民應注意健康,2026-01-03 06:46,2026-01-03 07:00,Chi,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010200770.htm,"衞生署衞生防護中心（中心）今日（一月三日）表示，由於天氣寒冷，市民特別是重點人群包括長者、長期病患者、戶外工作人士、孕婦、嬰幼兒和兒童應採取適當措施，保障健康。

長者和長期病患者
————————
中心發言人表示，一般而言，長者皮下脂肪較少，加上體溫調節機能減退，身體未必能對氣溫下降作出適當反應。加上部分長者可能因為行動不便以致身體產生及保存熱能的能力減低。

慢性疾病如高血壓、糖尿病或甲狀腺功能減退等，更會減慢新陳代謝率，因而令患者減少製造熱能。此外，慢性呼吸道疾病或心腦血管疾病等長期病患者，亦會較易因氣溫驟降而令病情惡化。

發言人提醒市民，特別是長者和長期病患者，採取以下預防措施：


留意天氣預報，因應需要加穿禦寒衣物，包括帽、頸巾、手套及襪等；
進食足夠的食物，攝取充足的熱量；
經常做適量運動，以增加血液循環及產生熱能；
逗留在溫暖的環境內，盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出，亦應避免長時間暴露於戶外；
使用保暖電器時要注意安全，室內亦應保持空氣流通；
避免飲用含酒精的飲品，因為酒精會令血管擴張不但不能保暖，更令身體流失熱量，使人感到寒冷；及
如感到不適，應盡早求醫。


幼童和孕婦
—————

在寒冷天氣下，嬰幼兒比成人更易流失熱能，發言人提醒家長應確保嬰幼兒穿著足夠衣物保暖，但宜輕巧，以防過熱。當兒童進行户外體力活動時，應適量增減衣物，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。嬰幼兒和孕婦亦應盡量避開早晚氣温較低時段外出。

嬰兒就寢時，家長應注意以下安全事項：


保持房間空氣流通，溫度適中；
緊記讓嬰兒仰睡，確保他睡覺時頭部、面部及雙手外露，不會被遮蓋；
嬰兒不需要使用枕頭。讓嬰兒睡在堅實和大小適中的床褥上，切勿在嬰兒睡覺的地方放置軟身物件、枕頭和寬鬆被鋪；
與嬰兒共睡一室，最安全是讓嬰兒獨自在嬰兒床上睡覺，並把嬰兒床放在父母的床邊；及
締造無煙環境。


戶外工作人士
——————

戶外工作人士需留意天氣報告，穿着適當禦寒衣物工作，如衣物濕透時，應及時更換。在寒冷天氣警告生效期間，應採取適當的預防措施。如有不適應立即暫停工作、尋求協助及求醫。

一般市民
————

​另外，多種呼吸道病原體，包括流感及新型冠狀病毒在內，可能在冬季轉趨活躍並同時傳播。除個別有已知禁忌症人士外，所有年滿六個月或以上的人士都建議接種季節性流感疫苗。有較高風險患上流感及其併發症的人士，包括長者及兒童，應盡快接種流感疫苗。詳情請參閱衞生防護中心有關疫苗接種計劃的網站。

同時患上流感與2019冠狀病毒病的患者有較大可能出現嚴重併發症和死亡。接種流感疫苗與2019冠狀病毒病疫苗對於長者，尤其居於院舍的院友同樣重要，他們亦應盡快按建議接種2019冠狀病毒病疫苗額外加強劑。市民亦應保持良好個人和環境衞生，以防感染呼吸道疾病，注意事項包括：


病人佩戴外科口罩可以預防傳播呼吸道病毒，因此出現病徵（即使症狀輕微）的人士佩戴外科口罩十分重要；
在乘搭交通工具或在人多擠迫的地方逗留時，應佩戴外科口罩。正確佩戴口罩十分重要，包括在佩戴口罩前及脫下口罩後，保持手部衞生；
避免觸摸眼睛、口和鼻；
雙手一旦染污，應使用梘液和清水以正確方法洗手；
當雙手沒有明顯污垢時，用含70%至80%的酒精搓手液潔淨雙手；
打噴嚏或咳嗽時，應用紙巾掩着口鼻，把用過的紙巾棄置於有蓋垃圾箱內，其後應徹底洗手；
保持室內空氣流通；
當出現呼吸道感染病徵，應戴上外科口罩，不應上班或上學，避免前往人多擠逼的地方，及盡早向醫生求診；及
保持均衡飲食、恆常運動及充足休息，不要吸煙和避免過大的生活壓力。


​​一些經由食物傳播的疾病特別是與火鍋食品有關的疾病，在天氣寒冷時也很常見，市民應採取以下預防措施：


處理食物及進餐前應該洗淨雙手；
選擇食物時，不要光顧無牌或衞生環境惡劣的商戶；
徹底清潔並煮熟所有食物；
蔬菜應以流動清水徹底沖淨，方可烹煮食用。在適當的情況下，可用乾淨的刷子刷洗帶有硬皮的農產品，以去除表面和縫隙間的污物雜質，包括除害劑殘餘和污染物；
蝦應徹底煮熟，並待殼變紅及蝦肉變白和不透明後才進食；
貝類海產如帶子及象拔蚌等的外殼應洗擦乾淨，並去除內臟；
切勿進食任何未完全煮熟的淡水水產。為確保食物徹底煮熟，食物的中心溫度須至少達到攝氏75度，以消滅致病菌；
大部分火鍋材料都應存放在攝氏四度或以下的冷凍格內，冷藏食物則應放在攝氏負18度或以下的冰箱內；
切勿以生雞蛋作為火鍋蘸醬；及
使用不同筷子夾取生熟食物，以免交叉污染。


​​此外，市民使用燃燒燃料的裝置時，特別在室內地方，須確保有良好的通風，以免因吸入一氧化碳引致中毒，損害健康。

Public hospitals experience smooth operations on second day of public healthcare fees and charges reform,2026-01-03 00:44,2026-01-03 01:00,Eng,gia,https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202601/03/P2026010300009.htm,"The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

On the second day (January 2) of the implementation of the Hospital Authority public healthcare fees and charges reform (fees and charges reform), public hospitals maintained smooth operation. The HA will continue to deploy additional manpower across various departments at hospitals to assist patients in need.

On the first day (January 1) of the fees and charges reform, 3 888 patients attended the Accident and Emergency departments (A&E) of 18 public hospitals, a decrease of about 25 per cent when comparing to New Year's Day last year. From midnight to 2pm yesterday (January 2), 2 329 patients attended all A&E, approximately 30 per cent fewer than the same time period of January 2 of last year. Among the patients seeking medical consultation, there were 34 critical cases and 82 emergency cases. According to the new fees and charges arrangement, these two categories of patients will have their A&E charges fully exempted. The other cases subject to the new fees and charges arrangement include 986 urgent cases, 1 171 semi-urgent cases, and 56 non-urgent cases. The average waiting times for semi-urgent and non-urgent cases was around 55 minutes, which is shorter compared to the average waiting time for the same period last year (approximately 147 minutes) for semi-urgent and non-urgent cases.

Additionally, the HA's 75 Family Medicine Clinics (FMCs) providing family medicine outpatient services also operated smoothly yesterday. As of 2pm yesterday, approximately 10 000 patients attended these FMCs, with overall service usage remaining similar to that before the implementation of the measures.

The HA has deployed additional manpower to expedite the processing of patients' medical fee waivers applications. As of 2pm yesterday, public hospitals received approximately 3 300 applications in total for the day, with nearly 90per cent approved, amounting to about 2 900 applications. The remaining cases will be processed as soon as possible. Compared to the 14 000 individuals who were approved for medical fee waivers in 2023/24, the HA has approved approximately 35 000 applications since early November last year, benefiting citizens in need.

Furthermore, patients who had previously scheduled non-urgent radiology services or pathology services will be receiving payment notifications through mail or the HA mobile application HA Go starting from January 1. The HA reminds patients with recent appointments can arrange payment as early as practicable upon receiving the notification. For patients with distant appointment dates, payment can be arranged at their convenience after receiving the notification. Patients are not required to settle the payment immediately. Patients undergoing non-urgent radiology services must settle the payment at least 14 days before their appointment date, while patients requiring pathology services must settle the payment before testing. If patients have questions regarding payment items, they can inquire with healthcare staff during follow-up appointment, and specialist out-patient clinics will also have Integrated Patient Service Centres to provide detailed explanations about payment arrangements.

The HA reminds patients that the fees and charges reform has been implemented. Patients are advised to familiarise themselves with the new fees and charges arrangements before visiting public hospitals or outpatient clinics. Some medical service procedures have also been modified. Every cluster has set up hotlines (see table below) for patients to inquire about the fees and charges reform arrangements. Patients can also visit the HA website to learn about the new arrangements.
