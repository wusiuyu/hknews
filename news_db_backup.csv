The California-based tech giant claimed a market share of 15 percent in the world's number two economy, behind Huawei's 16 percent and top-ranking Vivo's 17 percent, according to industry data provider Canalys.

Also coming in at 15 percent, with total smartphone sales narrowly behind Apple's, were Chinese brands Oppo and Honor, the data showed.

Apple's performance in the country is suffering from a slump in iPhone sales, which dropped to 42.9 million in 2024, compared to a market-leading 51.8 million the previous year.

""Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape,"" said Amber Liu, Research Manager at Canalys, adding that Apple ""faced growing competitive pressure from domestic flagship devices"".

Top-ranked Vivo showed ""strong momentum"" last year, Liu said, noting that the firm's strategy was helping ""solidify its position in entry-level to mid-to-high-end segments"".

Meanwhile, Huawei, a Shenzhen-based tech giant that was once the target of tough sanctions from Washington, continued a resurgence in its home market in 2024.

The firm achieved a 37 percent year-on-year jump in total smartphone shipments last year, the Canalys data showed.

Apple's iPhone remains popular in China, but many consumers in the vast market have switched to domestic alternatives in recent years as sector competition intensifies. (AFP)"

The association’s president Wingco Lo said small and medium-sized companies are facing several challenges at the moment. 

""Currently we are facing a couple of difficulties, like the pricing from the importer, and also the geopolitical pressure, and also the operating [costs]. We are suggesting the government have more support for the small and medium companies to promote local businesses,"" he said.

Lawmaker Jimmy Ng, and the association's executive committee member, said he wants to see more bilateral free trade agreements between the SAR and emerging economies. 

""We should now focus more on the Asean countries and the Belt and Road countries. For a traditional market they are either not rich enough now or they are not very friendly to us.

湯家驊說，販運人口很多時涉及跨境元素，亦會涉及不同人士參與不同程度的行動，例如有人負責詐騙、有人負責販運、有人負責禁錮及有人強迫受害人從事非法工作等，如果只是以欺詐罪檢控，可能只可控告其中一類人士，其他人士未必可以受到相關罪名檢控。

他指出，販運人口最接近的罪行性質是綁架，而在本港綁架最高刑罰是終生監禁，販運人口的刑罰應該與綁架看齊。

警方日前拘捕一名涉嫌串謀詐騙的女子，並表示會向法庭建議同類案件加刑。湯家驊認為，無論如何加刑，法庭都是處理欺詐罪，有關罪行已有上限，加刑尺度有限，未必是最適合處理方法，他認為最適合都是增加一條販運人口罪行。"

機管局稱機場城市發展藍圖新品牌潛力大　有信心吸引其他企業合作,2025-01-16 17:01,,2025-01-16 17:13,local,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1787833-20250116.htm,"機管局舉辦活動，向商界介紹機場城市發展藍圖新品牌「Skytopia」，吸引超過300名來自香港、內地及國際商貿代表出席。

機管局說，品牌下有多個項目，包括香港首個融合藝術創作、鑑賞及貿易於一身的一站式藝術廊總匯；全港首個藝術倉儲設施；提供超過500個遊艇泊位的機場海灣碼頭；空運鮮活市場；亞洲博覽館第二期發展等等。

機管局商務執行總監陳正思表示，「Sktyopia」整個項目大約1000億元，其中300億元為基建費，由機管局承擔，用內部資源支付，部分項目已經動工，如亞博館二期工程。至於餘下700億元，機管局會與私人企業合作推展項目，並進行全球招商，陳正思說，項目的潛力非常大，有信心吸引其他企業與機管局合作。

被問到為何揀選有關項目類別發展，陳正思說，主要考慮到香港及機場的獨有優勢，包括國際化的自由港，擁有很好的航空網絡，因此會發展具有香港特色的項目，例如藝術方面，由於國際藝術品交易非常蓬勃，因此計劃興建藝術倉儲設施及發展成藝術廊總匯。至於會否與西九文化區的功能重疊，陳正思說希望產生協同效應，「做大個餅」將整個產業做好，機管局會較著重藝術品的儲藏及藝術品的一手銷售。

至於空運鮮活市集方面，她指香港機場是全球貨運量最高的機場，因此不少貨物可以很快由全球各地運到香港，例如不少人都認為在香港吃魚生特別好吃，她說主要因為魚生可以很快到港，屬於香港獨特的優勢。"

黃光耀說，新的開發模式與過往政府賣地不同，發展商需要為政府興建很多社區設施，涵蓋規模和面積都較大，集團仍需了解項目細節和發展時間，以進一步評估參與開發的興趣。

另外，地政總署資料顯示，去年補地價收入約52.4億元，按年大跌73%。黃光耀相信屬供求問題，去年本港一手物業銷售不俗，但2022和2023年受加息影響，發展商庫存量相對較高及融資成本偏高，在吸納新項目時較審慎。他相信，隨著減息效應逐漸浮現，今年吸納量有機會回到正常水平。

他又說，集團補地價項目不多，今年會留意政府、市建局或港鐵的地皮招標把握吸納新項目機會。"

摩根大通證券表示，強勁的工資增長趨勢及新的價格壓力，支持1月加息，如果美國總統特朗普就職未有引起重大市場波動，加息延後至3月將被視為過度增加市場波動風險。

Authorities said approximately 18,000 spectators will attend, with about 4,000 gathering on the ground-level turf area. 

Tang King-shing, the venue's director for strategic planning, said that assessing the turf's use will be one area of focus during their testing.

""The stage and the spectators will be sitting on protective layer using I-track, it's the name of the protective layer, so there won't be any question of damaging the turf itself. So that's why before we have been emphasising the fact that as far as the surface of the main stadium is concerned, it's a flexible arrangement,"" he said.  

""We can use genuine turf for high-quality football or rugby events and use the layer underneath, the I-track, for concert events like the one coming this Saturday by simply removing the turf.""

Commissioner for Sports George Tsoi said event organisers have chosen to close the roof for this concert to better test their acoustics and audio effects.

""We hope we can have the opportunity to test out all the different elements and the coordination amongst our different staff and as well as the arrival and dispersal of our audience,"" he said. 

""We hope that we can have good experience and further improve our operations in future.""

Tsoi said doors will open for concert goers at 4pm, with the performance scheduled to start at 6pm and wrap up before 8pm. 

He added that attendees should have already gotten their tickets in advance and they should review the list of prohibited items prior to arriving. 

Tsoi said more test events are to come, with each one increasing in scale and sophistication, highlighting another large test on January 24 with over 60,000 participants to prepare for the official opening of the Sports Park in March.   

Principal Transport Officer/Urban of the Transport Department Eric Wan said the MTR will implement special service arrangements, including increased train frequencies, and KMB and Citybus will organise three bus routes serving East Kowloon, West Kowloon and Hong Kong Island during the dispersal period."

""Of course our country helps a lot. During their trip, our officials met officials at the Chinese Embassy in Thailand. Organisations from our country are also working behind the scenes to get the 12 home safely,"" he told NOW TV.

Tang said the Hongkongers, in their early 20s to 40s, were tricked into travelling to Thailand by gangs who falsely promised them well-paid jobs and good accommodation.

Two other SAR residents who suffered a similar fate were recently freed after their families paid ransoms, according to the police. Tang said people should contact the police if they are asked to hand over money to secure the release of relatives held captive. 

Tang also offered advice for people who suspect they have been tricked into travelling abroad, saying they should scream while in a public place and seek help immediately. 

He said from 2022 to 2023, 46 people from Hong Kong were deceived into working for scamming syndicates in Southeast Asia, with the majority eventually returning to the SAR.

立法會去年7月通過《2024年牙醫註冊（修訂）條例草案》，政府其後於去年底向立法會提交第二份生效日期公告，以先訂立後審議程序，並已於昨日通過審議期。
　　 
發言人指，現行法例並無規定牙醫須在註冊前經過實習或評核期，與醫生的做法截然不同。《條例》引入實習和評核期要求，旨在回應近年來牙醫業界的意見，加強本地牙科畢業生和非本地培訓牙醫於實際工作場景的臨牀經驗。有關安排對進一步提升牙醫的專業水平有莫大裨益。

陳茂波說，香港全條鏈募融資和專業服務可支持企業拓展國際市場，特別為全球南方國家提供更普惠包容的金融服務，支持當地經濟社會發展。

陳茂波表示，特區政府銳意發展金融科技，去年本港金融科技企業數目有逾1100家，按年上升15%，包括8家數字銀行和4家數字保險公司，期待金融機構可持續運用新技術，提升營運效率的同時，讓金融服務更貼近不同行業需要，不同階層市民需要。

他又說，香港具有國際化的創科氛圍，約4700家香港初創公司中，接近20%創辦人來自海外地區，政府亦提供政策支持和監管便利，包括設立金融科技監管沙盒，鼓勵科技加快研發新產品和新服務，沙盒自去年10月底以來，共有360個金融科技項目試行。

體育專員蔡健斌表示，當天的演唱會將於傍晚6時開始，晚上約7時45分至8時左結束，參加者會分別用3個閘口，G、H及J進場，門票上已印有相關閘口的資料。他又提醒，觀眾帶備的燈牌大小都設有限制，入場時工作人員會檢查，專業攝影器材，超過38乘20乘30厘米的燈牌，不能帶進場。一如以往，長傘，水樽等都不能帶入場內。

蔡健斌提到，今次演唱會的主辦單位選擇在活動期間關上天幕，目的是想測試音響效果，大型演唱會一般不會使用場館的音響設施，主辦單位一般自行帶備音響器材。

他表示，本月24日體育園會進行另一次大型壓力測試，屆時會有超過6萬人進行參與，為3月體育園正式開幕做好準備，並預告體育園亦會不只一次，進行超過5萬人參與的測試。

運輸署首席運輸主任尹柏恩說，本周六測試當天，港鐵會有特別車務安排，包括進場和散場會加密班次。另外，散場時段，九巴與城巴會安排3條行走九龍東、九龍西及港島的巴士路線，合共超過10部巴士投入服務，以進一步熟習特別巴士服務的運作和檢視需求。

警務處秀茂坪區指揮官謝翠恩預計，當天進場及離場高峰期會較為集中，特別在離場時間，但從上次測試的經驗所得，由於今次散場在晚飯時間，因此未必所有觀眾都同一時間全部乘車離去，部分人士可能會留在零售館或附近餐廳消費，警方屆時會密切留意人流及車流的情況。"

李昌鏞表示，通脹目標是貨幣決策的核心，等到國內政局穩定下來、美國新政府上場後市場較確定後，再調整政策是合適。

李昌鏞說，政策動盪影響經濟，增長下行風險加劇，進一步減息的必要性提高，又指韓元下跌主要因為美元上升，但養老基金外匯對沖操作有助減少損失。

This came as police in Hong Kong arrested a woman for allegedly luring two females from the SAR to Southeast Asia and forcing them to take part in scams. 

The 32-year-old has been charged with conspiracy to defraud. 

Undersecretary for Security Michael Cheuk led a delegation to Thailand earlier in the week to help 12 Hong Kong residents who were detained in Myanmar and Cambodia.

Speaking on RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme, Johnny Ng noted the two governments took the matter very seriously.

He believes this will allow the public to realise the seriousness of the matter.

""This is a very, very good education to let the general public know that we cannot take free air tickets, or free hotels, hospitality... in order to get more unbalanced [rewards] from some jobs,"" he said.

He suggested the SAR government reach out to its Myanmar and Cambodian counterparts directly, as well as step up cooperation with international police with the help of the central government.

While Hong Kong raised the travel alert for Thailand to amber in 2014 due to mass demonstrations in the country, Ng said there was no urgent need to raise the alert level amid the current situation, as it remains a safe destination."

陳茂波出席促進數字經濟新質生產力發展峰會致辭時表示，數字化是全球經濟發展的趨勢和重要動力，對一個地方的經濟發展舉足輕重，以數字產業化和產業數字化為核心的新經濟形態，與新質生產力的高科技、高效能、高質量特徵相互驅動，是推動經濟朝高質量發展的關鍵內涵，隨著人工智慧，大數據和雲計算等等技術迅速發展，數字化能讓企業提升效率，降低成本，從而提高生產力和競爭力。

他說特區政府在三年前已宣布成立數字化經濟發展委員會，著力在三方面工作，包括促進數據的流動、擴建數字基建和加快數字化轉型，以及培育人才。

出席同一活動的全國政協副主席、大灣區國際信息科技協會主席梁振英在致辭時表示，各國正在加強立法和監管，以及構建數據流動的全球化標準，香港作為國際金融貿易和航運中心，擁有獨特優勢，包括與國際接軌的金融體系、法治以及其他優越的營商環境，這為今次峰會發起成立國際數據產業聯盟，提供理想的條件。"

劉光源出席促進數字經濟新質生產力發展峰會致辭表示，數據要素流動對於促進貿易便利化、加快產業數字轉型、實現以數據流動為牽引的新型全球化至關重要；國際社會在促進及推動數據跨境流動合作等方面，有著共同意願，亦做了大量工作。香港作為亞太數據中心樞紐，在有效保護數據產權、規範數據交易、降低數據跨境風險、實現數據安全高效流動等方面發揮作用。

劉光源說，在國家的大力支持和社會各界的共同努力下，香港積極挖掘數據要素的潛力，搶佔數字經濟新賽道，取得了顯著的成績。香港科研實力雄厚，數字基礎設施完善，高素質科技人才匯聚，完全可以將數字經濟發展，與鞏固提升三大中心地位相結合，與大灣區建設國家發展相結合，更好發揮香港的獨特地位和優勢。

劉光源又說，在人工智能時代的強演算法加持下，數據改變人類生產生活方式，創造經濟和社會價值的同時，也帶來了數據過度採集、數據偏見與歧視，及數字身份污名化等新的倫理挑戰，個人隱私洩露、大數據殺熟，及短視頻上癮等社會問題，更引發人類對演算法的恐慌情緒；妥善應對這些挑戰，是確保資料技術被善用而不是被濫用。他說，在探討數據倫理的全球問題和解決方案中，香港可以交流經驗及反映觀點，不斷提升國家在全數據倫理領域的話語權和影響力。"

The announcement came as SAR officials vowed to work with Bangkok to try to rescue a dozen Hongkongers being held captive in countries neighbouring Thailand. 

Police said a beauty worker, 32, had been charged with conspiracy to defraud and was due to appear at Shatin Magistrates' Courts on Thursday.

At a press conference, officers said she was suspected of enticing two women, aged 21 and 23, to Thailand in late December. The women were driven to a ""scam hub"" in Myanmar where they were forced to take part in fraudulent activities, officers said.

The pair returned to Hong Kong this month after their families paid ransoms, police said. 

The women told officers there were armed guards at the site where they were held and the area was surrounded by a barbed wire fence. 

Chief Inspector Yu Pok-hon said the arrested woman is believed to have socialised with the two victims to gain their trust, before offering them free travel and job opportunities in Thailand.

The force urged people to be wary of online adverts promising jobs with large salaries, and not to put too much trust in friends they have made only recently. 

Meanwhile, Security Secretary Chris Tang said he has been briefed by a government task force sent to Thailand over reports of other Hongkongers being held in dangerous locations after being tricked into travelling to Bangkok. 

Tang said the administration will continue to liaise with Thai authorities to bring home 12 SAR residents being held prisoner in Myanmar and Cambodia. 

More than a dozen other victims have already returned to Hong Kong, officials said on Tuesday.

Since the start of December, Shenzhen residents with the visas have been allowed to visit the SAR for as many times as they like, compared to a previous restriction of one trip per week.

Law said last month, there were more than 3.1 million mainland visitor arrivals, or an average of more than 100,000 a day.

But only four models had the actual capacity that was stated. The rest of them held less liquid than claimed. 

Five mugs or tumblers, from Muji, 24Bottles, Decathlon, National Geographic, and PoleBear, were found to have a discrepancy in capacity of more than 10 percent. 

“The Council reminds manufacturers that their product design must take into consideration the actual usage by consumers and clearly and accurately state on the product label the actual capacity,” said convenor of the council’s advisory group on digital economy and information technology Jack Poon.   

The watchdog also passed the results to the Customs and Excise Department for potential follow up actions.

In the thermal insulation efficacy test, two stainless steel tumblers from NOC and Stanley performed well as they were able to keep the water temperature at over 60 degrees Celsius after six hours. 

Thirteen models could maintain the water temperature at above 40 degrees Celsius, but the water temperature in three plastic mugs or tumblers, dropped significantly to between 29 and 26.3 degrees.  

For cold drinks with temperatures from five degrees to minus one degree Celsius, temperatures from three plastic models rose to as much as 22 degrees after six hours. 

Two-thirds of samples showed a satisfactory performance in the leak-proof test. 

The council reminded people to clean their tumblers or mugs as often as they could and recommended they use tools like small brushes to wash narrow bottles.

“It's better for you to clean it thoroughly because you never know when the pathogenic bacteria will breed in your container. So the cleaner it is, the better for your food safety,” the council’s chief executive Gilly Wong said.

“When you buy this kind of tumbler, check out how many parts they have so that you know you have to open it up and how to clean it and put it back, ensure that you know it performs as well as its original,” she said."

The initiative, set to last for three years, aims to process a total of 1,200 cases and help 2,400 people who are going through a separation or divorce.

Alice Mak, secretary for home and youth affairs, said the scheme handled 38 cases relating to alimony as of the end of November. 

""Sixty percent of the cases have either reached an agreement or partially made an agreement, meaning there's an outcome from the mediation. For those completed cases, it takes roughly 24 days from opening to closing a file,"" she said during an exclusive interview with RTHK.

""We can see that these mediation services have indeed helped some divorcees to reach maintenance agreements. Some of the participants told us that they found it helpful and they would recommend programme to those in need around them.""

As for the remaining 40 percent, Mak said the administration would look into possible follow-up actions after collecting more data. 

Separately, the minister said her bureau and the Family Council will jointly organise the ""Hong Kong Excellent Family Awards"" in the second quarter, with participants being judged on a number of areas. 

She said families must show how well they support each other and whether they have experiences on educating the next generation which are worthy of being referenced, among other criteria."

Cheuk was also pleased with the progress made by the task force, and expressed gratitude to their Thai counterparts for attaching great importance to the matter.

Speaking to reporters upon landing at Hong Kong airport on Tuesday evening, the former assistant police commissioner confirmed that 11 of the trapped SAR residents are in Myanmar, while the remaining one is in Cambodia.

He described their locations as chaotic and not safe, while armed forces are also present.

Cheuk pointed out that all of the victims fell for job scams, and were lured by the syndicates to Bangkok and picked up at the airport.

""So far, none of the 72 people who sought assistance were abducted. In this regard, Thailand remains a very safe place,"" he said, although he cautioned against visiting regions bordering Myanmar, Laos or Cambodia.

SAR authorities will now reach out to their counterparts in Myanmar, but admitted the situation was quite complicated.

Cheuk also quoted Thai officials as saying that safety measures will be rolled out this week to enhance the safety of tourists.

These include a 24-hour hotline that supports eight languages, and a mobile app that allows users to share their real-time location to law enforcement in emergency situations.

The number two security official in Hong Kong also explained why the task force embarked on a visit to Thailand when the SAR residents are held elsewhere.

He said Thailand has a lot of exchanges with neighbouring countries both historically and culturally, and Thai officials have numerous ways to talk to people in the region, including unofficial means.

Before he left the airport, Cheuk received a petition letter from a man whose brother is among those unlawfully detained.

The man, who gave his name as Kelvin, hopes to meet the task force soon and receive the latest update on the situation."
Test strips to be used to detect space oil drug,2025-01-15 10:18,"Police will use rapid test kits from Saturday to detect etomidate, a regulated sedative in ""space oil"" drugs.

Chief Inspector of the narcotics bureau Kelvin Cheung said the test will serve as an aid during operations when officers suspect products could contain etomidate, a short-acting anaesthetic normally used as an ingredient for the narcotic.

""The officers will conduct the stop-and-search in an ordinary manner. When they find the vapes, they will conduct enquiries, they will ask questions, and they will also conduct observations before conducting the interception,"" Cheung said.

""If they, after conducting all the necessary enquiries at the scene, are still unable to form the reasonable belief, and they still suspect that the vapes actually contain etomidate... they will use the test kit.""

The kit contains a testing strip used to swab samples of alternative smoking products. It will then be mixed with a solution that can show a positive or negative result in less than a minute.

The accuracy of the test can reach up to 99 percent, Cheung said, adding that the force has procured a sufficient amount of testing kits.

Etomidate is a controlled drug that is prescribed by a doctor and is currently classified as a Part 1 poison.

The number of arrests relating to the controlled drug skyrocketed from eight in 2023 to 206 in the first 11 months of last year. Nearly 23 percent of those arrested last year were people aged below 21, with the youngest being only 12 years old.

Sky, who is said to be about 20 years old, first got a taste of the space oil drug at a bar. Speaking at a police press event, Sky said it looked like a normal e-cigarette. Sky later became addicted to the drug and started experiencing memory loss.

""Sometimes I forgot what I did. I also had errors in my judgement. When my friends saw the traffic light was red, I thought it was green and walked out onto the road,"" Sky said.

Leo Man, from the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, told the same event that etomidate is very addictive. He said there has been a case where someone taking the drug died after mistaking a window for a door.

The government is planning to list etomidate as a dangerous drug on February 14.

Once listed, those illegally possessing or consuming space oil drugs containing the sedative would face a maximum of seven years in prison and a fine of HK$1 million.

And those trafficking or illegally importing the drug would be liable to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of HK$5 million."

In a complaint filed in Washington, DC federal court, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of five per cent of Twitter's common shares.

An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022 in Musk's case, when they cross a five per cent ownership threshold.

The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk instead bought more than US$500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2 percent stake.

Twitter's share price rose more than 27 per cent following that disclosure, the SEC said.

Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve.

Musk eventually purchased Twitter for US$44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X.

Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure.

In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that ""all indications"" were that his delay was a mistake. (Reuters)"

Some of the “TikTok refugees,” as they call themselves, say the TikTok alternative, a Chinese app, is being chosen in protest of the TikTok ban.

The US Supreme Court is due to rule on a law that stipulates TikTok must be divested from its Chinese parent company ByteDance by January 19 or face a ban in the US over national security concerns.

After the justices seemed inclined to let the law stand, masses of TikTok users began creating accounts on Xiaohongshu, including hashtags such as #tiktokrefugee or #tiktok to their posts. 

Since Monday, Xiaohongshu has become the top downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store in the US.

Xiaohongshu, which in English means “Little Red Book”, is a Chinese social media app that combines e-commerce, short video and posting functions.

The app has gained traction in China and other regions and countries with a Chinese diaspora, racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as make-up and skincare tutorials.

The #tiktokrefugee topic has racked up over 160,000 posts on Xiaohongshu, many of which are videos of American users introducing themselves and asking for tips on how to navigate the app, which they are calling “RedNote”.

An American user with the handle Definitelynotchippy made a video addressed to the Chinese users of Xiaohongshu, explaining why Americans are downloading the app.

“The reason that our government is telling us that they are banning TikTok is because they’re insisting that it’s owned by you guys, the Chinese people, government, whatever,” she said. “And they’re trying to make us think that you guys are bad.”

Chinese users on Xiaohongshu have so far welcomed American users, with some offering to teach them Chinese. Others have offered tips on navigating the Chinese internet. In some cases, Chinese students have asked the Americans for help with their English homework. (AP)"

The producer price index rose 0.2 percent last month, a reassuring figure to investors concerned about inflation risk.

But the recent jump in the 10-year US Treasury note, which edged down on Tuesday, has left investors worried that equities may be overvalued in light of the risk of higher interest rates for longer, said Art Hogan of B. Riley Wealth Management.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 0.5 percent at 42,518.

The broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent to 5,842, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.2 percent to 19,044.

Hogan said Wednesday's deluge of bank earnings should show strong profitability. A key question will be the companies' expectations for the incoming Trump administration in Washington.

""There's a lot of interest ... in how they see the future,"" Hogan said of expectations that Trump could ease bank regulation.

Among individual companies, Eli Lilly dropped 6.6 percent after it said 2024 revenues would be lower than previously thought.

Biogen sank 4.7 percent after Sage Therapeutics said the company had submitted an unsolicited bid to purchase the smaller company. Sage dropped 1.2 percent.

But KB Home rose 4.8 percent after reporting higher earnings and profits, describing a solid housing market.

""Buyers continued to demonstrate a desire for home ownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year, despite ongoing mortgage interest rate headwinds,"" said KB Homes Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger. (AFP)"

Stuart Russell, co-chair of the World Economic Forum's Council on AI, made the remarks after delivering a keynote speech at the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum, where he stressed the importance of governance in AI.

When asked about the latest AI chip export rules proposed by the outgoing Biden administration in the US, Russell pointed out that while competition is normal among nations and firms, cooperation should always come first when it comes to the question of safety.

""The US and China have agreed not to use AI to control the launch of nuclear weapons, which I think is pretty sensible,"" he said. ""Safety failures damage the entire industry. So I really hope we can cooperate on this dimension.""

He also referred to artificial general intelligence technology (AGI) – which is a type of AI that is equal to or surpasses human intelligence – as a source of infinite wealth, which will be responsible for the vast majority of economic output in the future.

""Arguing over who owns [AGI] is like arguing over who has more copies of the digital newspaper. Why would you argue with that when you could just make as many more copies as you want?"" he said.

""If we have a source of unlimited wealth for humanity, we should just use it for humanity and not try to own it or prevent others from gaining access to it,"" he added.

Touching on Hong Kong's AI development potential, Russell said the city can make use of its unique financial strengths to develop targeted AI systems for its trade-related services.

He said some drifters also encountered difficulties when starting a business in Hong Kong, such as getting licences. 

“Like if they want to open a restaurant, the requirements from different government departments are quite complicated and stringent,” Zhang said.

Some 45 percent of respondents also said they had trouble building connections at work.

Zhang said the drifters also needed more support as they do not have family and friends in Hong Kong, and the language barrier also hindered them from building relationships in the city.  

More than 10 percent of respondents found there was a lack of smoking areas in Hong Kong, and think the government should not impose more tobacco control measures at this stage."
Serious abuse of public housing could be made a crime,2025-01-14 16:00,"The Housing Department plans to make serious misuse of public housing a criminal offense, with potential fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year. Offenders may include tenants subletting or using units for business, who currently face eviction as the toughest punishment. The authority also seeks to check suspicious individuals' identities during inspections, and extend the time period for bringing cases to court to six years or one year after discovery. The proposals are subject to review by Legco's housing panel and potential changes.",2025-01-16 16:15,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1787454-20250114.htm,"Serious misuse of public housing could be made a criminal offence, Housing Department sources said on Tuesday.
 
At present the toughest punishment for tenants who break the rules, for example by subletting their units or using them for business purposes, is eviction. 

But plans are in place to amend the Housing Ordinance to allow the Housing Authority to prosecute offenders, with proposed fines of up to HK$500,000 and jail terms of up to a year. 

It's understood the authority also wants officials to be given the power to check the identity of any suspicious people they encounter while carrying out inspections at public flats. Anyone who refuses to hand over their details could be fined HK$10,000 or imprisoned for six months. 

Providing false statements to the authorities can already lead to prosecution, but officials want to extend the time period for bringing cases to court to six years after the offence, or one year after it is discovered, whichever comes first. 

The authority's subsidised housing committee held a meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the plans. 

Speaking to reporters afterwards, Cleresa Wong, who chairs the committee, said she believes the proposed legislation would have a deterrent effect. 

“We do not propose to encompass all abuses under the new piece of legislation that we are proposing. We will only focus on the severe abuses and the reason is because if convicted, the people who are charged with these kinds of crimes would be criminalised, and they would have a criminal record. And so that, I think, is a deterrence,” she said. 

The proposed legal amendments would not be applied retrospectively, it is believed. 

“As a matter of law, legal principles, it is very rare for a government to introduce crimes with retrospective effect because this is somehow contrary to natural justice and fairness,” Wong said. 

“I think that would have a very draconian effect and that should be avoided in my personal view.”

Sources said the proposals will be reviewed by Legco's housing panel next month and are still subject to change.

It’s believed the authority hopes to bring a bill to Legco for vetting in April."

Officers also took away computers and boxes of materials from his office. 

Sources said the investigation was to do with his former deputy at the institute, Chung Kim-wah, who was put on the national security wanted list last month. 

Ahead of the Executive Council meeting, Lee said professional bodies have nothing to worry about if they have no intention to break the law, saying the security laws clearly define what constitutes an offence.

""If professional organisations don't have any intention to endanger national security, they just need to follow their own work process, their ethics, their code of conduct in carrying on with their business, and that will be fine,"" he said.

""It's stated clearly in the law which sorts of acts constitute offences. And then each time, in every operation, the law enforcement agency will explain clearly what sorts of acts constitute the offence of endangering national security.""

The chief executive stressed that officers will get to the bottom of every case in accordance with the law.

Meanwhile, sources said the wife and son of Chung Kim-wah were taken to the police station to assist with the investigation.

Immigration Tower is earmarked for redevelopment, with the building to be used for conventions and commercial use. 

Before the weekly Executive Council meeting, Lee said Lam's move will be temporary and will ensure the proper use of government resources.

""The buildings that have been vacated, we should make good use of them. That is why we're now renovating, so as to allow the former chief executive to move in.""

The remarks came as Professor Justin Lin, former chief economist and senior vice president at the World Bank, spoke to reporters during the 18th edition of the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong, following a luncheon speech.

Noting that China's economy was experiencing a slowdown, declining from earlier annual growth rates of around nine percent to now about five percent, Lin said that was still about a couple of percentage points higher than the US, which saw its economy expand at around 2.7 percent for 2024.

Lin said that if such a trajectory continued, the Chinese economy would be able to surpass the US as the world's largest between 2030 and 2035.

Separately, Lin dismissed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs, one week ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.

""We hope Trump will be reasonable, because to charge 60 percent of tariff rates on China, or 25 percent of tariffs on other countries, I don't think that is good for the US, certainly, that's not good for the world [either],"" he said. 

""We have no control over the trade policies from the US. But if the US is unreasonable, we should be reasonable. And if we maintain togetherness, I think we will be able to weather through any challenges,"" he added.

With exports outpacing imports, China's trade surplus grew to US$104.84 billion.

At a government press conference in Beijing on Monday, General Administration of Customs deputy head Wang Lingjun said that China's foreign trade growth in 2024 was relatively fast among major economies in the world.

 ""China has become a major trading partner of more than 150 countries and regions, and the country's circle of friends in foreign trade is getting larger,"" Wang said.

The official said that the structure of import and export products had also been continuously optimised and upgraded last year, with high-tech products reporting good growth numbers and a boom in new types of trade such as cross-border e-commerce.

China's exports are likely to remain strong in the near-term, said Huang Zichun of Capital Economics, as businesses try to “front-run” potentially higher tariffs.

轉型計劃為退役運動員安排在職培訓機會，例如學習電腦應用、影片剪輯、調解技巧等，並提供進修資助。王瑋駿說，計劃讓他轉型更順利，下一步期望加入紀律部隊，又認為計劃讓他知道運動員不單只有一條出路、只能做教練，原來可在很多不同範疇工作。

退役運動員轉型計劃自2018年推出以來，至今為超過140名退役運動員提供資助。截至2023至24年度，政府就計劃累計撥款已超過1.3億元，2024至25年度再為計劃預留約3500萬元經常開支。當局期望為退役運動員的長遠事業發展奠定基礎，並透過資助學校和體育機構聘請退役運動員，協助推廣體育運動，以及發掘和培育具潛質的體育人才。

US markets fall after jobs figures feed rate worries,2025-01-11 07:09,"US markets declined on Friday following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, indicating potential slower interest rate cuts by the Fed this year.

The 10-year Treasury note yield increased, then moderated, after the Department of Labor reported 256,000 jobs added in December and a lower unemployment rate. Investors perceived this as a sign of the Fed's slower interest rate reductions. January is expected to be volatile due to interest rate concerns and earnings reports. Apple and Nvidia shares dropped 2.4% and 3.0% respectively.",2025-01-16 16:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1787052-20250111.htm,"US markets finished lower on Friday, after a strong employment report fuelled expectations the central bank might make fewer interest rate cuts this year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.6 percent to 41,938.45, and the S&P 500 Index fell 1.5 percent to 5,827.04.

The Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 1.6 percent to 19,161.63.

The slide across major indexes came after a Department of Labor report showed the world's biggest economy adding 256,000 jobs in December.

This defied expectations of a slowdown in job growth, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1 percent as well.

Following the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note shot up, before moderating its gains.

Investors took the better-than-expected labour market figures ""as a sign"" that the Federal Reserve would be slower in reducing interest rates, said Sam Stovall of CFRA.

While the Fed has started cutting rates last year, after the Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers have been balancing this with progress in lowering inflation sustainably.

""January will continue to be a volatile month,"" Stovall said, citing interest rate worries and traders' focus on earnings reports.

According to the CME FedWatch tool, the market sees a 97 percent chance that the Fed holds rates steady at its next policy meeting.

Among individual companies, Apple shed 2.4 percent and Nvidia shares fell 3.0 percent. (AFP)"
"US hiring beats expectations, unemployment edges down",2025-01-10 22:47,"US job gains exceeded expectations in December with 256,000 new hires, lowering the unemployment rate to 4.1%. Wage growth also increased. However, President-elect Trump's inauguration could bring uncertainty due to his plans for tariffs and immigration policies affecting the labor force.",2025-01-16 16:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1787027-20250110.htm,"US job gains soared past expectations in December, according to government data released on Friday, in a sign that the labour market remains healthy just shortly before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration this month.

Hiring in the world's biggest economy was 256,000 last month, up from a revised 212,000 in November, said the Labour Department.

The jobless rate crept down to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent.

The latest report marks a solid end to 2024 for the jobs market, which has held up in the face of elevated interest rates, allowing consumers to continue spending.

But Trump's return to the White House this month could bring uncertainty.

He has pledged to raise tariffs on imports and deport undocumented immigrants – many of whom are a part of the US labour force including in areas like agriculture.

In December, average hourly earnings picked up 0.3 percent from the month before to US$35.69.

From a year ago, wages were up 3.9 percent.
