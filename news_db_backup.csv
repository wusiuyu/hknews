Authorities will in the first half of this year call on insurers to invest at least 100 billion yuan (US$13.75 billion) of long-term funds into stocks, China Securities Regulatory Commission head Wu Qing said at a press conference.

The regulator will encourage both state-owned and commercial insurers to invest 30 percent of new annual premiums in A-shares, and encourage mutual funds to increase their A-share holdings' tradable market value by at least 10 percent annually over the next three years, Wu said.

The plan also involves guiding mutual fund managers to increase equity funds under their management, cut fund sales fee and promote the development of exchange-traded fund products.

The CSI300 blue-chip index advanced 1.47 percent shortly after open on Thursday while the Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.62 percent. The Hang Seng Index similarly gained more than one percent.

On Wednesday, the country's financial authorities signalled they would encourage medium- and long-term funds into the capital market to further stabilise stock performance.
   
The document, jointly released by the office of the Central Financial Work Commission, as well as five government departments, stressed attracting funds from commercial insurance, national social security and basic pension funds.

Annuity funds, public funds, and other medium- to long-term capital funds were also expected to increase their stock market investments, it said.

The plan aims to increase the proportion and stability of A-share investment in the portfolios of commercial insurance companies, and improve the investment management mechanism of the national social security fund and the basic pension insurance fund.
   
The performance of state-owned insurance companies will be assessed over a cycle of more than three years. 

For the national social security and basic pension funds, the evaluation periods will be over five years and over three years, respectively.

Authorities have been intensifying policy support to prop up share prices as the world's second-largest economy navigates deflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions.

They introduced swap and re-lending schemes totalling 800 billion yuan for stock purchases in September as well as guidelines on market capitalisation management to encourage companies to improve shareholder returns. (Xinhua/Reuters)"

Flights as usual until Feb 5: Greater Bay Airlines,2025-01-23 12:14,"Greater Bay Airlines CEO Liza Ng apologized for canceling 128 flights due to delayed aircraft delivery and plane inspections, affecting 5,500 passengers. She admitted poor communication and customer service. An aviation expert explained that airlines often sell tickets for new aircraft before delivery due to financial reasons. Lawmaker Perry Yiu suggested the airline review its flight scheduling and destinations due to lack of flexibility with only eight planes. The airline is considering ending flights to Seoul due to unsatisfactory performance.",2025-01-23 12:45,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1788792-20250123.htm,"The CEO of Greater Bay Airlines on Thursday said only flights after February 5 will be hit by a string of cancellations and Lunar New Year services will not be affected.

Liza Ng apologised on a Commercial Radio programme for the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.

The move has been blamed on a delay in the arrival of new aircraft and planned inspections of planes.

Ng admitted that the airline could have done better at informing those customers affected.

""Because we notified all 5,500 passengers about the cancellations at the same time, by doing so, they will definitely be nervous as it will affect their trip,"" she said.

""When they called us, our staff might not have been able to pick up their calls immediately, making them more anxious. In this case, our customer service didn't handle the incident too well.""

Ng said the airline has boosted manpower and will look at setting up more communication channels for keeping customers informed of developments. 

Meanwhile, an academic who specialises in aviation transport told RTHK's Hong Kong Today programme that it's usual practice for airlines to start selling tickets for flights involving new aircraft that have yet to be delivered. 

Achim Czerny, a professor at Polytechnic University's department of logistics and maritime studies, said buying new planes is a massive investment and the aircraft must be fully utilised as quickly as possible. 

""The aircraft deliveries, the airline business is a relatively complex business, and the performance of an airline depends on many players along the supply chain, for instance, aircraft manufacturers,"" he added.

""And that's certainly something that's not entirely under the control of the airline.""

Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu told RTHK it is crucial that Greater Bay Airlines reviews its flight scheduling, as well as the destinations it flies to.

He said the airline only has a fleet of eight planes and this means there isn't much flexibility to make temporary adjustments.

""After the airline opened new routes, the changes in local environment, political situation, or all kinds of negative news will affect the overall passenger traffic. These are unpredictable,"" he said.

""To be honest, it's also challenging for the airline, as well as the tourism sector, because a destination that used to be a popular tourist hotspot might have drastic changes.""

The airline said this week that it is considering ending its flights to Seoul because of an unsatisfactory performance."

公會認為本港的財政狀況仍可視為穩健及相對穩定，因整體財政具實力，擁有超過4萬億港元的外匯基金資產，當中包括財政儲備、財政赤字與本地生產總值比率相對為低，於2023年約為3.3%、2024年本地生產總值預計為2.5% 。

公會認為本港未來需要增加政府收入及控制公共開支，建議在短中期增加收入方面，可向進入指定香港管制站的所有私人及公共地面交通工具，收取基建通行費，薪俸稅及個人入息課稅標準稅率兩級制，可將較高一級的標準税率，由16%提高至16.5%，並提高住宅物業租賃的印花税。

公會又建議檢討政府開支，公共開支應優先用於可惠及社會、帶動增長的領域，例如房屋、醫療、教育、福利和數碼化。至於主要基建項目的融資，除發債外，政府亦應考慮公私營合作機會，並探討定期檢討道路收費水平 。"

阿莫林表示，面對國際形勢新變化，巴中作為新興大國，可以在維護世界和平、應對氣候變化等方面進一步加強合作，發揮更大作用。巴西和中國就烏克蘭危機達成的六點共識具重要意義，要抓住時機，進一步發揮好和平之友小組作用。"

網絡安全及科技罪案調查科警司陳純青說，過往較大額的電郵騙案損失，大多牽涉騙徒假冒受害人的上級或重要生意夥伴，企業員工對公司內部發出的訊息，以及牽涉與公司生意夥伴往來的電郵警覺性較低。

警方聯同網絡安全公司在過去連續兩年舉行釣魚電郵演習，向參與的機構員工發出模擬釣魚攻擊的電郵，最新一次在去年8月至12月進行的演習，在216間參與機構中，超過77%的機構員工，曾點擊最少一封釣魚電郵 ，另有330人曾輸入個人資料，當中點擊率最高是模擬公司人事部發出的問卷調查。

From January to May last year, COSH and the University of Hong Kong polled 5,600 people, of whom 2,600 were smokers. 

Researchers found that nearly half of smokers used flavoured cigarettes, with around 40 percent of teenagers in the poll moderately to severely addicted. 

Henry Tong, the council’s chairman, said flavoured cigarettes give a false impression to young people that they are less harmful.

“The flavours, which might include mint, strawberry, or even alcohol-tasting flavours, are attractive to young people. They cover up the unpleasant smell and unpleasant feeling caused by traditional cigarettes,” he said.

Last June, health officials announced plans to ban e-cigarettes, flavoured tobacco and lighting up while in a queue. But there is no timeline for the legislation yet.

Tong urged the government to table the amendments to the Legislative Council as soon as possible.

He also brushed off the possible impact on the tourism sector and bar industry if the ban takes effect.

“Usually the economic impact of tobacco control has been exaggerated. We believe that better tobacco control in Hong Kong would attract more businesses and help the economy,” he said.

Tong noted that bars and restaurants saw revenues increase by 30 percent within two years after the indoor smoking ban was introduced in 2007."

During a Legislative Council session on Wednesday, constitutional affairs minister Erick Tsang said the government understands the concerns. 

""The government is studying on how to appropriately adjust the legislative amendment proposals, e.g. whether to effect the legislative amendments by phases, thereby reducing the possible effect on business sectors; and how to suitably determine the amount of administrative fines, ensuring they are set at an acceptable level while not losing deterrent effect,"" he said.

Tsang told lawmakers there were 217 data breaches last year, a rise of nearly 30 percent from 2023.

Meanwhile, Election Committee lawmaker Carmen Kan asked whether the government could introduce a ""shared responsibility"" system when it comes to scams.

Kan said under such a system, various parties such as financial institutions, telecommunication and media firms would have to fork out compensation for scam victims if the companies were deemed to have failed in their responsibilities.

In response, financial services undersecretary Joseph Chan said a similar concept of shared responsibility over unauthorised transactions is already covered in existing laws."

The recommendation was part of a comprehensive set of 31 improvements proposed by the office following its investigation into the government's efforts to combat the abuse of public housing resources.

Chan said alongside screening existing tenants, preventing abuse at the source through rigorous vetting can significantly minimise misuse, adding that a new mechanism can make the process more cost-efficient and task effective.  

""In the past, it cost almost HK$640 for each verification. With the intervention of my office through this investigation, the Housing Authority and the Housing Society have devised a new mechanism by which both organisations will submit these tenants' information or declaration by batches to the Land Registry and use a computerised system to verify the information,"" he said.

""This has significantly reduced the cost for such verification process from HK$640 per case down to HK$4 per case.""

Other recommendations include developing specific incentive schemes for the staff of property service agents and security contractors to encourage their participation in combating abuse and enhancing communication with mainland and Macau authorities to obtain information about tenants' property ownership in those regions. 

The watchdog commended the authorities for successfully reclaiming over 7,000 flats over abuse or violations of tenancy agreements, but Chan pointed out that the highest prosecution rate in the past seven years was only 4.2 percent in 2024.

He said some tenants were evicted from their units but did not face prosecution for PRH abuse, while the two-year prosecution limit passed for other cases. 

Chan said he hopes that authorities will consider extending the prosecution time limit and imposing heavier penalties.  

The Housing Department (HD) thanked the watchdog for its investigation report, and said they would review and study the recommendations to enhance existing measures and explore new methods to combat abuse.

""We just launched the Report Public Housing Abuse Award on January 15, hoping to gather more accurate intelligence on tenancy abuse for taking action. To strengthen the deterrent effect and gradually reduce the abuse of public housing resources, we are also actively exploring amendments to the Housing Ordinance to criminalise the act of serious tenancy abuse, targeting to have the Bills passed in the Legislative Council in mid-2025,"" a spokesman for the HD said. 

""We hope that capable tenants will surrender their PRH flats so that precious public housing resources can be allocated to those in genuine need, optimising the use of public housing resources."""

Chan said the thriving ecosystem of family offices, private equity funds, wealth and asset management was conducive to connecting wealth with climate transition projects.

He briefed attendees at a luncheon meeting on Hong Kong's latest economic situation and development strategies, highlighting its collaboration with sister cities in the Greater Bay Area.

Chan met the Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Daren Tang, to exchange views on strengthening cooperation in areas such as intellectual property protection and talent training.

The financial secretary also met the United Arab Emirates' foreign trade minister, Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, to discuss bilateral cooperation in finance and trade.

桌球自2009年起成為體院的A級精英項目。根據相關規定，要成為「A級」必須在2010至2030年間最少三屆列為亞運或奧運項目，但桌球自2014年後被剔出亞運，到2030年才重返亞運。換言之，桌球今年4月開始有機會由「A級」降為「B級」。

傅家俊表示，每個運動項目的特質和歷史背景都不同，香港有不少出色的年輕桌球手，如果真的「降級」，政府資助金額會減少七、八成，對運動員的發展有很大影響，希望有關當局酌情處理。"

Trump said that ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle are planning a joint venture called Stargate, which he said would build data centres and create more than 100,000 jobs in the United States.

These companies, along with other equity backers of Stargate, have committed US$100 billion for immediate deployment, with the remaining investment expected to occur over the next four years.

SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison joined Trump at the White House for the launch.

The first of the project's data centres are already under construction in Texas, Ellison said at the press conference. 

Twenty will be built, half-a-million square feet each, he said. The project could power AI that analyses electronic health records and helps doctors care for their patients, Ellison said.

It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was an update to a previously reported venture.

In March 2024, The Information, a technology news website, reported OpenAI and Microsoft were working on plans for a US$100 billion data centre project that would include an artificial intelligence supercomputer, also called ""Stargate"", set to launch in 2028.

The announcement on Trump's second day in office follows the rolling back of former President Joe Biden's executive order on AI, that was intended to reduce the risks that AI poses to consumers, workers and national security.

Oracle shares were up seven per cent on an initial report of the project earlier in the day. Nvidia, Arm Holdings and Dell shares also rose. (Agencies)"

He also criticized China's influence on the Panama Canal.",2025-01-23 12:45,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1788495-20250121.htm,"Chinese stocks and the yuan tentatively rose on Tuesday, with investors relieved that US President Donald Trump did not announce hefty trade tariffs at his inauguration.

Trump returned to the White House on Monday with an ambitious agenda spanning trade reform, immigration, tax cuts and deregulation. He did not target China in his inauguration speech nor did he immediately impose tariffs as previously promised, sparking a relief rally in global stocks and a drop in the dollar.

At the same time, Trump directed federal agencies to ""investigate and remedy"" persistent US trade deficits and unfair trade practices by other countries, and said he might impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on February 1.

“We’re thinking in terms of 25 percent on Mexico and Canada,” Trump said late on Monday night in the Oval Office. “I think February 1.”

Canadian leaders earlier expressed relief the tariffs were not imposed on the first day of Trump taking office.

Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 75 percent of Canada’s exports, which include automobiles and parts, go to the US.

Trump also signed an order on Monday directing agencies to study a host of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation.

These could pave the way for further duties.

He also directed federal agencies to assess China's performance under the Phase 1 trade deal that he signed with Beijing in 2020 during his first term at the White House.

The deal had required China to increase purchases of US exports by US$200 billion over a two-year period, but Beijing failed to meet its targets when the Covid-19 pandemic struck.

Trump's start to his presidency ""is better than I expected,"" said Charles Wang, chairman of Shenzhen Dragon Pacific Capital Management Co.

Yuan Yuwei, founder and chief investment officer of Water Wisdom Asset Management, called Trump's return ""marginally positive"" and expected the new president to be less stringent in his crackdown on China than predecessor Joe Biden, who ""sought to strangle China to death"".

The CSI300 index has dropped roughly five percent since Trump won the election on November 5 with a threat to impose steep tariffs of 60 percent on Chinese goods, but had already rebounded over the past week amid gestures of goodwill between Beijing and Washington.

Meanwhile, Trump, in his inaugural address, repeated his complaint that China was effectively ""operating"" the Panama Canal through its growing presence around the vital waterway, which the United States handed over at the end of 1999.

""We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back,"" Trump said after taking the oath inside the US Capitol.

Panama reacted sharply to Trump's pledge, saying the key inter-oceanic waterway would remain under its control.

""The canal is and will remain Panama's,"" President Jose Raul Mulino said.

Bitcoin reaches new record on Trump comeback,2025-01-20 17:07,"Bitcoin hit a record high of $109,241 on Monday, ahead of Trump's inauguration, due to deregulation expectations.

Bitcoin surged since Trump's election win, reaching $100,000 in early Dec. and has been criticized for dark web use, money laundering, and high energy consumption.",2025-01-23 12:45,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1788326-20250120.htm,"Bitcoin hit a record high above US$109,000 on Monday as Donald Trump, who has signalled plans to deregulate the cryptocurrency sector, prepares to be sworn in as US president.

Bitcoin surged to reach an all-time peak of US$109,241 ahead of Trump's inauguration ceremony, before falling back to US$107,765.

The world's biggest cryptocurrency has soared since Trump won the presidential election in November, with bitcoin surpassing US$100,000 for the first time in early December.

It came after he nominated cryptocurrency backer Paul Atkins to head the US securities regulator, reinforcing optimism the new president will deregulate the sector.

Despite having once branded cryptocurrencies a ""scam"", Trump changed his stance and was a major advocate of them during his election campaign.

Over the weekend, he launched his own cryptocurrency, appropriately called $TRUMP, sparking feverish buying that sent its market capitalisation soaring to several billion dollars.

When bitcoin reached the landmark US$100,000 level, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: ""CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! US$100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!""

Cryptocurrencies have made headlines since their creation, from their extreme volatility to the collapse of several industry giants, foremost among them the FTX exchange platform.

Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 by a person or group writing under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

It was pitched as a way to break free of mainstream financial institutions by establishing a decentralised platform for transactions.

The digital currency is created -- or ""mined"" -- as a reward when powerful computers solve complex problems to validate transactions made on a meddle-proof register known as the blockchain.

Bitcoin has long been criticised for being the currency of choice for making untraceable payments on the so-called dark web, a hidden part of the internet used for criminal activities.

The asset has often come under attack for facilitating money laundering and allowing extortion through ransomware attacks.

Its carbon footprint has also come under scrutiny because mining cryptocurrencies requires huge amounts of energy. (AFP)"

The company has proposed a debt restructuring plan to cut its US$16.4 billion offshore debt by 70%, reaching an ""understanding"" with a lender group.

The court hearing, which was held to measure progress in reaching an agreement with creditors, was then adjourned until May 26 by High Court judge Linda Chan after a request from Country Garden's lawyers to extend the date from May 19.

Country Garden said earlier this month it has proposed to creditors a debt restructuring that would cut its offshore debt worth US$16.4 billion by 70 percent, and it had reached an ""understanding"" with a lender group.

Once China's biggest property developer, Country Garden defaulted on US$11 billion in offshore bonds in late 2023, deepening a debt crisis in the sector that had already experienced defaults by many developers, including China Evergrande Group.

SKorea central bank cuts forecasts due to Yoon crisis,2025-01-20 12:07,"South Korea's central bank lowered its 2025 growth forecast due to political crisis and President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law declaration, which led to economic sentiment contraction. The political turmoil and a plane crash also impacted domestic consumption and investment, causing a decrease in Q4 growth. Yoon, the first South Korean president arrested, is facing insurrection charges and refuses to cooperate with investigators.",2025-01-23 12:45,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1788281-20250120.htm,"South Korea's central bank on Monday said it had slashed its 2025 growth forecast because of the political crisis triggered by President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law last month.

Yoon briefly suspended civilian rule on December 3, sending soldiers to parliament but lawmakers voted the measure down and later impeached the president, who is now being held for a criminal probe on insurrection charges.

He initially resisted arrest and has refused to cooperate with investigators and, when his detention was extended, his die-hard supporters attacked a court building on Sunday.

""The unexpected declaration of martial law in early December, coupled with the ongoing political turmoil and the Jeju Air passenger plane disaster, significantly dampened economic sentiment,"" the Bank of Korea said in a statement.

A Jeju Air Boeing 737-800 crashed on December 29 in southwestern Muan airport, killing 179 people in the worst ever aviation disaster on South Korean soil.

The political turmoil and crash ""led to contractions in domestic consumption and construction investment, likely causing the fourth-quarter growth rate to fall well below the November projection"", the bank said.

""Consumption, which had shown improvement in the third quarter, appeared to weaken again in the fourth quarter,"" it said.

As a result, the bank's Monetary Policy Committee revised down its estimate for the last quarter of 2024, from 2.2 percent to a range of 2.0-2.1 percent.

It had projected 1.9 percent growth for 2025, but ""the forecast has been revised downward to 1.6-1.7 percent"", it said.

""This adjustment is primarily attributed to the impact of political uncertainty triggered by the declaration of martial law last December, which has dampened economic sentiment,"" it said.

""This is estimated to reduce this year's growth rate by approximately 0.2 percentage points, particularly affecting domestic consumption and other areas of domestic demand,"" it added.

Yoon is the first sitting South Korean president ever to be arrested.

With Yoon behind bars, prosecutors are due to formalise a criminal indictment for insurrection.

He could be jailed for life or executed if found guilty.

Yoon refused to attend questioning on Monday, his lawyers said, with the Corruption Investigation Office -- the body in charge of the probe -- saying it was looking at whether to compel him to attend.

Yoon has also been absent from the parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is considering whether to uphold his impeachment.

If that court rules against him, Yoon will formally lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. (AFP)"

IMF raises global growth outlook,2025-01-17 22:27,"Global growth expected to increase slightly to 3.3% this year, remaining below pre-pandemic average. US economy resilient, with growth forecast to 2.7% in 2025. Europe growth expected to increase slightly to 1.0% this year, below pre-pandemic levels.

In an update to its flagship World Economic Outlook report, the International Monetary Fund said it expects global growth to hit 3.3 percent this year, up 0.1 percentage point from its previous forecast in October, and to remain at 3.3 percent in 2026.

""Growth is steady,"" IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters, adding it remained below the average global growth rate in the first two decades of the 21st century of 3.7 percent.

The IMF expects the global inflation rate to continue decelerating, reaching 4.2 percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2026, with prices cooling faster in advanced economies than in emerging markets.

""Among advanced economies, the interesting development here is the strength and resilience and growth of the US economy,"" Gourinchas said, pointing to the IMF's decision to hike its outlook for US growth to 2.7 percent in 2025 and to 2.1 percent in 2026.

""The labour market has been strong, there is strong demand, private demand is robust, there is good confidence,"" he said.

The IMF expects China's growth rate to continue cooling this year to 4.6 percent, up 0.1 percentage point from the October forecast, before easing to 4.5 percent next year.

The slight upgrade was due to the Chinese government's recently announced package of fiscal support to help prop up the economy, amid an ongoing property market slump and uncertainty about trade policy once Donald Trump takes office next week.

The slowdown in growth in the world's second-largest economy is leading to something of a ""rebalancing"" among emerging markets, Gourinchas said, with countries including India -- which the IMF expects to grow by 6.5 percent this year and next -- playing a more important role.

Growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is expected to pick up by less than previously forecast due largely to the effect of oil production cuts by the Opec+ group of oil-producing nations, which includes Saudi Arabia.

One of the risks to the IMF's forecasts is policy uncertainty in the United States, where Trump is preparing to return to the White House and has threatened to unleash tariffs on a host of nations including China.

Still, the economic picture in America stands in stark contrast to the Euro area, where a sharp downgrade for Germany has dampened expectations for a rebound in growth.

The IMF now sees Euro area growth to increase slightly to 1.0 percent this year, and 1.4 percent in 2026, below its October forecasts. (AFP)"
