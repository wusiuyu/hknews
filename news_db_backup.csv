CX offered bonus 'to keep the industry's best people',2024-10-22 17:39,,2024-10-22 17:44,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1775665-20241022.htm,"Cathay Pacific has announced that its employees will receive a bonus equivalent to one month's salary, after the flag carrier said it saw good results this year.

Alex McGowan, Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer on Tuesday said he felt the company has to find ways to keep the best people in the industry.

""Moving forward, of course, we always want to keep our remuneration competitive so that we can attract and retain the best people. We're very pleased, I think, over the course of the last year to have seen our turnover rates, our attrition rates, particularly in our pilot community, to come down to levels that we haven't seen for decades, not even pre-pandemic,"" he said.

""But pilot turnover is now at historic lows, and I hope that that's testimony to the fact that our pilots enjoy working for Cathay and the opportunities that working for Cathay provides.""

The group had in August posted a net profit of HK$3.6 billion for the first half of the year, but that was down 15 percent compared with the same period in 2023. It recorded a 14 percent on-year rise in revenue to HK$49.6 billion for the same period.

McGowan was speaking to reporters after the celebration ceremony for the order of up to 150 aircraft with Airbus, during which the group's CEO, Ronald Lam said the expansion and modernisation of the Cathay fleet come as Hong Kong International Airport prepares to open its three-runway system at the end of the year.

""From 2026, we'll start to take delivery of the second order of our narrow-body passenger aircraft, which will consist of A321neo as well as A320neo into both the Cathay Pacific, as well as HK Express fleet,"" he said. 

""Then from 2027, we'll start to take delivery of A350 freighter to expand our cargo fleet so that we can continue to strengthen Hong Kong's number one air cargo hub status. From 2028 onwards, we'll start to take delivery of A330 new aircraft, the new generation A330,"" Lam added."

隱瞞擁有本港物業公屋女住戶判囚30天　涉案碩門邨單位被收回,2024-10-22 17:23,,2024-10-22 17:43,local,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1775681-20241022.htm,"一名公屋女住戶因在申請公屋時沒有申報擁有香港住宅物業，違反《房屋條例》，合共被判監禁30天，涉案的碩門邨公屋單位已被房屋署收回。

這名女住戶申請公屋時，在2018及2019年向房屋署遞交的兩份申報表中，沒有申報她擁有香港住宅物業，從而獲配一個碩門邨公屋單位。其後當局調查揭發，她於案發時擁有一個元朗區的住宅物業，並不符合申請公屋的資格。

這名女住戶就申請公屋一事明知而作出虛假陳述，違反《房屋條例》而被檢控，較早前在沙田裁判法院被裁定罪名成立，昨日被判刑。裁判官考慮到案情的嚴重性及涉及寶貴的公屋資源，認為不適合判處社會服務令，因此判處她兩項控罪各監禁20天，其中10同期執行，即共監禁30天。

房屋署提醒所有公屋居民及申請人，必須如實申報入息及資產。在申請公屋時，因明知而向房委會作出虛假陳述，即觸犯《房屋條例》。一經法庭定罪，最高可被判罰款5萬元及監禁6個月，其公屋申請會被取消，而已入住的公屋單位亦會被房屋署收回。"

甯漢豪稱介紹北都區及交椅洲人工島展館需「得體」,2024-10-22 17:16,,2024-10-22 17:28,local,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1775677-20241022.htm,"政府計劃在灣仔北海濱用地、演藝學院對出興建新大型展館，介紹北部都會區及交椅洲人工島基建，預計造價6億至7億元。有立法會議員關注造價及會否利用現有展城館，發展局局長甯漢豪回應，展館需要「得體」，讓市民及世界知道香港的發展，強調興建成本，與現時公營設施樓面建築成本相若。

在立法會發展事務委員會，民建聯梁熙關注，會否考慮改建原有中環展城館或租用甲級商廈興建展館，以節省資源，騰出原有計劃用地發展與經濟或旅遊相關設施。

甯漢豪回應，現有展城館規模細，佔地約900平方米、樓面約3000平米；現時構思中用地佔約5000平方米、樓面達8000至1萬平方米。新的展館將介紹北部都會區及交椅洲人工島兩個大型發展項目，如果日後或會再有大型項目，也需要有個「得體」場地，若租用商廈，相信不符合有關意向。

她解釋，不在北都興建有關新展館，是基於若2027年可建成新展館，屆時北都仍有很多地方正在發展，即仍會有不少建築用地。而灣仔選址附近有會展、展城館等，可產生協同效應，有助各界看到香港發展全貌。"

Bidding for the stalls – one of which would have cost more than HK$500,000 before the Covid pandemic – saw two of the successful offers reaching the base price of HK$124,700. The amount for the most expensive stall reached HK$182,000, while the fourth stall was sold at HK$2,000 less than that amount.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, which is in charge of the auction, said the prices reflected the current market situation.

The top bidder, surnamed Ng, said there were just a handful of bidders this time around, compared to more than a dozen in the preceding year.

""I will probably earn less of a profit compared to last year. But it's still worth a shot,"" he told reporters.

""The bidding was less competitive. Because I know some fellow snack sellers are having a tough time making a living out there. So they didn't join the bidding.""

A florist who successfully acquired a stall at the fair also thought the competition for flower stalls was not too fierce, because some sellers ended up with a lot of unsold stock last year.

Auctions for other stalls, including those for dry goods, will be held in the next two days.

The fair will feature nearly 400 stalls at Victoria Park for a week starting from January 23."

3名被告分別是藝能工程有限公司項目經理吳凱瑩及林志華，以及廣域策劃有限公司的項目經理梁耀祖。3人被控一項串謀詐騙罪及交替控罪的欺詐罪，於前年5月19日至7月25日，串謀詐騙康文署經理，即在兩個負重表中虛報多項設備的重量，誘使康文署經理容許演唱會舉行。

鄭宇軒解釋製作團隊向藝能提供設計，藝能回覆是否可行，吳凱瑩及林志華是藝能的「對口人」，雙方接觸較多，梁耀祖在會議上負責以電腦打開設計圖，商討設計可行性。

另一名證人、舞台設計師周淑貞亦有出庭，她在作供時同樣確認演唱會最初打算懸掛12塊LED屏幕，又說有印象在另一會議上，負責供應屏幕的公司即場提供屏幕連鐵框架重量，為大約500公斤。

周淑貞又指，被告吳凱瑩較常與製作團隊聯絡，是「溝通橋樑」；被告林志華較多技術上的意見，例如懸掛裝置會否太重；被告梁耀祖負責在會議上用電腦計算粗略的重量。"

上訴方陳詞指，案發時現場情況混亂，案發過程僅得1秒，認為原審法官難以藉1秒混亂的現場片段，去判斷被告當時打算搶槍。上訴方指，當時被告動作可能只是自然反應下想推開警槍，在警員開槍後已經轉身想離開。

上訴庭法官彭寶琴引述被告被捕後，在警誡下稱「我想由警察手中搶返個白衫男子」，與上訴方說法不吻合，被告警誡下隻字未提要推開警槍，原審法官何以「要無中生有作一些不吻合警誡的事」。法官彭偉昌亦指，警員擎槍時，被告仍然上前，上訴方不能代表被告在律師席上作供。"

An attack by a hacker in March resulted in a breach of members’ personal information, including ID card numbers, passport details, phone numbers, photos and addresses. 

The privacy watchdog said the SCAA accidentally exposed its servers to the internet, which the hacker took advantage of to infiltrate the network and launch the attacks. 

The association was also accused of lacking a proper detection system for attacks. The watchdog said the attacker made over 20,000 attempts to log in to one of the servers for four hours, without being interrupted.

The PCPD said the same hacker had successfully installed malicious software on the sports organisation's system two years ago, although no data was stolen at the time.

Privacy Commissioner Ada Chung criticised the SCAA for failing to spot that attack until the data leak this year, saying it didn’t carry out regular checks or risk assessments
 
“The association, as a long-established sports association holding a significant amount of personal data, should be vigilant about cybersecurity and data security. I am very disappointed that the association failed to implement effective information system security measures to safeguard members' personal data prior to the incident. 

“I believe that if the association had deployed sufficient detection measures or alert tools back in 2022, there would have been a good chance of detecting the malicious activities at the early stage of the [March] hacking attack,” Chung said.

The PCPD ruled that the SCAA violated the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, and an enforcement notice was issued to the association to fix the issue. 

In response, the SCAA said it acknowledged the investigation findings and will adhere to the PCPD’s enforcement notice.

It said it imposed a series of remedial measures after the incident in question, and pledged to prevent similar incidents from happening again. 

Separately, the PCPD said it has observed a concerning rise in data breaches involving non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and schools.

The watchdog received 61 data breach notifications from schools and NGOs last year, an increase of about 1.5 times compared to 2022.

Chung said NGOs and schools often hold a lot of sensitive personal data, making them attractive targets for hackers.

She urged them to stay vigilant against cyber attacks and bolster their data security resources."

The end of a grace period means violators can now face fines of up to HK$100,000.

Talking to reporters ahead of an Executive Council meeting, Lee said the aim is to bring about behavioural change rather than punish people.

""I am glad to see that there are good results in the catering sector, in the building management sector, in the hotel sector, which indicated that there has been a lot of disposable cutlery saved as a result of this plastic-free culture we want to build,"" he said.

Lee said the government needs to consider a range of factors before moving on to the next phase of the plastics ban which will cover takeaway items, among other things.

""We will, first of all prepare society and businesses, particular when we decide as to how we will go to the next stage, i.e. whether there are sufficient alternative products available in the market for society to use smoothly into the next stage,"" he said.

""And more importantly affordable prices. Because what we learnt from the first phase is despite the fact that we all subscribe to this plastic-free culture, it is an important change of behaviour, we also want businesses to be able to go through the process in a smooth manner and people will be paying an affordable price for all these changes of behaviour."""

林定國在前海出席華語律師大會致辭說，律政司非常重視涉外法律人才的培養工作，已於本月初成立香港國際法律人才培訓辦公室，並將根據施政報告公布的計劃，在今年底前，正式啓動成立香港國際法律人才培訓學院，開展能力建設和推出有關培訓項目。

施政報告2024｜「簡樸房」登記制度擬簡化　鼓勵業主盡快登記,2024-10-22 12:08,,2024-10-22 12:30,local,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1775623-20241022.htm,"施政報告提出以立法處理劏房問題，提出以「簡樸房」逐步取締不合標準劏房。房屋局局長何永賢表示，「簡樸房」最快明年底起，展開登記，登記後可享有寬限期，每次成功獲批認證有效期 5年。

何永賢接受報章訪問表示，政府有意簡化登記制度，業主只需登記姓名、地址、單位面積、屋內設施等基本資料，從而鼓勵更多業主盡快登記。寬限期內，業主可以透過測量師及工程師等合資格專業人士糾正及核實，當局取得文件後，就會盡快審批，並以抽查方式派人覆核，批出的認證期暫定 5年有效。至於會否延長寬限期，當局可研究按個案審批，例如考慮是否出現業主不能控制的因素等。

執法方面，何永賢提到，政府估計有兩次重要的執法時間，分別是登記期和寬限期結束，登記期預料最快2026年底或2027年初，政府要針對拒絕接受登記及繼續私下經營劏房的業主；寬限期結束大概在2028年，將視乎寬限期的時間，當局會對未能妥善糾正的業主作出警告，而政府會以風險為本、先易後難的方式處理違規個案，優先對環境差劣、劏房數量較多的大廈執法。

對於「簡樸房」的標準，何永賢提到，有專業學會提出面積不少於10平方米，而政黨及劏房關注團體就建議7平方米，政府最終選擇8平方米，因為如提升至10平方米，會有超過半數劏房單位違規，造成市場恐慌。當局是希望避免過多劏房不合規格。

對於外界有意見關注規管劏房有可能推高租金，何永賢表示，按政府推算，未來有足夠土地和房屋供應滿足現有輪候公屋的需求，認為即使撇除不合「簡樸房」規格的三成劏房單位，在當局有空間應付需求下，估計劏房租金大幅攀升的機會不大，甚至有機會下跌。"

何漢威表示，對於法例的半年適應期，食肆大致接受和配合，巿民亦問題不大。但如果巿民只是由即棄膠餐具轉用紙飲管等餐具，都是即棄餐具，並非立法原意，他建議巿民使用自備餐具。

對於法例的第二階段，杯蓋及食物容器等都不可使用塑膠，何漢威表示，政府曾提及會於2025年實施，認為如果有足夠時間讓業界習慣，應不太困難，而現時部份集團式餐廳正在實行。他認為可以有半年適應期，期望明年首季可以實施。"

黃傑龍於本台節目《千禧年代》表示，要求即棄餐具的食客已大幅減少，多數食都是顧客提出才提供或要另外收費等。

身兼環境運動委員會主席的黃傑龍認為，部分人士因為工作關係，不方便自携餐具，但如果買外賣到辦公室進食的話，部份人會用自備餐具，這亦做到立法原意。而近半年來，市場上可供選擇的即棄餐具大增，當然價錢和質素都有不同，但要轉用合法即棄餐具的難度不高。

至於法例的第二階段何時實施，黃傑龍認為，難度較大，部分食物容器質量仍未算合適，他舉例指出，手搖飲品的賣相會直接影響生意，所以他認為如果社會及業界未準備好，希望可以給予有更多時間準備。"

A new service model, used to treat BPH, has been in use since late 2022, and has treated about 250 patients since then.

Ng Chi-fai, a cluster service coordinator at the New Territories East Cluster, said a minimally invasive procedure had been adopted, allowing patients to be treated outside the operating room.

""We are using water steam to heat up the prostate tissue, to make the prostate tissue die, and it will shrink the size of the prostate, or using some small pins to compress on the prostate tissue so that the prostate lumen, the channel, can be widened. Therefore, the patient can void better,"" he said.

""Traditionally, we are doing this procedure in the operating theatre. In our new surface model, we are using local anaesthesia, and we also perform the procedure in our day treatment centre.""

Ng added that patients normally have to stay at the hospital for two days if they undergo the traditional surgery, but this is unnecessary with the upgraded service model.

""Patients have the procedure done within 15 to 30 minutes, and then after we observe them for maybe one or two hours, they will be discharged,"" he said, adding that whole process is completed within half a day.

Ng said the new service model enabled them to double the number of patients being treated, and the waiting time for patients had fallen to four months, from 12 months originally.

Arabic learning drive a ticket to success: scholar,2024-10-21 16:45,"The article discusses a debate over the government's suggestion for taxi drivers to learn basic Arabic for better communication with Middle Eastern tourists.

Officials clarified that drivers aren't expected to converse in Arabic but should provide information in the language. Refai advocates for learning simple phrases like ""hello"" and ""thank you."" Despite the government's initiative and the Arab world's importance as trading partners, there's been a decline in Arabic language learning in Hong Kong since Covid.",2024-10-22 12:30,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1775456-20241021.htm,"A misunderstanding over the government’s apparent ambitions to require taxi drivers learn Arabic has been a hot topic of discussion in recent days, and has even been a target of derision by some in the trade.

But the head of the University of Hong Kong’s Arabic programme, Amjad Refai, says this is actually a great idea for Hongkongers – and learning Arabic isn’t as difficult as some may think.

Chief Executive John Lee had said in his latest Policy Address that relevant sectors should provide service information in Arabic to lure in more Middle Eastern tourists, but officials have since clarified that this doesn’t mean cabbies will be expected to learn to converse in Arabic.

Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Algernon Yau said on Monday that they just want more information to be made available in Arabic to help travellers find taxis or Muslim-friendly facilities more easily.

Transport chief Lam Sai-hung also said it would be a good thing if drivers could learn a few simple Arabic phrases such as greetings.

Refai agrees that learning to say hello: أهلاً (ahlaan) or thank you: شكراً (shkraan) isn’t the toughest thing in the world.

“I don't believe there is an easy language or there is a difficult language. There is no such thing,” he said.

The academic, who has written a textbook for people learning Arabic as a second language, says while learning a language that’s very different from the mother tongue of students makes things challenging, it’s far from insurmountable.

“We need to make an easy approach for the students,” Refai said. “I don't think Arabic is a difficult language – it's different… new… so students may face challenges and they need to [make] efforts to be familiar with it.”

Refai said more and more universities and even private schools here have been offering Arabic courses in recent years, and there was a spike in the number of students learning the language between 2016 and 2019.

However, he says since Covid hit, there has been a “shocking” decline in student numbers in Hong Kong in contrast to the mainland, where people seem to be more aware of the advantages of learning a language spoken in countries that are becoming increasingly important trading partners both to the territory and the nation.

“I was expecting that everyone will try to compete to learn Arabic and the numbers are increasing but I don't see this on ground,” Refai lamented.

“In [the] mainland for decades we know the importance of Arabic language and nearly all universities –  even the regional universities – teach Arabic as majors, and a lot of students are studying Arabic on the mainland because they can see the potential of the Arab world.”

He says the advent of artificial intelligence may have affected peoples’ appetite for learning new languages, as AI makes translation and communications much easier. But he’s still shocked that people here aren’t seizing the career opportunities that would be afforded by learning Arabic.

“It's still a decent amount of people are learning Arabic, but less than the years I'm talking about – 2016 and 2019 – which has not only surprised me, it shocked me actually, because the Hong Kong and China governments, as part of the initiative of the New Belt and Road, are extending hands towards the Arab world.”

He says the best way to learn a new language is via in-person classes, where teachers can best use the human element to communicate face-to-face with their students."

Speaking at a media preview for the event, the council's Deputy Executive Director, Sophia Chong, said more than 20 percent of vendors would be bringing hard liquor to the fair, which takes place from November 7 to 9.

""People may be drinking medium or low-level [spirits], and they now can have more room to drink good quality [spirits] with a reasonable price,"" he said.

The administration on Monday said the family-friendly policy is expected to start in April.

At a Legco public service panel meeting, several unionist lawmakers asked why officials have decided on three days and then only for parents of children under three. 

They asked whether more days off could be offered and whether the leave could be extended to parents of older children.

Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Kwok Wai-keung said Singapore offers six days of childcare leave.

Civil service chief Ingrid Yeung said officials are already striking a balance between several factors, adding that the scheme will be reviewed after implementation.

""We roll out government-friendly measures for government workers, but then there's also a need for manpower, and operational needs for departments. We have to be prudent with this new measure,"" she said.

""At that preschool age below three, children usually stay at home. They need more care at home. That's why we set the threshold at three years old.""

Finance sector lawmaker Ronick Chan and former minister Lai Tung-kwok of the New People's Party asked whether civil servants could be given a day off for their birthday, with Lai saying this would provide a morale boost to those who don't have children.

Yeung said officials will consider the suggestion, but providing leave does come with a financial burden for the government."
'Function over price when eateries buy cutlery',2024-10-21 14:21,"The Supply Ching Company, which provides wooden and bamboo cutlery to restaurants, noted that functionality has become more important than price for eateries. Initially, their products were 20-30% more expensive than plastic ones, but prices have dropped due to economies of scale.

Yip also observed a decrease in one-time cutlery use and an increase in reliance on sustainable options, assuring no sales worry.",2024-10-22 12:30,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1775450-20241021.htm,"A company that supplies wooden and bamboo forks, knives and spoons to restaurants on Monday said price has become a far less significant factor for eateries when making purchases of cutlery. 

“Maybe I can use the knife as an example. At the beginning people are just concerned about the price. They choose a wooden knife and fork but because of the functionality of the wood it cannot cut like a harder steak. So people now choose the bamboo fork and knife which can be used to cut the steak easily,” Alvis Yip, founder of Supply Ching Company said. 

He said his products were initially about 20 percent to 30 percent more expensive than the plastic ones, but his prices have now dropped by about 10 percent, benefiting from economies of scale.

Yip was one of four suppliers invited by the Environmental Protection Department to showcase their products to the press six months ago. 

During the event, another supplier demonstrated how its knife and fork can be used to cut steak, but the fork snapped during two attempts.

Asked whether the issue affected his sales in any way, Yip said it actually gave customers more confidence in his products. 

“At the beginning we were concerned about that incident, that will it affect the reputation of sustainable food packaging. But after that event it kind of benefits us because while the citizens are often laughing at the presentation, the restaurants are actually more concerned about the functionality. That event created chances or situations for us to explain more of our products' details to our customers,” he said.

Yip said he also noticed a significant drop in reliance on one-off cutlery as people adapt to more sustainable options, but stressed he is not worried about his sales. 

“It’s like that restaurants are preparing for, for example, 10,000 sets of cutlery because they are using the assumption from plastic cutlery, but then they end up just using 5,000 for a month. So monthly usage can drop by 50 percent,” he said. 

“But I can draw more customers using our quality and new designs and new materials by increasing our functionalities… We will just have some good quality supplies left in the market in the end.”"

Single-use plastics ban running smoothly: EPD,2024-10-21 11:50,"The Environmental Protection Department reports a smooth implementation of the city's single-use plastics ban, with significant reductions in disposable cutlery usage (30M fewer sets) and plastic reduction in the hotel sector by 80%.

In an interview with RTHK, deputy director of the department Kenneth Cheng said 80 percent of customers of chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have chosen not to offer any takeaway utensils.

The department estimates that 30 million fewer sets of disposable cutlery than usual have been given out by the catering sector since the ban took effect in April, Cheng said.  

He praised the hotel sector for being “ahead of the international trend” by reducing its use of plastics by 80 percent over the past six months. 

Cheng said shopping malls and office buildings have stopped giving out disposable umbrella bags and few people have been using glow sticks or party hats during festive events, showing that a culture of reducing plastic is gradually developing. 

The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules now face fines of up to HK$100,000, but Cheng said the department will prioritise education over punishment. 

“We can see that the culture of reducing plastic is progressing. We don't believe that heavily penalising businesses is the right way to implement this culture. Instead, we think it should be achieved through promotion and education. But of course we will enforce the law after the adaptation period, but the focus will be on primary suppliers,” he said.

“We inspected the selling points in the past and identified those that have not yet met the requirements. We will inspect them again and will issue a written warning to them if they haven’t improved. We will give them 10 more days to make the necessary changes.”

Asked when the second phase of the ban, which will cover items including takeaway plastic lunch boxes and cups, will be introduced, Cheng said there is currently no specific timetable. 

He said the move will depend on factors such as social acceptance, available replacements and international trends."

""We now hope to see if we can better utilise the space of the cruise terminal. For example, can we make use of the rooftop area? It's currently a park. Is there anything else we can do there? How can we promote more convention and exhibition activities?"" Yeung told a radio programme. 

Asked about Singapore receiving more cruise ships than Hong Kong in July and August, the minister said it's not a fair comparison.

""Traditionally, Hong Kong's typhoon season runs from May to August. This doesn't exist in some places, for example Singapore. So, comparing cruise ship numbers in July and August is not the best,"" he said. 

""It's not about how many typhoons we have in July and August, but because cruise lines won't take risks in their scheduling during the typhoon season.""

Yeung also said more will be done to develop ""horse racing tourism"" as outlined in the policy blueprint, such as working with the Jockey Club to promote international horse-racing events. 

But he said authorities need to carefully consider whether the current 18-year-old age limit for racegoers would be lowered."

The one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR), which constitutes the benchmark for the most advantageous rates lenders can offer to businesses and households, was cut from 3.35 percent to 3.1 percent. The five-year LPR, the benchmark for mortgage loans, was cut from 3.85 to 3.6 percent. Both rates were last reduced in July and are sitting at all-time lows.

People's Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Pan Gongsheng told a financial forum last week lending rates will decrease by 20 to 25 basis points on October 21.

The PBOC announced cuts to banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the benchmark seven-day reverse repo rate by 20 basis points on September 24, kicking off the most aggressive stimulus since the pandemic.

It also cut the medium-term lending facility rate by 30 basis points last month.

Most new and outstanding loans in China are based on the one-year LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.

Since the September 24 measures, the CSI300 Index has broken records for daily moves and is up more than 14 percent overall.

Data on Friday showed China's economic growth was slightly better than expected in the third quarter, although property investment fell more than 10 percent in the first nine months of the year. Retail sales and industrial production picked up in September.

Officials addressing a press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, and flagged another cut to banks' reserve ratio by the year-end.

Zhang Zhiwei, President and Chief Economist of Pinpoint Asset Management, said Monday's rate cut was ""an encouraging sign"".

The end of the grace period means that people who fail to comply with the rules face fines of up to HK$100,000.

According to the rules, restaurants are prohibited from using or selling polystyrene utensils, plastic straws, cutlery and plates.

Hotels are also banned from freely distributing bathroom items made of plastic, including plastic-handled toothbrushes, plastic-packed toothpaste and shower caps.

Other prohibited products include cotton buds, umbrella bags and glow sticks.

Edwin Lau, founder and executive director of The Green Earth, said eateries and hotels are generally adapting well to the new regulations.

“Through my observation, I gathered that most of the restaurants... I think most of them have done a good job to follow the single-use plastics ban, and they quickly can find the alternative.

“I am aware that for the hotel industry they are still trying to find an alternative for shower caps. But apart from this item, the rest of the items, I heard them saying that hotels are quite alright in getting all those other alternatives or advising customers to use their own private sets,” he told RTHK.

The second phase, set to begin in 2025, will extend the ban to include plastic cups, food containers for takeouts, as well as plastic dental floss and tablecloths.

Lau sees no difficulties for businesses to adjust to the regulations, adding that phase 2 should be rolled out as soon as possible.

“I'm sure with the first phase, they have adapted to the changes quite well. And I believe they are well-prepared for the introduction of the second phase of the single-use plastics ban. You can see there are many non-plastic alternatives for takeaway lunch box, congee bowl, and this is no big problem for them,” he said.

Lau also noted that currently, many alternatives for plastic products are still of the single-use type, and officials should enhance promotion and encourage people to bring their own lunch boxes and cutlery.

The Environmental Protection Department estimated that the catering sector has cut down on the use of 30 million sets of disposable cutlery since April.

In a statement, the department also noted that 80 percent of customers at chain restaurants have stopped using takeaway cutlery, while 30 percent of eateries have decided to stop providing disposable cutlery for takeaways."

Various government departments and firms were recruiting staff at a job fair held on Sunday by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). One of them was a franchised bus company offering positions such as bus captains, technicians and customer service officers.

Citybus said all Chinese guidelines have been translated into English to accommodate ethnic minority workers. It also said the requirement for bus captains now is basic communication in Cantonese, compared with reading and writing Chinese and speaking fluent Cantonese in the past.

The firm has about 30 ethnic minority staff.

""I think they are quite embedded in our whole population, our local bus captains are happy to work with them. All the people in the company, they know that the company is an inclusive employer,"" said Citybus general manager Roger Wong.

Rojal, who's from Nepal and has been in Hong Kong for almost a decade, submitted an application with a bank.

He said he found it hard to land a job here because of language barriers.

""The employers are really looking for someone who actually can speak the language,"" he said. ""I'm not exactly sure why that's the case, perhaps the clients want you to speak in Chinese or the documents could be in Chinese."" 

Another job seeker, Bharvani, echoed the sentiment.

""Even though I studied here, my Chinese reading and writing skills are not that great. So it (throws out) at least half or three-fourths of the job opportunities,"" said the ethnic Indian who was born and raised in Hong Kong.

In his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee announced plans to regulate subdivided units, renaming the vetted flats ""basic housing units"" (BHUs) and making those smaller than 86 square feet illegal.

Ho said if all goes smoothly, laws would be passed by the end of next year, and that would be followed by a period for landlords to register and a grace period for them to renovate the flats to meet the new requirements.

""[If] a one-year registration period is enough, that would take us to the end of 2026,"" she said on a Commercial Radio programme.

""If landlords don't register during the period and continue to operate homes that violate our regulations, then law enforcement could begin at the end of 2026, or at the start of 2027 at the earliest. That's within the term of the current administration.""

Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who heads a government task force on the matter, said the timeline is not set in stone, citing an upcoming public consultation exercise and discussion with lawmakers.

Wong also said he doesn't think there'll be a significant drop in supply, pointing to the availability of more BHUs in the market in future.

He added that among tenants of current subdivided flats, 60 percent of them are eligible to apply for public housing and the rest could look for BHUs or transitional housing units, insisting everyone will have a roof over their heads.

On a TVB programme, Lee said landlords of subdivided flats are allowed to raise rents by a maximum of 10 percent under existing rent-control laws. The CE also said tenants can move from one BHU to another in future, in the event rents go up."

In his Policy Address on Wednesday, Lee announced a revision of the allocation ratio for the subsidised flats, changing it from 4:6 to 5:5 between green form, or current public housing residents, and white form applicants.

During a TVB programme aired on Sunday, the CE was asked whether the move was intended to ""pressure"" the general public into pursuing private property to boost the market, given the quota for green form applicants had not been fully utilised in the past two years.

""Don't resort to conspiracy theories,” Lee said in response.

“Frankly, when you're allocating housing, flexibility is crucial.

“The ratio between green and white form applicants could be different every single time. If one side doesn't use up the quota, then it could be re-allocated. There can easily be differences, and it's the role of the government to adjust these.”

Lee also rejected suggestions the revised allocation favours well-off public housing tenants, who are being urged to move out in accordance with government policy.

""Typically we expect a duration of about 10 years for residents to make progress. Then we'll give them the opportunity to return the public housing units to those who need them. I believe this approach is reasonable,” he said. 

Meanwhile, Lee said the relaxation of mortgage rules as announced in this year's Policy Address was based on the assessment that the private housing market is developing in a healthy manner.

Under the new policy, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for all homes has been adjusted to 70 percent, regardless of their value, and the maximum debt servicing ratio has been raised to 50 percent. 

The CE said he has not detected speculation following the change, and stressed that the chances of speculative activity under present market conditions are very low."

In announcing his Policy Address last week, Chief Executive John Lee spoke of the vision to turning Hong Kong into an operating centre for international commodity trading, including storage, delivery and shipping.

Chan, for his part, said commodities trading is an important part of economic activities as it could play a pivotal role in ensuring the stable supply of raw materials.

""Creating a commodity trading ecosystem can become a new point of support for the development of Hong Kong as an international financial, aviation and trading hub,"" he wrote on his weekly blog.

The minister said this could drive the development of aviation and trading for the Greater Bay Area, and offer stability to the supply chain in the region.

The priority is to boost trade volume in the short to medium term, Chan said.

The minister said as geopolitical uncertainties rise, demand for gold is expected to stay high for risk-averse investors, and some market players expect trade volume to multiply.

He said once the local infrastructure for gold storage and trading is built up, the SAR can further look into fostering closer links with the mainland gold market.

Chan said developing more risk-management and derivative products can help boost the country's global influence in the gold market in the long run.

Chief Executive John Lee announced in his Policy Address on Wednesday the setting up of a Working Group on Development Tourist Hotspots, which involves at least seven government departments. 

Speaking on a radio programme on Sunday, Cheuk, who leads the group, said it wants to develop projects that are inventive, attractive and feasible, and it's open to suggestions from the public.

""Hong Kong has a lot of resources for tourism, such as Victoria Harbour, food, films, etc. We will develop new projects involving the use of these resources,"" he said.

""For example food, you can see from YouTube a lot of tourists look for food in Hong Kong. This might be familiar to us but for tourists, it is very attractive. We can think about developing night markets, or building a food city. 

""Hong Kong also has its film culture and natural environment. We can also consider developing new photo-taking spots.""

Lee said on Saturday the working group will uncover must-see destinations across Hong Kong as it hopes to unearth hidden gems beyond Victoria Harbour.

Cheuk also said consumption habits of tourists have changed since the Covid-19 pandemic, and businesses have to think of new ways to attract tourists to spend.

""We cannot only complain about why tourists don't come here to spend. It's not that people don't spend money, there have to be places where they think it's worth spending money,"" he said. 

The official said tourists are more demanding nowadays and it is crucial to find products that are unique to Hong Kong to attract more visitors.

Separately, Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Kevin Yeung said he's confident his bureau will announce the Blueprint for Arts and Culture and Creative Industries Development soon.

The CE said in the Policy Address that the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau needs more time to come up with the blueprint.

""We received a lot of opinions, and we made big changes due to changes in the economy. In this case, we hope to have thorough discussions with the Culture Commission, and there may be changes after that. We will also have to include good suggestions in the blueprint. We still hope to announce the blueprint as soon as possible,"" Yeung said."

The latest death involves a common squirrel monkey, which had been put under isolated surveillance since nine other animals died about a week ago.

Officials said a necropsy will be conducted to find out the cause of death.

Two other animals, a common squirrel monkey and a De Brazza's Monkey, are in isolation.

Speaking to reporters after attending a radio programme on Sunday, Yeung said there are no abnormalities among some 70 monkeys at the zoo in Central.

""Because of the latest death, the relevant departments have held another meeting and we visited the gardens. Overall, we think [the preventive measures] in place are sufficient, and we'll continue with this plan,"" he said.

""There are still two other monkeys in isolation, and we'll take care of them. We know their condition may go up and down, sometimes they're better and sometimes worse. If there's anything new we'll definitely update the public.""

On Friday, the government said the nine monkeys died of sepsis after catching melioidosis, potentially because workers dug up soil near their habitat.

Autopsies found a large amount of the melioidosis-inducing bacteria in the monkeys' organs.

Officials added that the bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted from animals to humans."

In this week's Policy Address, the chief executive said the government will set up a working group that will explore how the city can benefit from the use of drones and other aerial technology to provide services such as transporting goods and people. 

Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong, who led the working group, told a press conference that officials will work with industry partners on pilot projects, starting applications at the end of this year and launching ""regulatory sandboxes"" early next year.

""We expect that the first phase will mainly focus on aerial monitoring and some drone cargo delivery, such as delivering food and transporting lightweight goods like mail and medications,"" he said. 

""We also hope that the pilot locations and routes can cover areas in Hong Kong with different terrains, landscapes, and densities. Some areas that could be considered include Science Park, Cyberport, outlying islands, and the Northern Metropolis.""

This plan requires amending existing laws and creating new ones, especially a regulatory framework for drones over 25 kg. 

Wong said the government aims to submit a draft bill to the Legislative Council in early 2025. 

He said while the mainland's low-altitude economy is growing rapidly, it's too early to estimate Hong Kong's potential revenue from this sector. 

""As our work is in its initial stages, it would be somewhat unrealistic to mention many specific figures at this point or to predict future economic contributions. This is because the mainland is a bit ahead of us in this area, and their data comes from big data."""

He said that the total amount of recycling has increased by more than half in the past six months. 

""We saw when we were advertising the waste scheme that even though public opinion was to postpone it, people were very supportive of waste reduction and recycling practices. So we are now seizing the opportunity by enhancing recycling facilities and strengthening public education to promote a good waste reduction and recycling culture in society,"" he said. 

""We will also study how to optimise the waste charging scheme so that people can be more adaptable and accepting of waste reduction and recycling measures when implemented in the future.""

The relaunch of the principal moratorium scheme provides breathing space for SMEs under the SFGS.",2024-10-22 12:30,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1775134-20241018.htm,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) on Friday rolled out new capital rules and various support measures aimed at assisting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including HK$370 billion in dedicated funds offered by banks. 

The measures include allowing banks to apply more favourable capital requirements for larger enterprises. 

The new regulation, which is set to take effect in January next year, will cover businesses with annual turnover of up to HK$500 million – an increase from the previous cap of HK$100 million.

The Countercyclical Capital Buffer has also been reduced from 1 percent to 0.5 percent with immediate effect, allowing banks to lend more freely and reducing their loan costs.  

The authority added that 16 banks participating in the Taskforce on SME Lending have set aside a total of over HK$370 billion in dedicated funds for SMEs. 

“About that HK$370 billion dedicated funds for SMEs, that is actually more about a commitment by those banks involved in making sure that the supply of the credit will be there, but of course subject to prudent risk management,” said HKMA executive director Carmen Chu. 

A deputy chief executive at the authority, Arthur Yuen, said the dedicated funds are not a static figure and can be adjusted based on market conditions. 

“We will continue to discuss with the banks through the taskforce whether there's any room for further enhancing or increasing that number,” he said. 

Yuen said the taskforce, established in August, has received over 100 enquiries so far, with almost half requiring no intervention. 

“But the taskforce did look into the remaining 60 percent of the cases and in some of the cases it involves communications between banks and customers. Some involve the processing time. Some involve the request for documents”, Yuen said.  

“Some also relate to how banks actually interact with customers when they are processing the application, whether they can smoothen some of the requests for information, et cetera. So the taskforce has been involved in sorting out some of those procedural sort of enhancements,” he said.

Yuen also said the relaunch of the principal moratorium scheme, announced in this year’s Policy Address, will provide “important breathing space” for SMEs to transition. 

SMEs are entitled to the moratorium if they borrow money through the government-backed SME Financing Guarantee Scheme (SFGS).

“We talked about digital transformation and green transformation, but for SMEs to go through digital transformation and green transformation, they need time, they need continuous support from the banking industry. So having the SFGS principal moratorium re-introduced is an important breathing space for that sort of transformation process to start,” Yuen said."

Officials addressing a post-data press conference on Friday expressed confidence the economy can achieve the government's full year growth target of around 5 percent, underpinned by further policy support and another cut to the amount banks must hold in reserve.

""Based on our comprehensive assessment, the economy in the fourth quarter is expected to continue the stabilisation and recovery trend that occurred in September. We are fully confident in achieving the full-year target,"" Sheng Laiyun, deputy head of The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), told reporters.

The NBS also said in a statement that the economy was “generally stable with steady progress” even in the face of a “complicated and severe external environment” and complicated domestic economic development.

China's growth rate in the first three quarters of the year was 4.8 percent.

On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded 0.9 percent in the quarter that ended in September, up from 0.7 percent growth in the previous quarter.

For the first three quarters, China's factory output rose 5.8 percent, while retail sales expanded 3.3 percent compared to the same period last year.

However, property investment sank 10.1 percent and the value of new home sales plunged 22.7 percent.

Ahead of the release of the new data, state media said China’s top banks had cut interest rates on yuan deposits for the second time this year as part of a move to boost lending.

Mainland policymakers have in recent weeks unveiled a raft of measures to funnel cash into the economy including a string of rate cuts and loosened restrictions on home-buying.

The central bank on Friday launched one such measure – a swap facility for funds and insurers with an ""initial application quota exceeding 200 billion yuan"", state media said.

The mechanism implemented by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) will provide greater liquidity for capital markets, which policymakers hope will offer support for the wider economy.

And in a possible sign of more relief to come, PBoC chief Pan Gongsheng said on Friday that officials were considering a further cut to the amount commercial lenders must hold in reserve before the end of the year. 

Last week, China's finance minister pledged to ""significantly increase"" debt to revive growth, but left investors guessing on the overall size of the stimulus package. (Agencies)

The one-year fixed-term deposit interest rate was cut by 25 basis points to 1.1 percent, according to the official deposit interest rates released by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of Communications.
   
This was the second deposit interest rate cut for state-owned big banks in 2024, with the previous cut implemented in July. 

Meanwhile, China's central bank and financial regulators have held meetings with key financial institutions, urging them to swiftly implement expansive policies to support the economy and the capital markets.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website on Friday that it urged participants to boost credit support for the real economy, and maintain reasonable growth in the total amount of money and credit.

It also urged solid implementation of interest rate adjustments, as well as two funding schemes created to support the stock market.

China's banking and securities regulators also chaired the meeting, and participants included banks, brokerages and fund companies.

Also on Friday, the governor of China's central bank, Pan Gongsheng, warned against any illegal fund flows into the stock market, state media said, following recent measures to support domestic capital markets.

The PBOC introduced two new tools in September to support markets.

These were a swap programme giving funds, insurers and brokers easier access to funding for stock buys, and relatively cheap PBOC loans to help banks finance listed companies' share purchases and buybacks.

Speaking at a financial forum in Beijing, Pan said the two measures were based entirely on market-oriented principles, and the swap facility was not a form of direct financial support from the central bank.

The bank's provisions regarding stock buybacks and purchases have specific directional aims, and the fundamental bottom line was that loan funds must not unlawfully enter the stock market, Pan added. (Xinhua/Agencies)

英格蘭職業球證公司主管韋比表示，獨立關鍵比賽事故小組成員包括前球員，他們每星期都對各個VAR決定進行討論和判斷，從而得出有關數據。

這名曾經擔任英超球證的主管又認為，VAR在大部分時間發揮很好作用，並得到廣泛認同，未來更重要的是減少決策所需的時間。他說，上季VAR的平均決策時間是每場70秒，今季是25秒，情況已經好好多。

今年6月，狼隊發起投票要求廢除VAR，英超20個球會投票後，結果有19票贊成保留VAR，只有狼隊反對。而受英超委託進行的一項獨立調查亦顯示，五分之四的球迷希望在聯賽中保留VAR。"

Overall sales rose 0.4 percent to US$714.4 billion between August and September, according to Commerce Department data, beating analysts' expectations.

In August, sales edged up just 0.1 percent to US$711.3 billion.

Excluding auto and gas station sales, the overall monthly rise would have been even higher at 0.7 percent in September, the report added.

While the US central bank had kept interest rates high for a large part of the year -- raising the cost of borrowing for households and businesses to tamp down inflation -- consumer spending has been more robust than expected.

Households have been drawing down on savings from the Covid-19 pandemic period, and the economy could be given a further boost with the Federal Reserve starting to lower rates more recently.

Compared with the same month a year ago, retail sales were up 1.7 percent in September.

Pantheon Macroeconomics noted in a recent report that ""with growth in labour income slowing, credit conditions remaining tight and households recently having exhausted their excess savings, we expect growth to slow sharply over the next couple of quarters.""

Pantheon analysts added that ""Hurricane Helene probably landed too late in the month"" to have an impact on the sales figures, ""and was too localized to have a major impact on national sales."" (AFP)"

The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a surge towards AI across a spectrum of industries.

TSMC posted a net profit of T$325.3 billion (US$10.11 billion) for the quarter which ended September 30, compared with the T$300.2 billion predicted by analysts.
 
TSMC, Asia's most valuable publicly listed company, said third-quarter revenue rose 36 percent year-on-year to US$23.5 billion, better than the company's previous forecast of up to US$23.2 billion. 

TSMC is spending billions of dollars building new factories in other parts of the world, including US$65 billion on three plants in the US state of Arizona.

On its last earnings call in July, TSMC raised its full-year revenue forecast and adjusted its capital expenditure plans for this year to between US$30 billion and US$32 billion.

The AI boom has helped drive up TSMC shares, with its Taipei-listed stock leaping 75 percent so far this year, compared with a 28 percent gain for the broader market, giving it a market capitalisation of around US$840 billion. (Reuters)"
China boosts credit to shore up property market,2024-10-17 11:42,"China announced additional measures to support its ailing property market, including expanding a ""white list"" of eligible housing projects for financing and increasing bank lending. Minister Ni Hong also mentioned plans to renovate a million urban homes and resettle people to absorb inventory.

The central bank has also reduced minimum down payment ratios and interest rates on mortgages.",2024-10-22 12:30,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1774941-20241017.htm,"China said on Thursday it would boost the credit available to the ailing property market and help renovate a million homes as it unveiled another round of measures to shore up the sector and try to reignite the economy.

Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said Beijing would expand a ""white list"" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to four trillion yuan. 

Redevelopment of cities will also gather pace, with a million ""urban villages"" to be included in such plans, Ni said at a press conference, adding that people being resettled would help absorb existing housing inventories.

The pledges for more financing for cash-strapped developers and urban redevelopments are part of a series of measures announced in recent weeks aimed at stabilising a sector that plunged into crisis in 2021 and has acted as a drag on growth in the world's second largest economy.

""It can be said that the bottoming out of the property market has begun,"" Ni told reporters.

In January, China announced a plan for a ""white list"" of projects that can receive financing to ensure that developers could complete construction and deliver homes to buyers. 

As of this summer, banks had approved 5,392 such projects, with financing reaching nearly 1.4 trillion yuan.

Approved loans for the ""white list"" projects had risen to 2.23 trillion yuan as of October 16, Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of the State Financial Regulatory Administration, said at the press conference.

On Saturday, finance ministry officials also announced measures to prop up the property sector, allowing local governments to use funds from special bonds to buy unsold homes and idle land.

In late September, the central bank announced measures including cuts in the minimum down payment ratio to 15 percent for all buyers.

Interest rates on existing mortgages are expected to drop by an average half a percentage point, benefiting 50 million households and 150 million residents, Tao Ling, a deputy governor at the central bank, said at the same press conference.

The rate cuts helped households save 150 billion yuan, she said.

Since last year, China had implemented incremental policies to lift home buyer confidence amid concerns about persistently declining home prices, timely deliveries of homes by developers, and the status of their own jobs and incomes in a fragile economy. (Agencies)"
