朗廷表示，香港高端及豪華酒店競爭激烈，旗下酒店組合，尤其香港朗廷酒店，受到持續價格戰的嚴重影響，平均房租因為尖沙咀區的激烈競爭而跌近10%；香港康得思酒店及香港逸東酒店的平均房租則保持穩定。

期內，總租金收入跌約22%至4.02億元。餐飲業務收入跌3.6%，由於消費者消費模式轉變，以及婚禮活動較少。客房及餐飲收入下跌、勞動力成本上升、網上旅遊代理商佣金水平提高、洗滌成本增加，都削減利潤。"

醫管局說，今年初已開展有關預備工作，初步預計分階段重整需時一年多，最快明年完成。

另外，當局將適時增設「新界北聯網」，並調整新界東及新界西聯網的服務範圍。當局估計，新界人口將持續上升，威爾斯親王醫院及屯門醫院將分別繼續作為新界東及新界西聯網的主要急症醫院。為配合北都發展，政府已於牛潭尾預留用地，興建新一間綜合醫教研的急症醫院作為北都的旗艦醫院，提供約3000張病床，為北都的新增人口提供全面醫療服務。

至於九龍區，當局認為，未來人口增幅相對輕微，但考慮到九龍區位處香港中心位置，日間醫療需求將繼續維持一定水平，加上人口老化，因此計劃維持現行九龍東、九龍中及九龍西聯網的劃界，並一併規劃3個聯網，以應付預計的日間醫療服務需求。

立法會衞生事務委員會明日開會討論有關聯網規劃詳情。"

At most 100 runners, six from Hong Kong, will take part in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Marathon, which doubles as a test event for the 15th National Games. 

The event later this month features a men's race and a women's race. 

The women’s race begins at 7am while the men’s race starts half an hour later.

The athletes will run for two kilometres in Shenzhen before entering Hong Kong through the Shenzhen Bay Port. 

They will run along the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor towards the south until they get to the turning point. 

The Hong Kong section is about 21 kilometres in total.

Ken Wong, the Transport Department's principal transport officer, urged passengers to use the MTR East Rail Line to travel to Shenzhen via Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau on the day.    

He also urged motorists to steer clear of  border points while the race is on. 

“According to operating records on a typical Sunday, there will be about 26,000 passengers, two-bound, using Shenzhen Bay Port... and according to our records, there will be about 2,000 cross-boundary private cars using Shenzhen Bay Port on a typical Sunday,” he said. 

There will be no spectators for this event.  

“Because the Hong Kong session for this race will be mostly either on the highway or in the restricted area near the cross boundary control points, so for this time there will not be any public viewing area for the general spectators,” Yeung Tak-keung, the head of the National Games Coordination Office said.  

The race will be broadcast live on RTHK’s website. 

Yeung added that customs clearance arrangements for the athletes will be similar to the cross-border cycling test event in November last year. 

“The athletes have to submit their information to the organising party. Once verified, there will be a facial recognition and the ID and passports will have to be vetted beforehand,” he said 
 
He added that  runners have to go through another round of inspection on the race day."

大熊貓熱潮下，龐建貽說，能為公園增加收入，聖誕及新年期間公園的人流及收入按年多3成，農曆新年則按年升1成；去年12月及今年1月的產品銷售量按年升約2成，當中不少產品以大熊貓為主題。"

控方表示，案件涉及142名丁屋申請人，兩名被告的最終目標是利用這些申請人的丁權，誘使地政總署批出建築許可證，以推動名為曉門(Hillwood)的屋苑發展項目。142名申請人中有138人不符合資格，因為他們並非同時擁有丁權及土地，王光榮控制的榮佳建築公司2014年至2019年期間，售出115棟曉門房屋，賺取10億7800萬元。

控方陳詞又說，兩名被告在案的串謀協議中，扮演關鍵角色，榮佳建築與程振明就有關發展項目達成諮詢服務協議，內容包括讓程振明擔任受託人，委託王光榮為戰略夥伴及發展項目的組織者，報酬包括項目的15%純利潤，王光榮為王潘律師行合夥人，142名丁屋申請人授權王潘律師行處理申請。

""The US move is essentially an act of trade protectionism,"" the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) said in a statement published by state broadcaster CCTV.

""In the short term, the impact on (China's) steel exports is limited,"" the CISA said in the report.

""But in the long term, the US move could lead other countries to follow suit, thereby reducing (China's) steel export competitiveness,"" it added.

Despite being the world's top producer of steel, China last year accounted for only a small proportion of US steel imports.

But with demand slumping in the domestic construction sector, Chinese steel exports have surged, spurring concerns in Washington about overcapacity in foreign markets with harmful effects on US producers.

US President Donald Trump signed executive orders on Monday slapping new 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on March 12.

""From a medium- and long-term perspective, the (US) increase in tariffs will have an adverse impact on industrial and supply chains in the global steel industry, including the Chinese steel industry,"" CISA deputy secretary-general Zhang Longqiang said, according to CCTV. (AFP)"

He expressed his gratitude to Chief Executive John Lee and Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism Rosanna Law for visiting the injured players after the scuffle.

Coach Carey Durant said the team dealt with the adversity very well.

He said the team's performance in Harbin would be used for what he called, ""a measuring stick” to roll out development plans for the association, as well as the sport itself.

""There were a lot of tears when we lost those games. And that's a good thing because that means our players expected to go all the way to try and win a gold medal,"" he said.

The firms said in a joint statement that they ""agreed to terminate the MOU (memorandum of understanding) signed on December 23 last year for consideration of a business integration between the two companies"".

The firms' intention to join forces had been seen as a bid to catch up with US titan Tesla and Chinese firms in the electric vehicle market.

Honda's CEO insisted in December that it was not a bailout for Nissan, which last year announced thousands of job cuts after reporting a 93 percent plunge in first-half net profit.

Local media reports have said the discussions unravelled after Honda proposed to make its struggling rival a subsidiary instead of the plan, announced in December, to integrate under a new holding company.

In the joint statement, the automakers confirmed Honda ""proposed changing the structure from establishing a joint holding company... to a structure where Honda would be the parent company and Nissan the subsidiary through a share exchange"".

""As a result of these discussions, both companies concluded that, to prioritise speed of decision-making and execution of management measures in an increasingly volatile market environment heading into the era of electrification, it would be most appropriate to cease discussions and terminate the MOU,"" the statement said.

They will, however, continue to ""collaborate within the framework of a strategic partnership aimed at the era of intelligence and electrified vehicles, striving to create new value and maximise the corporate value of both companies,"" it added. (AFP)"

'Higher tram fares would help operator retain talent',2025-02-13 13:43,"Hong Kong Tramways seeks to increase fares for adults, children, and seniors due to a 15% decrease in passenger numbers. Union chief Yeh Yung-sheng argues that the fare hike is necessary to attract and retain skilled workers with specialized training. However, lawmaker Chan Hok-fung cautions that higher fares may lead to further loss of passengers, as trams currently lack a competitive price advantage. Chan suggests alternative methods, such as themed trams, to boost passenger numbers. The proposed fare increases would primarily fund fleet renovation and non-ticket revenue projects.",2025-02-13 23:15,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1791449-20250213.htm,"An increase in tram fares would enable the operator to put wages up to find and keep hold of talent, a union chief said on Thursday.

Hong Kong Tramways is hoping to get the go-ahead to increase adult fares from HK$3 to HK$3.30, child fares from HK$1.50 to HK$1.60 and fares for the over 65s from HK$1.30 to HK$1.50.

The company says passenger figures are still about 15 percent down on 2018, before the protests and Covid pandemic. 

The chairman of the Hong Kong Tramway Workers Union, Yeh Yung-sheng, said fare increases would help the company attract new workers, some of whom would need to learn specialist skills.

""The whole of the tram's chassis is made by hand. It's not built from parts that are bought from the market... So we need to pass on such techniques,"" he told RTHK.

""You cannot just find any workers who can do such work, and it takes time for us to train such workers. [So] if the pay is not good enough, then they might feel that they do not want to learn such techniques.""

But speaking on the same RTHK programme, lawmaker Chan Hok-fung, who is a member of Legco's transport panel, said Hong Kong Tramways will lose even more passengers if fares go up. 

""At present, with the existing prices, trams do not have the so-called competitive advantage. And if you raise the fares further, the gap between the fares of trams and those of buses will be further narrowed, and then even more passenger traffic will be lost,"" he said.

""The advantage of trams in the past was not their speed, but their prices, because it was cost-effective, but if they do not even have that advantage, their original passengers will be lost."" 

Chan said the company could instead take steps to boost passenger numbers, for example by introducing Pokémon or panda-themed trams.

Hong Kong Tramways says the proposed fare increases would mainly be spent on renovating its fleet and expanding non-ticket revenue projects."

The consumer price index rose to 3.0 percent in January from a year ago, above the 2.8 percent projected by economists, raising questions about whether the Fed's progress on bringing down prices was reversing.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a congressional panel that the figures reinforced the central bank's recent cautious approach to interest rate cuts.

Among individual companies, CVS Health shot up 15 percent following better-than-expected earnings. The pharmacy chain company projected higher profits in 2025 compared with last year.

Gilead Sciences jumped 7.5 percent after reporting results that beat expectations as it signaled it could launch its latest HIV prevention drug in the summer of 2025.

In the airline's report to the Civil Aviation Department, it said a lack of internal communication and insufficient customer service support exacerbated the carrier's scheduling failures. 

Around 5,500 passengers were believed to have been affected by the cancellation of 128 flights in February and March.

According to details released on Wednesday, four of the cancellations were by a charterer which put on extra flights following the deadly plane crash in South Korea's Muan International Airport in December.

The airline also assured the move had ""no impact on the safety"" of its operations.

The report said the new team – comprising experienced personnel as part of a reform – had failed to observe the company's protocol for cancellation decision making, and also ""took excessive time to make decisions"" and ""communicated the decision poorly"".

It noted the team did not consider the airline's customer service response capability, which did not have sufficient resources to handle ""such a significant number of customer interactions at one time"".

""[The airline] remains committed to assuring a reliable service to our passengers. The new team concerned has been removed from the company,"" the report said.

Also in the report, the airline put forward a number of measures such as strengthening internal procedures for flight scheduling, boosting communication, and ensuring fleet and manpower stability and reliability.

Transport minister Mable Chan expressed hope Greater Bay Airlines had learned a lesson, adding it has to regularly report on its operations to the authorities.

""[The Air Transport Licensing Authority] has asked the airline to submit regular reports on a monthly basis. If the airline is planning to cancel flights in future, it will have to provide a written report to the authority and list out the facts and information of the arrangements,"" she said.

The airline initially cited a delay in new aircraft delivery and the need for plane inspections for the cancellation, but the report later revealed ""a lack of internal communication and a lack of co-operation from customer service operations"" as a contributing factor. 

""From the time when [the airline] shared information at the time of the incident, to now when there's been a detailed report outlining what happened, I believe this is a process,"" Chan said when asked if the carrier had given an inaccurate explanation at first.

The minister stressed the administration would consider an airline's operations and performance when making arrangements on flight allocations and air traffic rights.

In response, the low-cost carrier again apologised to affected passengers and said it had put in place a number of measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. 

""We will maintain close contact with the Transport and Logistics Bureau regarding the company's operations, and continue to strive to provide safe and reliable services to our customers,"" the airline said.

""Because they would use the same toilet in their department and that of course could be a place of transmission,"" he said.

""After using the toilet it would be humid, therefore it is possible that the virus was spread there.""

Yuen added, however, that since the washroom in question would have been sanitised before samples were taken, the likelihood of finding E.coli there is slim.

Three oncologists at the hospital are thought to have caught E. coli. While one died last Friday, the other two only had mild symptoms.

Strengthening Hong Kong's role as a financial services hub is key to attracting investors.",2025-02-13 23:15,elocal,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1791274-20250212.htm,"The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Christopher Hui, says the administration is working to make renminbi trading more convenient in the SAR.

In last year’s Policy Address, the chief executive stated the government wants to promote the global use of renminbi and solidify the city's position as an offshore renminbi business hub.

Currently, 24 securities listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange have adopted the dual-counter model, meaning they can be traded in either the Hong Kong dollar or renminbi.
 
On RTHK's Overview Policy programme, Hui noted the next step is to make the model accessible to investors in the Greater Bay Area.

""I feel that one very obvious trend after the pandemic is that, even though globalisation has been somewhat affected, regionalisation is very practical and is happening,"" he said.

""Trade between different countries in Asia has increased. When trade increases, there's really no need to use other currencies. I can use a currency that everyone is using.""

The minister also mentioned that the government is trying out different scenarios to expand the use of digital renminbi.

""On one hand, of course, if mainland residents come to Hong Kong, how does our system here accommodate them? If they want to use the digital renminbi, they can do so,"" he said.

Police received a report at 6:27am about a collision near Tai Po Road.

The truck driver allegedly lost control and mounted a slope, causing the vehicle to flip to its side and fall onto the motorcyclist.

The motorcyclist was eventually freed by firefighters and rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital with leg injuries.

The truck driver has since been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm.

At least one eastbound lane of the major thoroughfare had to be sealed off, creating a tailback which stretched several kilometres to Kwai Chung at one point.

Another accident in the opposite direction on Lung Cheung Road, near So Uk Estate, at around 8am saw Tsuen Wan-bound traffic pushed back all the way to Diamond Hill.

US trading partners expressed dismay and vowed retaliation to President Donald Trump's latest move – a plan to enact 25 percent tariffs on imported aluminium and steel from March 12.

Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated in congressional testimony that the US central bank was in no hurry to adjust monetary policy, leaving a cloudy outlook for additional interest rate cuts.

All three of the major US indices had opened lower, but the Dow Jones finished up 0.3 percent at 44,593.

'US steel tariffs may have limited impact on China',2025-02-11 21:03,"Trump announced a 25% import tax on steel and aluminum, effective March 4. Analyst predicts limited impact on China's steel sector due to reduced exports to US. Countries like Canada, Mexico, and Brazil will be hit hardest as they're top suppliers. Increased costs and potential job losses in Canadian steel/aluminum sectors expected. Indirect steel exports and Chinese manufactured goods may also be impacted due to US tariffs. Mainland steel-related shares declined following announcements.",2025-02-13 23:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1791212-20250211.htm,"An analyst on Tuesday said while United States president Donald Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs are expected to have a limited direct impact on China, countries such as the US' neighbours of Canada and Mexico will feel the pinch.

The comment came after Trump on Monday announced a 25-percent import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US ""with no exception"". The measures take effect on March 4. 

Vivian Yang, senior analyst at Chinese steel data provider, MySteel, told RTHK that the move will have limited impact on China's steel sector, as Beijing has already shifted away from the US market.

She said the volume of China's steel and aluminium exports are much lower when compared to 2018 when Trump announced an earlier round of steel tariffs. Only some 891,000 tonnes of steel were exported to the US from China last year, accounting for 0.8 percent of the nation's total steel exports in 2024, according to MySteel. 

Yang said nations including Canada, Mexico and Brazil will be hit the hardest as they are currently the US’ top suppliers of the two metals.

""Canada may face greater economic recursion as the tariffs could lead to increased production costs and potential job losses in the Canadian steel and aluminium sectors,"" she said. 

However, the Shanghai-based analyst warned that the new tariffs will still have an impact on China's ""indirect"" steel exports, such as automobiles, ships, and machinery.

""The White House had already imposed a 10 percent additional on all Chinese goods imports. And if Trump's targeted tariffs of up to 60 percent on all Chinese imports he claimed earlier is to be realised, the impact on Chinese manufactured goods would be huge, because almost all Chinese exported products would lose their price advantage and have no export profit,"" she said.

""Although China is exporting very little steel to the US directly nowadays, some Chinese steel products do make their way into the US by other channels, for example, some are purchased by foreign countries and re-shipped to the US, [so] these transshipment practices will be impacted,"" she added.

Mainland steel-related shares declined following the latest tariff announcements, with iron and steel manufacturing conglomerates Hesteel Group and Angang Steel's stocks falling over two percent."

Two other oncologists showed symptoms such as fever, stomach pain and diarrhoea. They are in stable condition, and one of them has been discharged.  

One faeces sample tested positive for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, while the other two samples, including from the deceased oncologist, came up negative for the bacteria. 

The Centre for Health Protection and microbiologists from the University of Hong Kong are searching for the infection’s origin. 

Albert Au, the head of the centre's communicable disease branch said food is one possible source of infection, but the three doctors did not eat the same food or visit the same restaurant. 

However, they ate in the same staff lounge. 

“Another possibility would be human-to-human transmission in an infectious environment,” Au said. 

“We have collected over 40 environmental samples from the Department of Oncology office and toilets. We are waiting for the results to confirm whether there was a cross infection due to the environment,” he added. 

University of Hong Kong microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung said it is rare to see an adult die from Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, and pointed out that the deceased doctor was healthy with no underlying illnesses. 

He called on other hospital staff who felt unwell not to take medicine without proper guidance, especially antibiotics, as it could worsen their condition. 

The hospital has sanitised possible areas of infection, and asked its staff to seek a doctor if they feel unwell.

Meanwhile, Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau expressed sadness over the oncologist’s death.

In a statement released late on Tuesday, Lo said the doctor “was still taking care of patients in the ward right before the onset of symptoms”.

“I am deeply moved by the doctor's professionalism, passion for work and care for patients,” Lo said, describing the young doctor as a role model for the healthcare profession.

“The Centre for Health Protection…is conducting epidemiological and environmental investigations into the incident at full strength, and will submit a report and give an account to the public as early as possible,"" he added.

They also propose merging government organizations to cut costs and consider a digital services tax for foreign telecom companies. The chamber advocates for a three-year tax exemption for companies relocating their headquarters to Hong Kong to attract foreign investment. The deficit is expected to be smaller due to fiscal consolidation measures like raising taxes on high earners and a double-tier property tax.",2025-02-13 23:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1791171-20250211.htm,"Hong Kong should provide more tax concessions to individuals and businesses in the coming fiscal year, according to the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce (HKGCC). 

It made suggestions across nine categories about the Budget, which is set to be released later this month, including suggestions on expenditure control and attracting foreign investment. 

Last December, officials said the deficit would be near HK$100 billion, more than double the original estimate of HK$48 billion.

The chamber’s chairwoman, Agnes Chan, said the public should not worry though, as the city's economy is gradually recovering from the pandemic. 

“The budget deficit at that time was caused by two major factors -- we have the employment subsidy, the e-consumption voucher. Both took the government [to] over a hundred billion [dollars in deficit]. So that contributed to that year's substantial budget deficit. Then the second year, 2023-24, and the border reopened in February, but we are recovering and the government had adopted a loose monetary policy,"" she said. 

""This year, the financial secretary is already saying it's going to be a smaller deficit because we are in a fiscal consolidation year. The measures include raising taxes on the high income earners, and having the double-tier property tax,"" she added. 

The HKGCC proposed a one-time exemption on salaries tax, personal assessment tax and corporate tax, with an upper limit of HK$3,000.

For small and medium sized enterprises, or SMEs, it suggested the government provide a long-term fixed-rate mortgage. 

Chan said both measures could reduce the burden towards taxpayers and stabilise the operation costs of SMEs. 

In terms of managing expenditure, she said a review of the government's structure would be needed, such as merging organisations with overlapping duties to cut costs. 

She said an example would be the Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises (Oases) and InvestHK, in which both offices aim to attract foreign investment. 

The chamber also said the government could consider setting up a digital services tax, in which foreign telecommunication companies providing entertainment or consumption services in the city would have to pay up to five percent in tax per year. 

As for foreign investment, it said a three-year tax exemption period could be granted to companies that relocate their headquarters back to Hong Kong."

He signed proclamations increasing aluminum tariff from 10% to 25%, eliminating country exceptions, and imposing new North American standards. Trump also mentioned potential tariffs on cars, chips, and pharmaceuticals. Criticism came from Canada, the largest steel importer, with shares of steel and aluminum companies reacting accordingly.",2025-02-13 23:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1791115-20250211.htm,"US President Donald Trump substantially raised tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Monday to a flat 25 percent ""without exceptions or exemptions"", although he agreed to consider an exemption on Australia.

In a telephone call with Australia’s prime minister on Tuesday that took place before the tariff rise, Trump said the US trade surplus with Australia was one of the reasons he was considering an exemption.

“We actually have a surplus,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about trade with Australia. “It’s one of the only countries which we do. And I told (Albanese) that that’s something that we’ll give great consideration to.”

Australia had an exemption from such tariffs during Trump’s first administration.

Trump signed proclamations raising the US tariff rate on aluminium to 25 percent from his previous 10 percent rate and eliminating country exceptions and quota deals as well as hundreds of thousands of product-specific tariff exclusions for both metals. 

Trump also will impose a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be ""melted and poured"" and aluminium to be ""smelted and cast"" within the region to curb US imports of minimally-processed metals.

As he signed the order at the White House, Trump said he would follow Monday's action with announcements about reciprocal tariffs on all countries that impose duties on US goods over the next two days, and said he was also looking at tariffs on cars, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals.

Asked about threats of retaliation by other countries against his new tariffs, Trump said: ""I don't mind.""

Monday's tariffs almost immediately drew criticism from Canada, the largest source of steel imports. 

Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, called Trump a destabilising force in the global economy.

Before the proclamations, shares in US steel and aluminium makers jumped, while shares in European and Asian steelmakers fell. The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and industry data. (Agencies)"

Traders expect minimal impact due to high profit margins and ability to pass costs to consumers. Vendors in Yiwu have sufficient orders and are not worried about finding replacement trade partners.",2025-02-13 23:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790966-20250210.htm,"Traders in China's export manufacturing hub of Yiwu shrugged off US President Donald Trump's tariffs and moves against China on Sunday, with some saying they made preparations to soften the blow.

Yiwu city in eastern Zhejiang province is the world's largest wholesale hub for small manufactured items, exporting products ranging from Christmas trees to costume jewellery globally, including to the United States.

""We predicted that he would assume power,"" Cheng Haodong, chairman of Beisi Group, a business which sells clothes to water bottles, told Reuters from their office in the city.

""After he assumed power, ok, how do we want to adjust? Actually it was prepared for in advance,"" he said.

They monitored information on overseas social media sites, he added, which led to them establishing a new factory for producing liquid laundry detergent in the US state of Tennessee in April.

Trump's campaign promised 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports before he was elected. However, he revised that to 10 percent after taking office, which took effect on Tuesday. He also plans to cancel duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China.

“This time actually the shock won't be too big for us,” said Cheng, who declined to provide detailed figures on sales.

Beisi exports to other businesses abroad, but also sells some of its products directly to US consumers through online platforms such as Temu and Shein, low-priced shopping sites that analysts expect will be hard hit by Trump's repeal of the 'de minimis' rule - a trade loophole that allowed low-value imports to enter the country duty-free.

Similar sentiments were shared by traders and buyers in the sprawling market in the city, where many were just returning to work after the end of the eight-day Lunar New Year break.

""(Even if) you increase (the tariff) to 50 percent it won't have any effect on us,"" said Zeng Hao, owner of Jinqi Wanju which sells toys such as brightly-coloured dinosaur figurines.

That was because the products are highly profitable and his firm could absorb some of the tariff burden, he said. Companies down the supply chain also have reason to increase their own prices, he added.

Abby Jin, who buys products in Yiwu on behalf of other customers in markets such as the US, Australia and the Middle East, said vendors in the city were not short of orders.

""We can respond by slighting reducing our profit margins or adjusting costs. In the end, the additional costs will be passed on to the end consumers in their country, meaning they will ultimately bear the consequences of their own economic policies,” she said.

“For the US, whether they can find a suitable country to replace us (as a trade partner) is a question they need to consider themselves."" (Reuters)"

Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on his way to the NFL Super Bowl in New Orleans, said he will announce the new metals tariffs on Monday.

He also said he will announce reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, to take effect almost immediately, applying them to all countries and matching the tariff rates levied by each country.

""And very simply, it's, if they charge us, we charge them,"" Trump said of the reciprocal tariff plan.

The largest sources of US steel imports are Canada, Brazil and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to government and American Iron and Steel Institute data.

Trump also said that while the US government would allow Japan's Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, it would not allow this to become a majority stake.

""Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it has good management,"" Trump said of US Steel.

Trump, during his first term, imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium, but later granted several trading partners duty-free exemptions, including Canada, Mexico and Brazil.

Former president Joe Biden later negotiated duty-free quota arrangements with Britain, the European Union and Japan. It was not immediately clear from Trump's announcement what would happen to those exemptions and quota arrangements.

Steel mill capacity usage jumped to levels above 80 percent in 2019 after Trump's initial tariffs, but has fallen since then as China's global dominance of the sector has pushed down steel prices.

NBS statistician Dong Lijuan said the increase in January was due largely to the influence of the Spring Festival holiday.

The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.6 percent from a year ago in January, up from the 0.4 percent increase in December.

On a monthly basis, the CPI expanded 0.7 percent in January.

Analysts said consumer spending over the holiday was mixed. While people flocked to movie theatres and spent more on shopping, catering and domestic travel, per capita spending during the holiday grew by only 1.2 percent from a year earlier, versus a 9.4 percent rise in 2024, analysts at ANZ estimated.

The NBS data also showed the country's producer price index (PPI), which measures costs for goods at the factory gate, went down 2.3 percent year on year in January, matching the drop the month before.

On a month-on-month basis, the PPI dropped 0.2 percent. (Xinhua/Reuters)"
Trump pauses de minimis repeal on Chinese imports,2025-02-08 11:32,"Trump pauses duty-free treatment repeal for Chinese packages, giving Commerce Department time to make it workable.

Revision signed and published by White House.",2025-02-13 23:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790798-20250208.htm,"US President Donald Trump paused his administration's repeal of duty-free treatment of low-cost packages from China on Friday, giving the Commerce Department time to make the order workable, after the rapid change created disruptions for customs inspectors, postal and delivery services and online retailers.

The eventual cancellation of de minimis means the more than 1 billion small-value e-commerce packages arriving annually in the United States with goods coming directly from China must switch to an entry process that requires additional information and duties, adding time and cost.

The stop and restart of the United States Postal Service acceptance of those packages this week set off a swarm of disruptions that backed up Customs clearance for packages, even those that had paid duties, at New York City's John F Kennedy International Airport.

""Well that was a fun Tuesday through Friday, if you work in global e-commerce,"" said Derek Lossing, CEO of e-commerce and global supply chain firm Cirrus Global Advisors.

The initial change, implemented with just over 48 hours' notice, caused the USPS to temporarily stop accepting packages from China earlier this week.

Popular online retailers including Shein, Temu and Amazon.com's new Haul service send packages directly from Chinese factories to US shoppers and use de minimis to keep prices low. 

The Trump administration's revision to the order was signed on Wednesday and published on Friday, a White House spokesperson said.

De minimis, a legal term referring to matters of little importance, refers to the US waiver of standard customs procedures and tariffs on items worth less than US$800 that are shipped to individuals from foreign countries.

Temu and Shein combined ship around 9,000 metric tons of cargo worldwide every day, or approximately 88 full Boeing 777 freighters, said Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer at freight pricing platform Xeneta.

""You cannot suddenly put up the shutters to this volume of air freight, so it is no surprise there has been a delay to the executive order on de minimis."" (Reuters)"

Total employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, according to the Labor Department, significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.

The January number was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000, according to Briefing.com.

Meanwhile, the jobless rate edged down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent, beating analyst expectations.

Wage growth was better than analysts expected, accelerating to 0.5 percent, the report showed.

The data added to signs that the US economy remained in excellent shape heading into Trump's second term, which began on January 20, analysts noted.

Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, took aim at downward revisions to last year's figures in the latest update, telling media that the Trump administration has ""a lot of work to do.""

""Taken together, December and January payroll figures paint a strong picture of the economy,"" added Carl Weinberg and Mary Chen of High Frequency Economics.

They said they expect that with these figures, the US central bank would not be in a rush to cut interest rates.

Sectors like health care, retail trade, and social assistance saw job gains, the Labour Department said, while employment declined in industries like mining, alongside oil and gas.

Economists warned that businesses may reconsider further hiring due to heightened tariff risks and Trump's plans to slow immigration. (AFP)"
Trump says to announce 'reciprocal' tariffs next week,2025-02-08 08:31,"Trump plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on multiple countries next week, fulfilling a campaign promise. He cited budget benefits and equal treatment. Auto tariffs remain a possibility. Trump discussed this with lawmakers during budget discussions. Increased tariffs could help offset costs of tax cuts, but have only accounted for 2% of revenues recently. Wall Street lost more and consumer sentiment dropped due to potential inflation.",2025-02-13 23:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790769-20250208.htm,"US President Donald Trump said on Friday he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs on many countries next week, a major escalation of his trade war. 

Trump made the announcement during a meeting with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.

Trump did not identify which countries would be hit but suggested it would be a broad effort that could also help solve US budget problems.

He said auto tariffs remained on the table amid reports that the White House was weighing potential exemptions.

""I'll be announcing that, next week, reciprocal trade, so that we're treated evenly with other countries,"" Trump said. ""We don't want any more, any less.""

The move would fulfil Trump's campaign promise to impose tariffs on American imports equal to rates that trading partners impose on American exports.

Trump told Republican lawmakers of his plans during budget discussions at the White House on Thursday, three sources familiar with the plan told Reuters. 

Trump and top aides have said they plan to use higher tariffs on foreign imports to help pay for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which independent budget analysts say could add trillions of dollars to the US debt.

Increased tariffs could offset some of that cost, though they have only accounted for about 2 percent of annual revenues in recent years.

Trump announced tariffs of 25 percent on Canada and Mexico on Saturday but delayed them after a negative reaction from investors. The two largest US trading partners agreed to increase enforcement efforts at the border, a top Trump priority.

Wall Street extended losses on Friday following the Reuters report of Trump's discussion with lawmakers.

US consumer sentiment dropped to a seven-month low in February, and attitudes soured among Republicans as households took stock of what they believe will be a surge in inflation from Trump's tariffs. (Reuters)"
"US markets spooked by tariff rhetoric, jobs data",2025-02-08 08:30,"U.S. and European shares declined on Friday due to weaker-than-expected job growth, higher inflation expectations, and trade war concerns. The Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite dropped 1%, 1%, and 1.4%, respectively. The U.S. added fewer jobs than expected in January, and consumer inflation expectations increased significantly. President Trump's remarks on potential reciprocal tariffs also contributed to market anxiety.",2025-02-13 23:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790781-20250208.htm,"US and European shares fell Friday, with the latest US jobs report and higher inflation expectations capping the end of a volatile week marked by concerns over a trade war.

Official data showed the United States added fewer jobs than expected in January while unemployment ticked down.

The jobs data missed expectations, but Wall Street's three main indexes initially rose. They quickly fell into the red, however, after separate data showed US consumers now expect inflation to jump.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down one percent at 44,303.40, the S&P 500 also lost one percent to 6,025.99 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 percent to finish at 19,523.40.

President Trump's remarks on unspecified ""reciprocal tariffs"" also appeared to reignite concerns.

Trump said at a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba that he was ""probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday,"" saying that this would be ""opposed to a flat-fee tariff"" approach.

""Today's (jobs) data does not show a large enough divergence from expectations to shift what is expected to be the Fed's next rate move,"" said Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.

""Still the Fed is expected to cut the Fed Funds rate twice this year and today's data does not really give a hint into when the first cut will be,"" Stanzl said.

The Fed kept its rate unchanged last week, with chair Jerome Powell saying the central bank was in no ""hurry"" to adjust borrowing costs again.

The Labor Department said total US employment rose by 143,000 jobs last month, which was significantly lower than the revised 307,000 figure in December.

The January figure was also below an analyst consensus estimate of 155,000 according to Briefing.com.

""We do not think that the labour market data shifts the dial for the Fed,"" said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading platform.

But data released afterward subsequently showed US consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level in July, with survey respondents reporting feeling less confident and more concerned about inflation.

Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 4.3 percent, up a full percentage point from a month earlier.

""Such a substantial one-month rise of one percentage point or more has occurred only five times in the past 14 years,"" noted Axel Rudolph, Senior Technical Analyst at online trading platform IG.

The jump in inflation expectations follows a turbulent week for stock markets and currencies after Trump imposed tariffs on China.

The US leader also warned that the European Union would face tariffs ""pretty soon"" while he delayed duties on Canada and Mexico at the 11th hour. (AFP)"
'Chinese e-commerce firms can prevail despite tariffs',2025-02-07 20:24,"US revoked de minimis rule, imposing 10% tariffs on Chinese goods worth less than $800. Analyst Catherine Lim suggests Chinese e-commerce firms like Temu and Shein can offset financial impact by adopting long-term planning, shipping intelligently, and shifting from aviation to sea freight. Turnarounds in trade policies are possible, according to Lim. Volatility expected but temporary, stabilizing in second half of the year.",2025-02-13 23:15,efinance,rthk,https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1790724-20250207.htm,"Chinese e-commerce companies would still be able to maintain healthy financial positions in the face of surging US tariffs - if they fine tune their business models with long-term planning, according to analysts. 

This came after the US on Monday revoked a long-standing de minimis rule that allowed packages worth less than US$800 to enter the country duty-free, as part of measures when US President Donald Trump signed the executive order to impose an extra 10 percent tariffs on Chinese goods.

The changes, while slapping additional duties on Chinese e-commerce firms such as Temu and Shein, could still offer an opportunity for them, if they conduct shipping planning intelligently, according to Catherine Lim, a senior consumer analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

""Bear in mind that some of these [de minimis shipments] are very random parcels that did not require inventory planning about shipping, like what most export-oriented products do, particularly those above the US$800 threshold,"" Lim told RTHK.

""The biggest change I would say right now for these e-commerce sellers who are using the de minimis is that they need to adopt longer-term planning. They need to start restructuring themselves so much so that they will have enough goods ahead of time at Temu's or Shein's specified warehouses, while still being in a position to actually distribute to the local consumers, to meet the demand of the US shoppers,"" she said. 

""That will offset the entire financial impact from the tariff hikes.""

One of the ways, she suggested, was for the mainland firms to shift away from aviation transport which is around 25 to 30 times more expensive than sea freight.

Separately, Lim said she believes there still could be turnarounds in terms of the trade policies from the US, as supply chain management processes undertake new regulations while authorities from China and the US, as well as the rest of the world, take steps to address the new procedures.

""We are going to go through a rather volatile couple of months, but this is temporary,"" Lim said.

""Into the second half of the year, I am expecting, barring any unforeseen changes to trade policies that this will start to stabilise into the end of the year."""
